He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact3>2 kilogram of tea per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for <fact4>₣2</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: The more expensive brand of tea costs <fact1>₣4</fact1> + <fact2>25%</fact2> of <fact1>₣4</fact1> = <fact1>₣4</fact1> + <fact1>₣1</fact1> = <fact1>₣5</fact1> per kilogram.
He buys tea for <fact3>7 days</fact3> and he uses <fact3>2 kilogram of tea per day</fact3>, so he buys <fact3>7</fact3> * <fact3>2</fact3> = <fact3>14</fact3> kilogram of tea.
So the total cost of the tea is <fact1>₣5</fact1> * <fact3>14</fact3> = <fact1>₣70</fact1>.
He also bought a muffin for <fact4>₣2</fact4>.
Therefore, the total cost of everything is <fact1>₣70</fact1> + <fact4>₣2</fact4> = <fact1>₣72</fact1>.

How many like to dance if the number that like to play video games is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact4>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to play music, basketball, or video games is <fact2>112</fact2> + <fact3>15</fact3> = 127 students.
Since there are <fact1>195</fact1> students in the class, the number of students who like to dance is <fact1>195</fact1> - <fact2>127</fact2> = 68 students.
The number of students who like to play video games is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact4>, so it is <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 30 students.

Answer: Since <fact2>there are 19 pineapples per square meter</fact2>, Ali has a total of <fact1>65 square meters</fact1> * <fact2>19 pineapples per square meter</fact2> = 1235 pineapples.
Since <fact3>Ali can harvest his pineapples every 4 months</fact3>, he can harvest <fact4>12 months</fact4> / <fact3>4 months</fact3> = 3 times a year.

Answer: <fact1>Mateo receives 100 emails a day</fact1>, so in a 3 day work week, he receives 100 * 3 = 300 emails. 
<fact2>14% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, so Mateo doesn't need to respond to 14% of 300 emails, which is 0.14 * 300 = 42 emails.

Answer: To find the total number of puppies, we add the number of puppies from Oliver's dog and Zahra's dog: <fact1>1045</fact1> + <fact3>515</fact3> = 1560 puppies in total.
We can find the total number of puppies with spots by adding the number of puppies with spots from Oliver's dog and Zahra's dog: <fact2>250</fact2> + <fact4>140</fact4> = 390 puppies with spots.
To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, then multiply by 100: (390 / 1560) * 100 = 25%.

If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of her walk, the rate at which Kimia walks on the beach is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>11/44</fact2> miles per minute.
Since <fact4>Kimia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the rate at which Kimia walks on the sidewalk is 2 * <fact2>11/44</fact2> = <fact7>22/44</fact7> miles per minute.
The time it takes for Kimia to walk <fact3>18 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> is <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / <fact7>22/44</fact7> miles per minute = <fact3>18 * 44 / 22</fact3> = 36 minutes.
The time it takes for Kimia to walk <fact2>11 miles on the beach</fact2> is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact2>11/44</fact2> miles per minute = 44 minutes.
Therefore, the total time it takes for Kimia to complete the entire <fact6>29-mile walk</fact6> is 36 minutes + 44 minutes = 80 minutes.

Answer: The total number of students who like to dance or play badminton is <fact2>74</fact2> + <fact3>6</fact3> = 80 students.
The number of students who like to read or paint is the total number of students minus the number of students who like to dance or play badminton, which is <fact1>186</fact1> - <fact5>80</fact5> = 106 students.

It takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>. If they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the maintenance worker spends cleaning rooms per day. Since it takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3> and they have to clean <fact1>160 rooms</fact1>, they will spend <fact1>160</fact1> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 2400 minutes cleaning rooms per day.
Since they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work a total of <fact4>10</fact4> * <fact5>60</fact5> = 600 minutes per day.
Therefore, they spend <fact6>2400</fact6> / <fact7>600</fact7> = 4 minutes out of every 10 minutes working on cleaning rooms.
To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we can divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (<fact6>2400</fact6> / <fact7>600</fact7>) * 100 = 400%.
However, this is not the correct answer. The question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, not the percentage of the total minutes spent cleaning rooms. To find the correct answer, we need to divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (<fact6>2400</fact6> / <fact7>600</fact7>) * 100 = 400%. Then we need to convert the fraction of the day into a percentage. 400% is equivalent to 4/10, which is equivalent to 2/5. 2/5 is equivalent to 40%. Therefore, the maintenance worker spends 40% of their day cleaning rooms.

He only wants enough <fact4>beets to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh</fact4>, so he buys <fact5>fourteen 5-kg bags</fact5>. <fact6>Corns are the main diet of his horses</fact6>, so he buys <fact7>thirty five 36-kg packs</fact7>. <fact8>Apples are a staple to supplement the corns</fact8>, so he buys <fact9>nineteen 15-kg sacks</fact9>. If his <fact10>farm truck can carry 110 kgs at a time</fact10>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Answer: The total weight of hay is <fact3>7</fact3> * <fact5>5 kg</fact5> = 35 kg.
The total weight of beets is <fact5>14</fact5> * <fact5>5 kg</fact5> = 70 kg.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>32% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?

Answer: To find the number of students who are leaving early, we need to find the total number of students who are either swimmers, debate team members, or part of the choir. 
First, we need to find the number of students who are not swimmers. Since <fact1>40% of the class are swimmers</fact1>, the number of students who are not swimmers is <fact1>100%</fact1> - <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60% of the class. 
The number of students who are not swimmers is <fact3>60%</fact3> * <fact1>125 students</fact1> = 0.6 * 125 = 75 students.
Out of the remaining 75 students, <fact3>32%</fact3> are debate team members or part of the choir. 
The number of students who are debate team members or part of the choir is <fact3>32%</fact3> * 75 = 0.32 * 75 = 24 students.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many plums Yuki has in total. Since <fact1>Yuki has 35 square meters of plum field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 78 plums per square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the total number of plums as <fact1>35</fact1> * <fact2>78</fact2> = 2730 plums.
Since <fact3>Yuki can harvest his plums every 2 months</fact3>, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12/2 = 6 periods of 2 months in a year.
Therefore, Yuki can harvest <fact4>2730</fact4> plums / <fact3>6</fact3> periods = 455 plums per period.
Since there are 6 periods in a year, Yuki can harvest a total of 455 * 6 = 2730 plums within a year.
However, this is the number of plums Yuki can harvest per period, not the total number of plums he can harvest in a year. Since Yuki can harvest all the plums in his field every 2 months, the total number of plums he can harvest in a year is still <fact4>2730</fact4> plums.

Answer: Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let <fact3>s</fact3> be the number of teaspoons of sugar and <fact4>w</fact4> be the number of cups of water. We know that <fact1>197</fact1> : <fact4>94</fact4> = <fact3>s</fact3> : <fact4>w</fact4>, so we can write <fact5>197w = 94s</fact5>. We are also given that <fact2>1455 = s + w</fact2>. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of <fact3>s</fact3>. Rearranging the second equation, we get <fact6>w = 1455 - s</fact6>. Substituting this into the first equation, we get <fact7>197(1455 - s) = 94s</fact7>. Expanding and simplifying, we get <fact8>288,095 - 197s = 94s</fact8>.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the 100 oz bag of cookies. Since there are <fact2>5 servings</fact2> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>450 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact1>450</fact1> = 2250 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact4>1525 calories</fact4>, you still have a daily calorie target of <fact3>1975</fact3> - <fact4>1525</fact4> = 450 calories left.
Now, we need to find out how many servings of cookies you can eat with the remaining calories. Since each serving has <fact1>450 calories</fact1>, you can eat 450/<fact1>450</fact1> = 1 serving.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pineapples are in Leon's field. Since there are <fact2>99 pineapples per square yard</fact2> and Leon has <fact1>90 square yards of pineapple field</fact1>, the total number of pineapples is <fact2>99</fact2> * <fact1>90</fact1> = 8910 pineapples.

Answer: Since <fact1>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact1>, he can harvest them twice within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months. 
First, we need to find out how many apricots <fact2>Luis has in total</fact2>. Since <fact1>he has 15 square yards of apricot field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 43 apricots per square yard</fact2>, he has <fact1>15</fact1> * <fact2>43</fact2> = 645 apricots in total.
Now, we need to find out how many apricots <fact3>Luis can harvest in 6 months</fact3>. Since he has 645 apricots in total and he can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 645/2 = 322.5 apricots in 6 months.

How many like to <fact4>play music</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>dance</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play hurling is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>34</fact3> = 41 students.
Since the rest of the students like to either play music or dance, the number of students who like to play music or dance is <fact1>189</fact1> - <fact2>41</fact2> = 148 students.
Let's assume the number of students who like to play hurling is x. Then, the number of students who like to dance is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>, which is 2x.
We know that the total number of students who like to dance or play music is 148. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 148.
Combine like terms: 3x = 148.
Divide both sides by 3: x = 49.33 (round down to 49 since we can't have a fraction of a student).
Now that we know x, we can find the number of students who like to dance: 2x = 2(49) = 98 students.
The number of students who like to play music is the total number of students who like to play music or dance minus the number of students who like to dance: 148 - 98 = 50 students.

After Noah takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat?
Answer: In the first 18 seconds, <fact1>80</fact1> kernels popped.
In the next 18 seconds, <fact2>2 times</fact2> that amount popped, so <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact1>80</fact1> = 160 kernels popped.
In the next 18 seconds, the kernels popped at <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, so <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>80</fact1> = 320 kernels popped.
In the final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact4>, so <fact4>half</fact4> of 320 popped, which is 320/<fact4>2</fact4> = 160 kernels popped.

If they work <fact4>7 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?
Answer: The cleaner has to clean <fact1>210 floors</fact1> in <fact2>10 days</fact2>. They work <fact4>7 hours each day</fact4>, which is <fact4>7</fact4>*<fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 420 minutes per day.

If he also paid <fact4>$330000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Mr. Brown's net proceeds from selling the villa?
Answer: The transfer fees are <fact2>1%</fact2> of <fact1>$480000</fact1>, so they amount to <fact2>1%</fact2> * <fact1>$480000</fact1> = $4800.
The brokerage fee is <fact3>2%</fact3> of <fact1>$480000</fact1>, so it amounts to <fact3>2%</fact3> * <fact1>$480000</fact1> = $9600.
Therefore, the total amount Mr. Brown paid in fees is $4800 + $9600 = $14400.

If <fact6>the cupcake cost ₣9</fact6> and <fact7>the grape pie cost ₣23</fact7>, how much did <fact8>Ibrahim earn for two days</fact8>?
Answer: On <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 boxes of cupcake</fact2> and <fact3>19 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Friday</fact3>. So on <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 - <fact3>19</fact3> = 7 boxes of grape pie.
On <fact4>Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday</fact4> and <fact5>28 boxes of grape pie</fact5>. So on <fact4>Friday, he sold 26 + <fact4>13</fact4> = 39 boxes of cupcake.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many wards are occupied at the beginning. Since <fact2>2/5</fact2> of the wards are occupied, the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>2/5</fact2> = 760 wards.
The total number of unoccupied wards at the beginning is <fact1>1900</fact1> - 760 = 1140 wards.
Since <fact3>50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is <fact3>50</fact3> * 21 = 1050 patients.
However, we are only interested in the number of wards, not the number of patients. Since each ward can accommodate 2 patients (as the number of occupied wards is 2/5 of the total wards), the total number of wards occupied by these patients is 1050 / 2 = 525 wards.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. 
To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

If he also paid <fact4>$480000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Mr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the cottage?

Answer: Mr. Jones paid <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$610000</fact1> = 0.03 * 610000 = $18300 for the transfer fees.
He also paid <fact3>5%</fact3> of <fact1>$610000</fact1> = 0.05 * 610000 = $30500 for the brokerage fee.

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d20 die is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4, since there are 10 even numbers on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total, and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we need to convert both probabilities to a common format. We can convert 14/20 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 14/20 = 0.7. We can convert 1/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/4 = 0.25.

The difference in probability is 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.45 * 100 = 45%.

Therefore, it is 45% more likely that Jin rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Answer: There are <fact2>50%</fact2> * <fact1>90 questions</fact1> = 45 geography questions. Zahra is sure to get <fact4>60%</fact4> * 45 geography questions = 27 geography questions correct.
There are <fact1>90 questions</fact1> - 45 geography questions = 45 questions that are either biology or literature. Since they are equally divided, there are 45/2 = 22.5 questions of each type.

Ava has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>.

However, during the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Ava is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Quinn decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Ava currently has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2>, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. Together, they have 30 + 37 = 67 signatures. Their goal is to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 67 = 68 signatures in the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Ava's collection will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so over the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> she will collect 5 * 2 = 10 fewer signatures than she did during the first <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>.  We don't know her exact rate during the first 3 weeks, but it's not necessary. We only need to know her reduction from the previous rate.

Therefore, Quinn needs to collect the remaining signatures herself, taking into account Ava's reduced rate: 68 signatures (total needed) - 10 signatures (Ava's reduction) = 58 signatures.  Since there are <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> left, Quinn needs to collect 58 / 2 = 29 signatures per week to reach their goal.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact11>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact11>. How much should Sakura pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins of wool needed for each grandchild.  For each grandchild, Sakura needs:

* Vest: <fact3>5 skeins</fact3>
* Cardigan: <fact4>4 skeins</fact4>
* Shawl: <fact5>10 skeins</fact5>
* Gloves: <fact6>12 skeins</fact6>
* Mittens: <fact7>9 skeins</fact7>

Total per grandchild: 5 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 40 skeins

Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 40 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 160 skeins for her grandchildren.

Next, let's calculate the wool needed for her jackets. She needs <fact9>4 skeins</fact9>/jacket * <fact8>2 jackets</fact8> = 8 skeins for herself.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Sakura needs is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.

Now, let's calculate the cost.  Since each <fact10>dozen (12) skeins costs $9</fact10>, the cost of 168 skeins is (168/12) * $9 = 14 * $9 = $126.

Finally, let's apply the discount. Since the total cost ($126) is <fact11>over $100</fact11>, Sakura receives a <fact11>$20 discount</fact11>.  So, the final amount Sakura should pay is $126 - $20 = $106.

Answer:  The cost of one muffin is one-eighth the cost of a loaf of sourdough, which is <fact1>$10</fact1> / 8 = $1.25. Since we are buying <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>, and this is more than <fact3>6 muffins</fact3>, we apply the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>.  The discount per muffin is $1.25 * 0.10 = $0.125.

After a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1330</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Nia bought <fact1>60 croissants</fact1>, which is 60/12 = 5 dozen croissants.  The cost of the croissants is 5 dozen * <fact1>$19/dozen</fact1> = $95.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons.  Nia bought <fact2>72 macarons</fact2>, which is 72/12 = 6 dozen macarons. The cost of the macarons is 6 dozen * <fact2>$20/dozen</fact2> = $120.

Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $95 + $120 = $215.  Let's denote the cost of the 36 brownies as 'x'.  So, before the discount, the total cost of all items was $215 + x.

Nia received a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, meaning she paid 95% of the original price.  Therefore, 0.95 * ($215 + x) = <fact5>$1330</fact5>.

To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 0.95: $215 + x = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400

Subtracting $215 from both sides, we find the total cost of the brownies: x = $1400 - $215 = $1185.

Finally, since Nia bought <fact3>36 brownies</fact3>, this is 36/12 = 3 dozen brownies. Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen is $1185 / 3 = $395.

Answer: A d4 die has four sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For <fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>:  There are three numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4). The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. To roll it twice in a row, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.  Expressed as a percentage, this is (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%.

For <fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>: There are two odd numbers on a d4 die (1 and 3). The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%.

The difference in likelihood is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points.

Therefore, it is 50 percentage points more likely that Gabriel rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.  The answer is {50}.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>7 less than two times the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the total number of students who enjoy dance, chess, swimming, and volleyball.  This is <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>32</fact5> = 58 students.

Next, we determine the number of students who like to play music.  The question states that this number is <fact6>7 less than two times the number of students who prefer playing volleyball</fact6>.  Since <fact5>32 students like to play volleyball</fact5>, the number of students who like music is (2 * 32) - 7 = 57 students.

Therefore, 50% of the students like to play video games.  The answer is {50}.

How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three?

Answer:

First, let's find Ravi's current age using <fact1>Ravi will be 47 in 8 years</fact1>.  His current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old.

Next, let's find Pavel's current age using <fact3>Ravi and Pavel are currently 22 years apart in age</fact3> and the fact that Ravi is younger than Pavel.  Pavel's current age is 39 + 22 = 61 years old.

Now, let's find Leilani's current age using <fact4>Ravi and Leilani are currently 10 years apart in age</fact4> and the fact that Ravi is older than Leilani. Leilani's current age is 39 - 10 = 29 years old.

To find the average age of all three, we add their ages together and divide by 3: (39 + 61 + 29) / 3 = 129 / 3 = 43 years old.

Finally, to determine how much younger Leilani is than the average age, we subtract Leilani's age from the average age: 43 - 29 = 14 years.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by <fact4>25% for the first half of the month</fact4>, and then by an <fact5>additional 50% for the second half</fact5>. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The uncle and spouse together eat <fact1>16</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2> = 32 pizzas per day.  The grandchild eats half of this, which is 32 / 2 = <fact3>16 pizzas per day</fact3>.  Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 32 + 16 = 48 pizzas per day.

Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 48 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 1440 pizzas in the first month.

In the second month, they reduce their consumption. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>25%</fact4>.  This means they eat 48 pizzas/day * 0.75 = 36 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas.

For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an <fact5>additional 50%</fact5> from the already reduced amount.  So they eat 36 pizzas/day * 0.5 = 18 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas.

Therefore, in the second month, they eat a total of 540 + 270 = 810 pizzas.

Over the two months, the family eats 1440 + 810 = 2250 pizzas.

From the rest, Sanjay can only respond to <fact3>2 less than the 1/2 of them</fact3>. How many emails does Sanjay respond to in a <fact4>4 day work week</fact4>? Sanjay works overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>20% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  <fact2>25% of 32 emails don't need a response</fact2>, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails.  This means 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many emails Sanjay responds to daily. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails that require a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Sanjay responds to during the first three days of the work week. For three days, he responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

On the last day, <fact5>Sanjay responds to 20% more emails than usual</fact5>.  This is an increase of 0.20 * 10 = 2 emails. So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails.

Finally, let's find the total number of emails responded to during the <fact4>4 day work week</fact4>. This is 30 emails (from the first three days) + 12 emails (from the last day) = 42 emails.

Therefore, Sanjay responds to 42 emails in a 4-day work week.  The answer is {42}.

Due to the pandemic, <fact4>20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of occupied rooms: <fact1>1700 rooms</fact1> * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 340 rooms.

Next, let's find the number of rooms out of service: <fact1>1700 rooms</fact1> * <fact3>1/5</fact3> = 340 rooms.

Now, let's determine the number of initially unoccupied rooms: <fact1>1700 rooms</fact1> - 340 rooms - 340 rooms = 1020 rooms.

Over <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> (<fact5>2 weeks</fact5> * 7 days/week = 14 days),  <fact4>20 patients</fact4> are admitted each day, resulting in a total of 14 days * <fact4>20 patients/day</fact4> = 280 additional patients.  This means 280 more rooms are occupied.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks is: 1020 rooms - 280 rooms = 740 rooms.

The answer is {740}.

The <fact2>first 5 have 100 apartments each</fact2>, and the <fact3>last one is 40% bigger than the other 5 combined</fact3>. However, <fact4>this week, 8 apartments from each of the first 5 complexes were vacant</fact4> and did not require collection service. <fact5>Hiroshi collects garbage 2 times a week from each place</fact5>, and he gets paid <fact6>₣0.25 per collection for each apartment</fact6>. He also earns an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>. How much money does he make in a week?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first five complexes.  According to <fact2>, each of the first five complexes has 100 apartments, so there are 5 * 100 = 500 apartments in total.

Next, let's find the number of apartments in the sixth complex.  The question states in <fact3> that the sixth complex is 40% bigger than the other five combined (500 apartments).  Therefore, the sixth complex has 500 + (0.40 * 500) = 700 apartments.

Now let's account for the vacant apartments.  <fact4> states that 8 apartments in each of the first 5 complexes were vacant. This means a total of 5 * 8 = 40 apartments did not require service.

This leaves a total of 500 + 700 - 40 = 1160 apartments requiring garbage collection.

<fact5> tells us Hiroshi collects garbage twice a week from each apartment. So he makes 1160 apartments * 2 collections/apartment = 2320 collections.

His base pay is 2320 collections * <fact6>₣0.25/collection</fact6> = ₣580.

Finally, he receives an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>, so his tip earnings are 0.10 * 580 = ₣58.

Therefore, his total weekly earnings are ₣580 + ₣58 = ₣638.  The answer is {638}.

If he watched <fact12>24 hours of TV in all</fact12>, how many <fact4>30-minute episodes</fact4> did he watch on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Sunday through Friday, excluding Tuesday.

* **Sunday and Monday:**  He watched 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV.
* **Wednesday:** He watched a 2-hour episode + a 1-hour episode = 3 hours of TV.
* **Thursday:** He watched 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours of TV.
* **Friday:** He watched 3 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 1.5 hours of TV.

Total TV time excluding Tuesday: 8 + 3 + 9 + 1.5 = 21.5 hours.

Since he watched a total of <fact12>24 hours of TV</fact12>, the time spent watching TV on Tuesday was 24 hours - 21.5 hours = 2.5 hours.  Each episode on Tuesday was <fact4>30 minutes</fact4> or 0.5 hours long. Therefore, he watched 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 5 episodes on Tuesday. The answer is {5}.

He paid registration fees that amounted to <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2> and also paid an agent fee that is <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3>. He also paid <fact4>$570,000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and <fact5>$15,000</fact5> for closing costs. Prof. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: First, we calculate the registration fees: <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$760,000</fact1> is 0.03 * $760,000 = $22,800.

Next, we calculate the agent fee: <fact3>4%</fact3> of <fact1>$760,000</fact1> is 0.04 * $760,000 = $30,400.

The total fees and costs paid by Prof. Miller are the registration fees ($22,800) + the agent fee ($30,400) + the remaining loan amount (<fact4>$570,000</fact4>) + closing costs (<fact5>$15,000</fact5>) = $638,200.

Prof. Miller's net proceeds from the sale are the selling price (<fact1>$760,000</fact1>) minus the total fees and costs ($638,200) which equals $121,800.

This amount ($121,800) was invested in stocks.  After the first year, the stocks gained 10%, so the value increased by 0.10 * $121,800 = $12,180. The value at the end of the first year is $121,800 + $12,180 = $133,980.

After the second year, the stocks gained another 10%, which is 0.10 * $133,980 = $13,398.  Therefore, Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years are $133,980 + $13,398 = $147,378.

Answer:

First, let's determine the number of questions in each subject.

* **Chemistry:** <fact2>40% of 100 questions</fact2> = 0.40 * 100 = 40 questions
* **Geography:** <fact3>20% of 100 questions</fact3> = 0.20 * 100 = 20 questions
* **History and Algebra:** The remaining questions are 100 - 40 - 20 = 40 questions.  Since these are equally divided, there are 40 / 2 = 20 questions in each subject.

Next, let's calculate how many questions Aisha is sure to answer correctly in each subject:

* **Chemistry:** Aisha is sure to get <fact5>100% of the 40 chemistry questions</fact5>, so she will get 1.00 * 40 = 40 questions correct.
* **Geography:** Aisha is sure to get <fact4>25% of the 20 geography questions</fact4>, so she will get 0.25 * 20 = 5 questions correct.
* **History and Algebra:** Aisha is sure to get <fact6>a tenth of the 20 history and 20 algebra questions</fact6>, meaning she'll get (1/10) * 20 + (1/10) * 20 = 4 questions correct in total from these two subjects (2 correct from each subject).


Finally, let's add up the number of questions Aisha is sure to answer correctly across all subjects: 40 + 5 + 4 = 49 questions.  Since each question is worth one point, Aisha is sure to get 49 points.

How much money does Valeria have left?

Answer: Let's break down Valeria's spending:

* **Cotton Candy:**  She bought 23 pounds. The sale is for 15 pounds at €21/pound, with an additional 5 pounds at a 1/3 discount (€21 * (1 - 1/3) = €14).  The cost of the first 15 pounds is 15 * €21 = €315.  The cost of the next 5 pounds (at a discount) is 5 * €14 = €70.  The cost of the remaining 3 pounds is 3 * €21 = €63. The total cost of the cotton candy is €315 + €70 + €63 = €448.

* **Coral:** The coral cost <fact5>€11.0</fact5>.

* **Pins:** The pins cost 11 * €21.0 = €231.

* **Charity:** Valeria donated <fact7>€5</fact7>.

Total spending: €448 + €11 + €231 + €5 = €695

Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to <fact6>cover a fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Leon still missing?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop per day:  <fact1>¥150 (hotel)</fact1> + <fact2>¥30 (food)</fact2> + <fact3>¥10 (transportation)</fact3> = ¥190 per day. For a 2-day workshop, the total cost is ¥190 * 2 = ¥380.

Next, we subtract the cost covered by Leon's friends.  Since his friends are covering all the food, we need to calculate the daily food cost and then the total food cost for the 2 days.  The daily food cost is <fact2>¥30</fact2>, so for two days this is ¥30 * 2 = ¥60.  The total cost is now ¥380 - ¥60 = ¥320.

Now we consider the youth club's contribution. The youth club covers a fifth (<fact6>a fifth</fact6>) of the remaining cost, which is ¥320 / 5 = ¥64.

Therefore, after the youth club's contribution, the amount Leon still needs to raise is ¥320 - ¥64 = ¥256.  Finally, we consider the money Leon already has (<fact4>¥155</fact4>).  The amount Leon is still missing is ¥256 - ¥155 = ¥101.

How many more ounces of breads does Carlos need to consume than Zahra?

Answer: First, let's calculate Carlos's calorie needs.  His healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. He has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, meaning his net calorie consumption is 900 - 150 = 750 calories. Therefore, he needs 3000 - 750 = 2250 more calories.

Next, let's calculate Zahra's calorie needs. Her healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>150 lbs</fact7> = 2250 calories. She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>225 calories</fact9> = 1125 calories.  Therefore, she needs 2250 - 1125 = 1125 more calories.

Now, let's figure out how many calories are in one ounce of bread.  A <fact2>300-ounce bag</fact2> has 5 servings, so each serving is 300/5 = 60 ounces.  Since each serving has <fact1>225 calories</fact1>, one ounce of bread contains 225/60 = 3.75 calories.

Carlos needs 2250 more calories, so he needs 2250 / 3.75 = 600 ounces of bread.  Zahra needs 1125 more calories, so she needs 1125 / 3.75 = 300 ounces of bread.

Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Carlos and Zahra need is 600 - 300 = 300 ounces.

Answer: Let's work backward from the final number of forks Valentina had.

* **Step 1: Account for guest forks:** The guests brought 2 packs * 8 forks/pack = 16 forks.  Subtract these from the final total: 49 - 16 = 33 forks.

* **Step 2: Account for used and defective forks:** Valentina used 6 forks and threw away 8 defective forks, meaning she lost 6 + 8 = 14 forks. Add these back to the total from Step 1: 33 + 14 = 47 forks.

* **Step 3: Account for husband's contribution:**  Her husband gave her 19 forks. Subtract these from the total from Step 2: 47 - 19 = 28 forks.

Therefore, the package Valentina bought initially contained 28 forks.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>3 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow</fact4>. How many potted plants will Sakura remain with?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Sakura had before receiving any new plants.  She had <fact2>7 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 420 plants</fact2>.

Next, let's account for the new plants. Two days ago, she received <fact1>49 new plants</fact1>, and yesterday, she bought <fact3>100 new plants</fact3>.

Answer:  The janitor initially takes <fact3>6 minutes</fact3> to clean a room, but due to the injury (<fact4>twice as long</fact4>), it now takes them 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes per room.  To clean all <fact1>80 rooms</fact1>, it will take them 12 minutes/room * 80 rooms = 960 minutes.

If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Fatima's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Due to her injury, her current speed on the beach is s/2.  Since she walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, her current speed on the beach is:

Speed_beach = Distance_beach / Time_beach = <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles/minute

Her original speed on the beach was therefore 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute.

According to <fact4>the problem</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk was three times her beach speed, which is 3 * 0.5 miles/minute = 1.5 miles/minute.  Due to the injury, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles/minute / 2 = 0.75 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is:

Time_sidewalk = Distance_sidewalk / Speed_sidewalk = <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes

Therefore, the total time to complete her walk is the sum of her time on the beach and her time on the sidewalk:

Note that Aisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel 120 clams.  Since she peels <fact1>10 clams per minute</fact1>, it will take her 120 clams / 10 clams/minute = 12 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we need to account for the clam washing time.  Washing each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4>, and there are 120 clams, so the total washing time is 120 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1680 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes.

The total time for peeling is the peeling time plus washing time: 12 minutes + 28 minutes = 40 minutes.

After peeling, Aisha takes a <fact5>7-minute break</fact5> before sautéing.

Now let's figure out the sautéing time.  Aisha sautés <fact2>30 clams in 6 minutes</fact2>, meaning her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 6 minutes = 5 clams per minute. To sauté <fact3>120 clams</fact3> will take 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes.

Finally, we add up all the times: 40 minutes (peeling and washing) + 7 minutes (break) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 71 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and sauté 120 clams. The answer is {71}.

Andre gives <fact6>1/10 of the made popcorn to his brother Jin</fact6>. How many more pieces of popcorn does Andre have to eat than his brother?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the popcorn popping in each 10-second interval:

* **Interval 1:** <fact1>80 kernels popped</fact1>.
* **Interval 2:** <fact2>4 * 80 = 320 kernels popped</fact2>.
* **Interval 3:** <fact3>6 * 80 = 480 kernels popped</fact3>.
* **Interval 4:** <fact4>480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped</fact4>.

After the pot is removed,  <fact5>240 / 4 = 60 kernels pop from residual heat</fact5>.

The total number of popped kernels is 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180.

Andre gives <fact6>1/10 of 1180 to Jin</fact6>, which is 1180 / 10 = 118 kernels.

Andre keeps 1180 - 118 = 1062 kernels.

The difference between the amount Andre eats and the amount Jin eats is 1062 - 118 = 944.

Therefore, Andre eats 944 more pieces of popcorn than his brother.  The answer is {944}.

Now, let's find Mia's current age. Mia is 10 years older than Qasim (<fact4>Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim</fact4>), making Mia 12 + 10 = 22 years old.

In 4 years, their ages will be:

* Diego: 21 + 4 = 25 years old
* Priya: 37 + 4 = 41 years old
* Qasim: 12 + 4 = 16 years old
* Mia: 22 + 4 = 26 years old

To find the average age in 4 years, we add their ages and divide by 4: (25 + 41 + 16 + 26) / 4 = 108 / 4 = 27 years old.

Therefore, the average age of all four in 4 years will be 27.

The answer is {27}

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

Answer: The question asks what percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits.  We are told in <fact3>that half of the 40 white animals were rabbits</fact3>.  Therefore, the number of rabbits is 40 / 2 = 20 rabbits. The information about the number of ants (<fact1>two-fourths as many ants as wasps</fact1>), grasshoppers (<fact4>36 grasshoppers</fact4>), and wasps (<fact5>16 wasps</fact5>) is irrelevant to determining the percentage of rabbits. The total number of white animals is given in <fact2>as 40</fact2>.  Since 20 out of 40 white animals are rabbits, the percentage of white animals that are rabbits is (20/40) * 100% = 50%.  Therefore, 50% of the white animals were rabbits.

During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, Chen and Tara compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Chen has <fact2>36 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Tara has <fact3>32 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>4 more weeks</fact4> of winter break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Chen and Tara have a combined total of <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> by the end of the <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> of winter break. This means they need to collect an additional 140 - 68 = 72 signatures.

During the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen's weekly collection is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures</fact6>.  Therefore, over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen will collect 4 weeks * (her current weekly rate - 5) signatures = an unknown number of signatures.  We don't know Chen's current weekly rate, but we can work out how many signatures Chen will add to her total:

Let's say Chen's current weekly average is 'x' signatures. Then her new weekly rate is (x-5) signatures. After 4 weeks she will have collected 4(x-5) signatures in total.

Tara needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal.  Let's say Tara collects 'y' signatures per week.  Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Tara will collect 4y signatures.

The total number of signatures collected by Chen and Tara in the remaining 4 weeks must equal 72.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4(x-5) + 4y = 72

We don't know 'x', but we know that over 5 weeks Chen collected 36 signatures. Therefore we can estimate x to be approximately 36/5 = 7.2. Thus 4(7.2-5) = 8.8


Solving for 'y' (Tara's weekly collection):

4(7.2 - 5) + 4y = 72
8.8 + 4y = 72
4y = 72 - 8.8
4y = 63.2
y = 15.8

Since Tara cannot collect parts of signatures, she needs to collect at least 16 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

Therefore, Tara will need to collect at least  {16} signatures per week.

Chen then donated <fact8>$5</fact8> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Chen have left?

Answer: Let's break down Chen's spending:

First, the taffy: She bought <fact4>23 kgs</fact4> of taffy.  The deal was <fact2>16 kgs at $22/kg</fact2>, so that's 16 kgs * $22/kg = $352.  The additional <fact4>23-16=7 kgs</fact4> received a <fact3>1/4 discount</fact3>, meaning each kg cost $22 - ($22 * 0.25) = $16.50.  The cost of those 7 kgs is 7 kgs * $16.50/kg = $115.50.  Her total taffy cost is $352 + $115.50 = $467.50.

Next, the starfish and keychains: The starfish cost <fact5>$11.0</fact5>, and the keychains cost <fact6>11</fact6> * <fact7>$21.0</fact7> = $231.

Finally, the donation: Chen donated <fact8>$5</fact8>.

Therefore, her total spending is $467.50 + $11 + $231 + $5 = $714.50.

Starting with <fact1>$1300</fact1>, she has $1300 - $714.50 = $585.50 left.

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact5>$11.0</fact5> and <fact6>18 pins that were $20.5 each</fact6>. Ava then donated <fact7>$5</fact7> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ava have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the cotton candy. Ava bought <fact4>23 pounds</fact4>.  The sale was for <fact2>17 pounds at $22 per pound</fact2>, which costs 17 * $22 = $374.  The discount on the extra <fact3>4 pounds</fact3> is (4 * $22) / 2 = $44. So the total cost of the cotton candy is $374 + (4*$22 - $44) = $374 + $44 = $418.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins: Ava bought <fact6>18 pins at $20.5 each</fact6>, costing 18 * $20.5 = $369.

Now let's add up all Ava's expenses:  The cotton candy cost $418, the coral cost <fact5>$11.0</fact5>, the pins cost $369, and the charity donation was <fact7>$5</fact7>.  Therefore, her total spending is $418 + $11 + $369 + $5 = $803.

Finally, to find out how much money Ava has left, we subtract her total spending from the amount her parents gave her: <fact1>$1400</fact1> - $803 = $597.

Therefore, Ava has $597 left. The answer is {597}.

Carlos work overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>75% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer:

First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  Since <fact2>25% of the 32 emails don't require a response</fact2>, that means 32 * 0.25 = 8 emails don't need a response.  Therefore, Carlos receives 32 - 8 = 24 emails that require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many of those emails Carlos can actually respond to.  <fact3>He responds to 4 less than half</fact3>, so he responds to (24 / 2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 emails daily.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Carlos responds to during a regular <fact4>4-day work week</fact4>.  That's 8 emails/day * 4 days = 32 emails.

Finally, let's account for the overtime on the last day. On that day, due to <fact5>responding to 75% more emails than usual</fact5>, Carlos responds to 8 emails * 1.75 = 14 emails.  Therefore, the total number of emails responded to during the work week is 32 (regular days) + 14 (overtime) = 46 emails.

Therefore, Carlos responds to 46 emails in his 4-day work week.

Benjamin has <fact2>720 crackers</fact2>, <fact3>9 bowls</fact3> and <fact4>3 plates</fact4>. Unfortunately, <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>. Benjamin then eats <fact6>one-eighth of all the crackers</fact6>. How many more bowls does Benjamin need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, let's determine the capacity of each plate.  Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers as a bowl (<fact1>21 crackers per bowl</fact1>), each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers.

Next, calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates before the breakage.  Benjamin has <fact3>9 bowls</fact3>, each holding <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, for a total of 9 * 21 = 189 crackers. He initially has <fact4>3 plates</fact4>, each holding 42 crackers, for a total of 3 * 42 = 126 crackers.  Combined, the bowls and plates could hold 189 + 126 = 315 crackers.

After <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>, the total capacity is reduced by 2 * 42 = 84 crackers. The new capacity is 315 - 84 = 231 crackers.

Benjamin starts with <fact2>720 crackers</fact2> and eats <fact6>one-eighth</fact6> of them, which is 720 / 8 = 90 crackers.  This leaves him with 720 - 90 = 630 crackers.

To determine how many more bowls are needed, we find out how many bowls would be required to hold all 630 remaining crackers.  Each bowl holds <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, so the number of bowls needed is 630 / 21 = 30 bowls.

Finally, subtract the number of bowls Benjamin already has (<fact3>9 bowls</fact3>) from the number of bowls needed (30 bowls): 30 - 9 = 21.  Therefore, Benjamin needs 21 more bowls.

If he watched <fact7>28 hours</fact7> of TV in all, how many <fact2>30-minute</fact2> episodes did he watch on Friday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Wednesday to Monday excluding Friday:

* **Wednesday:** 4 hours
* **Thursday:** 4 hours
* **Saturday:** 5 hours + (15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 5.25 hours
* **Sunday:** 4 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 12 hours
* **Monday:** 3 episodes * (45 minutes/episode / 60 minutes/hour) = 2.25 hours

Total time (excluding Friday): 4 + 4 + 5.25 + 12 + 2.25 = 27.5 hours

Now, subtract this from the total TV time for the week (<fact7>28 hours</fact7>): 28 hours - 27.5 hours = 0.5 hours.

This 0.5 hours is the time spent watching the 30-minute show on Friday.  Since each episode is <fact2>30 minutes</fact2> (or 0.5 hours), Faisal watched 0.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 1 episode on Friday. The answer is {1}.

Once they reach the mall for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late?

Answer:  The total time it takes to initially reach the mall is the sum of the time to reach the gym and the time to reach the mall from the gym: <fact2>24 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>27 minutes</fact3> = 51 minutes.

If the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

* **Apples:** <fact1>5 boxes * 7 pounds/box = 35 pounds</fact1>
* **Carrots:** <fact2>14 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 70 pounds</fact2>
* **Hay:** <fact3>35 packs * 44 pounds/pack = 1540 pounds</fact3>
* **Wheat:** <fact4>19 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 285 pounds</fact4>
* **Groceries:** <fact5>43 pounds</fact5>
* **Tools:** <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>
* **Wood:** <fact7>100 pounds</fact7>

Now, let's find the total weight of all the items: 35 + 70 + 1540 + 285 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 2100 pounds

Since each truck can carry <fact8>100 pounds</fact8>, the total number of trips needed with one truck would be 2100 pounds / 100 pounds/trip = 21 trips.

However, the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, so the number of trips per truck is 21 trips / 3 trucks = 7 trips per truck.

Therefore, the farmer needs a total of 21 trips to transport all the purchased items.  Each of the three trucks will make 7 trips.

If <fact6>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>32-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Emma walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 56 minutes.  Therefore, her speed on the beach *before* her injury was (14 kilometers / 56 minutes) = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or 0.25/2 = 0.125 kilometers per minute.

Emma walks 18 kilometers on the sidewalk. Before her injury, she walked three times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach (<fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4>), meaning her sidewalk speed was 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 kilometers per minute.  After her injury, her sidewalk speed is halved (<fact5>speed has decreased by half</fact5>), so it's now 0.75/2 = 0.375 kilometers per minute.


It takes her 18 kilometers / 0.375 kilometers/minute = 48 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants.  Aisha bought <fact1>24 croissants at $12 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 2 dozen croissants (24 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 2 dozen).  The cost of the croissants was 2 dozen * $12/dozen = $24.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Aisha bought <fact2>48 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, which means she bought 4 dozen macarons (48 macarons / 12 macarons/dozen = 4 dozen). The cost of the macarons was 4 dozen * $20/dozen = $80.

Now, let's find the pre-discount total cost. Before the discount, the total cost was the cost of the croissants plus the cost of the macarons plus the cost of the brownies (which we'll call 'x').  So, the pre-discount total was $24 + $80 + x.

Aisha received a <fact4>20% discount</fact4> and paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price was $1520.  We can set up an equation: 0.80 * ($24 + $80 + x) = $1520.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.80 * (104 + x) = 1520.  Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get: 104 + x = 1900.  Subtracting 104 from both sides, we find x = $1800.  Therefore, the total cost of the brownies was $1800.

Finally, since Aisha bought <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>, which is 2 dozen (24 brownies / 12 brownies/dozen = 2 dozen), the cost per dozen brownies was $1800 / 2 dozen = $900 per dozen.

Answer: First, let's calculate Theo's and Sakura's calorie needs.  Theo's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact4>250 lbs</fact4> = 3750 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 150 = 950 calories. Therefore, Theo needs 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.  Sakura's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.  She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 1075 calories. Thus, Sakura needs 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Next, let's determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies.  Each serving contains <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a <fact2>125 oz bag</fact2> has 5 servings.  Therefore, one ounce of cookies contains 175 calories / 5 servings / (125 oz / 5 servings) = 2.8 calories/oz.

Finally, let's find the difference in the amount of cookies needed. Theo needs 1000 oz - 312.5 oz = 687.5 more ounces of cookies than Sakura.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half <fact5>both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Olivia walks 13 miles on the beach and it takes her 65 minutes.  Therefore, her speed on the beach before her injury was 13 miles / 65 minutes = 0.2 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that,  0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute <fact5>(speed decreased by half on the beach)</fact5>.

Since she walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk as on the beach <fact4>(four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk)</fact4>, her sidewalk speed before the injury was 4 * 0.2 miles/minute = 0.8 miles/minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is half that: 0.8 miles/minute / 2 = 0.4 miles/minute <fact5>(speed decreased by half on the sidewalk)</fact5>.

Now we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk.  Olivia walks 16 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.4 miles/minute. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 40 minutes.

Finally, to find the total time for the walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 65 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 105 minutes.

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

Answer: The question asks for the percentage of animals that were rabbits.  We are given that Valeria found <fact2>18 white animals</fact2>, and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>. This means there were 18/2 = 9 rabbits.

The total number of animals mentioned is the sum of the rabbits, caterpillars, and beetles.  We have 9 rabbits + <fact4>30 caterpillars</fact4> + <fact5>15 beetles</fact5> = 54 animals.

The percentage of animals that were rabbits is (9 rabbits / 54 total animals) * 100% = 16.67%.  Rounding to the nearest whole number, approximately 17% of the animals in the patch were rabbits.  Note that the information about the ratio of ants to beetles (<fact1>4/5 as many ants as beetles</fact1>) is irrelevant to determining the percentage of rabbits.

Answer:  A four-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Let's analyze the probabilities:

* **Fact 2: Rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:** The numbers greater than 2 on the <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> are 3 and 4.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25% or 0.25.

* **Fact 3: Rolling four even numbers in a row:** The only even number on the <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> is 2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number (a 2) on a single roll is 1/4 = 25%. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256 ≈ 0.39% or 0.0039.

To find the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:

25% - 0.39% = 24.61%

Therefore, Tariq is 24.61 percentage points more likely to roll a number greater than 2 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.

The answer is {24.61}.

During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures.

Uma has <fact2>29 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Zahra has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>.

However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Zahra decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Uma and Zahra have a combined total of <fact2>29</fact2> + <fact3>37</fact3> = 66 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>130 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 130 - 66 = 64 signatures in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Uma's collection rate will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6> due to collecting only on weekends. Over <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, this means she will collect 4 * (her current average - 5) signatures.  We don't know Uma's current average weekly collection rate, but it can be calculated by dividing the number of signatures she has by the number of weeks: 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. So she will collect approximately 4 * (4.83 - 5) = -0.68 signatures (we can round this to 0 because you can't collect a negative number of signatures).

Therefore, Zahra needs to collect the remaining 64 signatures herself, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.  To achieve this, she will need to collect 64 / <fact4>4</fact4> = 16 signatures per week.

On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total length of remoras on the first dolphin.  Initially, there were <fact2>24 remoras</fact2>, each <fact3>18 inches long</fact3>, totaling 24 * 18 = 432 inches.  After a <fact4>third swam away</fact4>, 24/3 = 8 remoras left, representing a total length of 8 * 18 = 144 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the 144 inches is equivalent to 144/12 = 12 feet.

The percentage of the <fact1>48-foot dolphin's</fact1> body length covered by remoras is (12 feet / 48 feet) * 100% = 25%.

Next, let's consider the second dolphin. It had <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches long</fact7>, totaling 6 * 8 = 48 inches.  This is equivalent to 48/12 = 4 feet.

The percentage of the <fact5>10-foot dolphin's</fact5> body length covered by remoras is (4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 40%) / 2 = 32.5%.

Therefore, on average, 32.5% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.  The answer is {32.5}.

The store offers a <fact12>10% discount on paint for members</fact12>, and Liam is a member. How much more money does Valentina have left than Liam after they leave the store?

Answer: Let's calculate Valentina's expenses first.

* **Screws:** <fact2>17 screws</fact2> * <fact3>¥0.3/screw</fact3> = ¥5.10
* **Washers:** <fact4>9 washers</fact4> * <fact5>¥0.59/washer</fact5> = ¥5.31
* **Paint:**  The cost of Valentina's paint is 8 gallons * the price per gallon (which is not given but is irrelevant since we only need the final amount).

Valentina's total spending is ¥5.10 + ¥5.31 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint) =  ¥10.41 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint).  We don't need to know the exact price per gallon of paint since it will subtract equally from both total amounts.


Now let's calculate Liam's expenses.

* **Paint:** <fact8>10 gallons</fact8> * <fact9>¥8.0/gallon</fact9> = ¥80.00.  With a <fact12>10% discount</fact12>, Liam pays ¥80.00 * 0.90 = ¥72.00
* **Pencils:** <fact10>3 pencils</fact10> * <fact11>¥2/pencil</fact11> = ¥6.00

Liam's total spending is ¥72.00 + ¥6.00 = ¥78.00

To find the difference in remaining money, we calculate:

Valentina's remaining money: <fact1>¥99.41</fact1> - ¥10.41 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)  = ¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)
Liam's remaining money: <fact7>¥90</fact7> - ¥78.00 = ¥12.00

The difference is (¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)) - ¥12.00 = ¥77 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint).  As long as the price per gallon for paint is the same for both, the cost of paint cancels out, and Valentina has ¥77 more left than Liam.


Therefore, Valentina has ¥77 more money left than Liam after they leave the store. Note that we don't need the price per gallon of paint to solve this problem.

If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Before her injury, her sidewalk speed was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, or 2s. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now s/2, and her speed on the sidewalk is now 2s/2 = s.

We know she spends <fact5>51 minutes on the beach</fact5> and covers <fact2>17 miles</fact2>. Therefore, her current beach speed is 17 miles / 51 minutes = 1/3 mile per minute.

Since her sidewalk speed is the same as her original speed on the beach, her current sidewalk speed is also 1/3 mile per minute.  The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance on the sidewalk (<fact3>16 miles</fact3>) divided by her sidewalk speed (1/3 mile/minute), which is 16 miles / (1/3 mile/minute) = 48 minutes.

Answer:  We know Rania walks <fact2>14 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and it takes her <fact5>42 minutes</fact5>.  This means her speed on the beach, before her injury, would have been 14 km / 42 min = 1/3 km/min. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or (1/3)/2 = 1/6 km/min.  Therefore, her current walking time on the beach remains 42 minutes.

Rania walks <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Before her injury, her speed on the sidewalk was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, so it would have been 2 * (1/3 km/min) = 2/3 km/min.  After her injury, her sidewalk speed is half of that, or (2/3)/2 = 1/3 km/min.

To find her current sidewalk walking time, we divide the distance by her reduced speed: 14 km / (1/3 km/min) = 42 minutes.

Answer: 
A <fact1>d4 die</fact1> has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For the first scenario (<fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>):
* The numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, and 4.  So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4.
* The probability of this happening twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

For the second scenario (<fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>):
* The odd numbers on a d4 are 1 and 3. So there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2.
* The probability of this happening four times in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

To express the difference in percentage points, we convert the probabilities to percentages:
* Probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row: (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%
* Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%

Thiago has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact7>1/4 of the remaining cost</fact7> of the science fair. How much money is Thiago still missing?

Answer: The total cost per day is <fact2>$250</fact2> + <fact3>$30</fact3> + <fact4>$30</fact4> = $310.  Since the science fair is <fact1>3 days</fact1> long, the total cost is $310 * <fact1>3</fact1> = $930.  <fact6>Thiago's friends are covering the cost of food</fact6>, which is <fact3>$30</fact3> per day * <fact1>3</fact1> days = $90.

Answer: For each grandchild, Fatima needs <fact7>4</fact7> + <fact8>6</fact8> + <fact9>8</fact9> + <fact10>12</fact10> + <fact11>10</fact11> = 40 skeins of wool.

**Answer:**

Amelia eats <fact3>twice</fact3> as much as Aisha, so Amelia eats <fact2>3</fact2> * 2 = 6 servings a day.  Ava eats <fact4>four times</fact4> as much as Amelia, so Ava eats 6 * 4 = 24 servings a day.

In the <fact5>first 2 days</fact5>, Aisha eats <fact2>3</fact2> servings/day * <fact5>2</fact5> days = 6 servings. Amelia eats 6 servings/day * <fact5>2</fact5> days = 12 servings. Ava eats 24 servings/day * <fact5>2</fact5> days = 48 servings.

Sanjay <fact5>work overtime on the last day</fact5> so he can respond to <fact6>20% more emails than usual</fact6>.


**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many emails Sanjay receives that *do* require a response each day. Since <fact2>25% don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - 25% = 75% *do* require a response.  So, he needs to respond to 0.75 * <fact1>32 emails</fact1> = 24 emails.

Next, we find out how many of those emails he *can* respond to. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails requiring responses, which is (24 / 2) - <fact3>2</fact3> = 10 emails per day.

For the first three days of his <fact4>four-day work week</fact4>, Sanjay responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

On the last day (<fact5>due to overtime</fact5>), Sanjay responds to <fact6>20% more</fact6> than usual.  This means he responds to an additional 0.20 * 10 emails = 2 emails.  So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails.

5. **Pizzas per day (second half of <fact5>second month</fact5>):**
    * Additional reduction of <fact8>50%</fact8> from the reduced amount: 36 pizzas * (1 - 0.50) = 18 pizzas/day

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount</fact5> on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

**Answer:**

1. **Discounted Price:** With a <fact5>20% discount</fact5>, the selling price of the house becomes <fact2>$500,000</fact2> * (1 - 0.20) = $400,000.

2. **Brokerage Fee:** The brokerage fee is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.07 = $28,000.

3. **Transfer Fee:** The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.12 = $48,000.

**Answer:**

Chen started with <fact1>$1300</fact1>.

She bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of taffy. The first 16 kgs cost <fact2>$22/kg</fact2>, so that's 16 * <fact2>$22</fact2> = $352.

The last remaining 1 kg of the 7kg was at normal price and it cost <fact2>$22</fact2> * 1 = $22. Her total taffy cost was $352 + $99 + $22 = $473.

She also spent <fact4>$11</fact4> on starfish and <fact5>11</fact5> * <fact6>$21</fact6> = $231 on keychains.

She used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

**Answer:**

Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (51:5)</fact1>, we have s/w = 51/5.
From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (7 tablespoons milk : 5 cups water)</fact2>, we have m/w = 7/5.
From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons cream : 1 teaspoon sugar)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1 or c = 2s.

We are given that the total quantity of ingredients is <fact4>220</fact4>:  s + w + m + c = 220.

We can express w, m, and c in terms of s:

* w = (5/51)s
* m = (7/5)w = (7/5) * (5/51)s = (7/51)s
* c = 2s

Now substitute these into the total quantity equation:

s + (5/51)s + (7/51)s + 2s = 220

Combine the terms with 's':

(1 + 5/51 + 7/51 + 2)s = 220
(3 + 12/51)s = 220
(3 + 4/17)s = 220
(55/17)s = 220

Now, solve for s:

s = (220 * 17) / 55
s = (4 * 17)
s = 68

Therefore, Olivia used 68 teaspoons of sugar.  The answer is {68}.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at <fact4>three times</fact4> the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, <fact5>Emma's speed has decreased by half</fact5> both on the beach and sidewalk. If <fact6>56 minutes</fact6> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Before the injury, Emma walked 14 kilometers on the beach in some amount of time *t*.  Since her speed is halved after the injury (<fact5>), she now takes twice as long, 2*t, to walk the same distance on the beach (<fact2>). We are told this time is <fact6>56 minutes</fact6>. So, 2*t = <fact6>56 minutes</fact6>, which means t = 28 minutes. This was her time on the beach *before* the injury.

Her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was three times her speed on the beach (<fact4>).  So, if it took her 28 minutes to walk the 14 km on the beach, it would have taken her 28 / 3 = 9.33 minutes to walk 14 km on the sidewalk at that faster pace (before the injury).

Since the sidewalk portion of her walk is 18 km (<fact3>), not 14 km, we can set up a proportion to find the pre-injury sidewalk time:

(9.33 minutes / 14 km) = (x minutes / 18 km)

Solving for x, we get approximately 12 minutes. This was her sidewalk time before the injury.

After the injury, her speed was halved on *both* the beach and the sidewalk (<fact5>). So, her beach time is now 28 minutes * 2 = 56 minutes (as given - <fact6>).  Her sidewalk time is now 12 minutes * 2 = 24 minutes.

Therefore, her total walking time after the injury is 56 minutes + 24 minutes = 80 minutes. The answer is {80}.

**Answer:**

1. **Giant cubes:** Luca used <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>14 ounces/cube</fact2> = 126 ounces of water.

2. **Medium cubes:** He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>3 ounces/cube</fact3> = 36 ounces of water.

3. **Small cubes:** He used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>0.5 ounces/cube</fact4> = 7 ounces of water.

4. **Tiny cubes:**  Since he made a total of <fact6>47 ice cubes</fact6>, and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes (<fact7>9</fact7> + <fact9>12</fact9> + <fact8>14</fact8> = 35 cubes), there must be <fact6>47</fact6> - 35 = 12 tiny cubes.  Tiny cubes use <fact5>half the water of small cubes</fact5>, so each tiny cube uses <fact4>0.5 ounces</fact4> / 2 = 0.25 ounces.  Therefore, he used 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces of water.

6. **Water remaining:** Luca started with <fact1>337 ounces</fact1> and used 172 ounces, so he has <fact1>337</fact1> - 172 = 165 ounces of water left.

However, this week, <fact4>5 apartments from each of the first 4 complexes were vacant</fact4> and did not require collection service. <fact5>Qasim collects garbage 2 times a week from each place</fact5> and he <fact6>gets paid ₣0.3 per collection for each apartment</fact6>. He also <fact7>earns an additional 10% in tips</fact7>. <fact8>How much money does he make in a week?</fact8>


**Answer:**

1. **Apartments in the last complex:** The first 4 complexes have a total of <fact2>4 * 100 = 400 apartments</fact2>. The last complex is <fact3>30% bigger</fact3>, meaning it has 400 * 0.30 = 120 more apartments than the combined total of the others.  So, the last complex has 400 + 120 = 520 apartments.

2. **Total apartments served this week:**  <fact4>5 apartments were vacant in each of the first 4 complexes</fact4>, for a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vacant apartments.  This means Qasim collected from 400 - 20 = 380 apartments in the first four complexes. Adding the last complex, he served a total of 380 + 520 = 900 apartments this week.

3. **Collections per week:** Qasim collects from each apartment <fact5>twice a week</fact5>, so he makes 900 * 2 = 1800 collections per week.

4. **Base earnings:**  Qasim earns <fact6>₣0.3 per collection</fact6>, so his base earnings are 1800 * ₣0.3 = ₣540.

5. **Tips:** Qasim earns an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>, which is ₣540 * 0.10 = ₣54.

6. **Total earnings:** Qasim's total earnings for the week are <fact8>₣540 (base pay) + ₣54 (tips) = ₣594</fact8>.

**Answer:**

Since <fact3>Ravi</fact3> <fact6>will be 47 in 8 years</fact6>, his current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old.

<fact5>Leilani is younger than Ravi</fact5> and they are <fact2>10 years apart</fact2>, so Leilani is currently 39 - 10 = 29 years old.

Bodhi also decides to buy himself <fact6>a cookie for $1</fact6>. How much does Bodhi have to pay?


Answer: Bodhi uses <fact4>2 pounds of rice per day</fact4>, so for <fact3>a week (7 days)</fact3>, he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of rice.  The more expensive rice costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the <fact1>$15 per pound</fact1> normal brand. So, the expensive rice costs 15 * 1.20 = $18 per pound.

**Answer:**

1. **Soccer Players Going:** There are <fact1>100 students</fact1> total, and <fact2>46% are soccer players</fact2>, meaning there are 100 * 0.46 = 46 soccer players. However, <fact7>half of them are sick</fact7>, so 46 / 2 = 23 soccer players are going to the competition.

2. **Remaining Students:**  If 46 students are soccer players, then <fact3>the remaining class</fact3> has 100 - 46 = 54 students.

3. **Robotics/Dancers Going:** <fact4>50% of the remaining students</fact4> are robotics club members or dancers, so 54 * 0.50 = 27 students from these groups are going.

**Answer:**

Gabrielle saw <fact5>15 bees</fact5>.  She saw <fact1>two-fifths as many wasps</fact1>, which means she saw (2/5) * <fact5>15</fact5> = 6 wasps.

She saw <fact3>half as many rabbits as white animals</fact3>, and there were <fact2>38 white animals</fact2>. So, she saw <fact2>38</fact2> / 2 = 19 rabbits.

The total number of animals is the sum of wasps, bees, rabbits, and caterpillars: 6 + <fact5>15</fact5> + 19 + <fact4>41</fact4> = 81 animals.

However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Chen's weekly collection rate during the first <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>.  She collected a total of <fact2>36 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, meaning she averaged <fact2>36</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 7.2 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate how many signatures Chen will collect in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her collection rate is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so she will now collect 7.2 - <fact6>5</fact6> = 2.2 signatures per week. Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, she'll collect 2.2 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 8.8 signatures.  Since signatures must be whole numbers, we round this down to 8 signatures.

Now, let's determine how many signatures they have in total so far.  <fact2>Chen has 36</fact2> and <fact3>Tara has 32</fact3>, totaling <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.

Adding Chen's expected 8 additional signatures from the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, they will have 68 + 8 = 76 signatures.

They want to reach <fact5>140 signatures total</fact5>.  This means Tara needs to collect the remaining <fact5>140</fact5> - 76 = 64 signatures.

Finally, since Tara has <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> left, she needs to collect 64 / <fact4>4</fact4> = 16 signatures per week to meet their goal.

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the space each plant needs:** Each plant requires <fact2>3 meters</fact2> (for its width) plus <fact3>15 meters</fact3> of space between it and the next plant, totaling 3 + 15 = 18 meters.

Due to the natural disaster, <fact4>30 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact4>. Calculate the <question>total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 3 weeks</question>.

**Answer:**

1. **Initial unoccupied rooms:** The clinic has a capacity of <fact1>1600 rooms</fact1>.  <fact2>One-tenth (1/10)</fact2> are occupied, meaning 1600 * (1/10) = 160 rooms are occupied.  <fact3>Two-fifths (2/5)</fact3> are out of service, meaning 1600 * (2/5) = 640 rooms are out of service. Initially, the number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>1600</fact1> - 160 - 640 = 800.

2. **Rooms occupied after 3 weeks:**  There are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.  <fact4>30 patients</fact4> are admitted each day, so 21 days * <fact4>30 patients/day</fact4> = 630 new patients are admitted.

3. **Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:** We assume each patient occupies one room.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer:
Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (48:10)</fact1>, we have s/w = 48/10. This simplifies to w = (10/48)s = (5/24)s.

From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (6 tablespoons for every 10 cups)</fact2>, we have m/w = 6/10. This means m = (3/5)w. Substituting the expression for 'w' in terms of 's', we get m = (3/5)*(5/24)s = (1/8)s.

From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1. So, c = 2s.

We are given that <fact4>the total quantity of ingredients used is 210</fact4>. Therefore, s + w + m + c = 210. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get:

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks <fact1>(unknown number of forks)</fact1>. Later, her husband also bought a package of <fact2>9 new forks</fact2> and gave them to Chen. While Chen was making the beef stew, she <fact3>used sixteen of the forks to sample</fact3> her beef stew, then <fact4>threw away 12 defective forks</fact4>.

How many forks were in the package that Chen bought?

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the number of forks in the package Chen initially bought <fact1>.  

Here's how we can calculate the total number of forks Chen had before setting the table:

* **Chen's forks:** x
* **Husband's forks:** <fact2>+ 9</fact2>
* **Guests' forks:** <fact5>+ 2 * 12 = + 24</fact5>
* **Forks used for sampling:** <fact3>- 16</fact3>
* **Defective forks discarded:** <fact4>- 12</fact4>

This can be expressed as an equation: x + 9 + 24 - 16 - 12 = <fact6>32</fact6>

Simplifying the equation: x + 15 = 32

Solving for x: x = 32 - 15 = 17

Therefore, there were 17 forks in the package that Chen bought <fact1>. The answer is {17}.

Mei's flowers grow <fact2>4 meters wide</fact2> so she needs to leave <fact3>12 meters</fact3> between every plant (including the plants width). Mei already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>.

How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?


Answer:
Each plant and its required spacing will take up <fact2>4 meters</fact2> (the plant's width) + <fact3>12 meters</fact3> (the spacing) = 16 meters of the flower bed's length.

The flower bed is <fact1>120 meters long</fact1>.  Therefore, the flower bed can hold <fact1>120 meters</fact1> / 16 meters/plant = 7.5 plants. Since Mei can only have whole plants, she can fit a maximum of 7 plants.

Mei already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. She needs 7 plants total, so she needs to buy 7 - <fact4>6</fact4> = 1 plant.

Since she is buying only 1 plant, she won't qualify for the <fact7>$5 discount</fact7> (which applies only if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>).

Therefore, Mei will spend <fact5>$5</fact5>/plant * 1 plant = $5 at the store.

If the city is <fact4>72 miles</fact4> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact5>1/4</fact5> of the city?


**Answer:**

The fog bank covers <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in <fact1>75 minutes</fact1>.  This means it covers 1 mile in <fact1>75</fact1>/<fact2>10</fact2> = 7.5 minutes.

We want to know how long it takes to cover <fact5>1/4</fact5> of the city. The city is <fact4>72 miles</fact4> across, so <fact5>1/4</fact5> of the city is (<fact5>1/4</fact5>) * <fact4>72</fact4> = 18 miles.

The problem mentions a change in wind speed after <fact3>one hour (60 minutes)</fact3>.  However, since we are calculating the time to cover only 18 miles, and at the initial speed the fog covers 10 miles in 75 minutes (which is more than an hour), the change in wind speed is irrelevant for this part of the question.  The change would only be a factor if we were calculating a time greater than 75 minutes since it takes longer than an hour to reach the first 10 miles.

Therefore, to cover 18 miles, it will take 18 miles * 7.5 minutes/mile = 135 minutes. The answer is {135}.

Answer:
The space each plant will occupy in the flower bed is the width of the plant (<fact2>3 meters</fact2>) plus the space between plants (<fact3>13 meters</fact3>), which is 3 + 13 = 16 meters.

The flower bed is <fact1>117 meters long</fact1>, so it can hold 117 / 16 = 7 plants with some space left over (5 meters, which isn't enough for another plant).

Haruka already has <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. Since she can fit 7 plants and needs 1 more, she only needs to buy 7 - 6 = 1 plant from the store.

Also, <fact8>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact8>. <fact9>How many students are leaving early to the competition?</fact9>


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the number of soccer players in the class: <fact1>150 students</fact1> * <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60 soccer players.  However, <fact7>half of these soccer players are absent</fact7>, so 60 / 2 = 30 soccer players are going to the competition.

Next, we determine the number of students who are not soccer players: <fact1>150 students</fact1> - 60 soccer players = 90 students.  Of these <fact3>remaining students</fact3>, <fact4>30% are dancers or choir members</fact4>: 90 students * <fact4>30%</fact4> = 27 dancers/choir members.

So, the total number of students from the <fact5>three groups</fact5> (<fact6>leaving early for the competition</fact6>) is 30 soccer players + 27 dancers/choir members = 57 students.

Finally, we add the cheerleaders:  <fact5>3 groups</fact5> * <fact8>3 cheerleaders/group</fact8> = 9 cheerleaders.

Therefore, the total number of people <fact6>leaving early for the competition</fact6> is 57 students + 9 cheerleaders = 66 people. Since the question asks for the number of *students* leaving early, the answer is 57.

How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

**Answer:**

Theo's daily calorie target is <fact5>250 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3750 calories.  He has a net calorie consumption of <fact6>1100 calories</fact6> - <fact7>150 calories</fact7> = 950 calories. This means he can still consume 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.

Sakura's daily calorie target is <fact8>130 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 1950 calories. She has consumed <fact9>900 calories</fact9> + <fact10>175 calories</fact10> = 1075 calories. This means she can still consume 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Each serving of cookies has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a bag contains <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, totaling 175 * 5 = 875 calories per bag.  Since a bag is <fact2>125 oz</fact2>, each serving is 125 oz / 5 servings = 25 oz.

Theo can consume 2800 more calories, so he can eat 2800 calories / 175 calories/serving = 16 servings of cookies. This translates to 16 servings * 25 oz/serving = 400 oz of cookies.  Since a bag is 125 oz, this is more cookies than we have information for.  So we focus on how much he *can* eat from what is available: 125 oz.

Sakura can consume 875 more calories, which is exactly the number of calories in a <fact2>125 oz</fact2> bag of cookies (<fact3>5 servings</fact3> at <fact1>175 calories/serving</fact1>). Therefore, Sakura can eat 125 oz of cookies.

The difference in the amount of cookies they can consume is 125 oz (Theo) - 125 oz (Sakura) = 0 oz.


Thus, from the available bag of cookies, Theo can consume exactly the same amount as Sakura can, so Theo needs to consume 0 more oz of cookies than Sakura. The answer is {0}.

After <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, <fact2>Mei has 24 signatures</fact2> in her book, and <fact3>Haruka has 51</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>3 more weeks</fact4> of summer break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures between them</fact5> by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, Mei is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Haruka decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Haruka need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Mei's current collection rate.  She collected <fact2>24 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, so her current rate is 24 / <fact1>5</fact1> = 4.8 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate Mei's reduced collection rate.  Due to only collecting signatures on weekends, her rate decreases by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so her new rate will be 4.8 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.2 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we assume she collects 0 signatures during these weeks.

Now, let's determine how many signatures Mei will collect in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  At her reduced collection rate, she collects 0 signatures/week * <fact4>3 weeks</fact4> = 0 signatures. 

We know they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> total. They currently have <fact2>24</fact2> (Mei) + <fact3>51</fact3> (Haruka) = 75 signatures. So, they need <fact5>135</fact5> - 75 = 60 more signatures.

Since Mei will collect 0 additional signatures, Haruka needs to collect all the remaining 60 signatures in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  Therefore, Haruka needs to collect 60 / <fact4>3</fact4> = 20 signatures per week.

How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Uma's average weekly signature collection rate during the first <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>. She collected <fact2>29 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>, meaning she collected 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week.

Next, we determine how many signatures Uma will collect during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Due to her reduced collection ability, she will collect 4.83 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.17 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we can assume she collects 0 signatures in the last <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her total collected will remain at <fact2>29</fact2>.

Now we calculate how many signatures Zahra needs to collect in total.  Together they want <fact5>130</fact5> signatures, and Uma will have <fact2>29</fact2>, so Zahra needs to collect 130 - 29 = 101 signatures in total.

Finally, we figure out Zahra's required weekly collection rate.  She already has <fact3>37</fact3> signatures, so she needs to collect an additional 101 - 37 = 64 signatures over the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. This means she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

Ava recently bought <fact7>a tube of bouncy balls</fact7>, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to <fact8>350</fact8>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>44 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>7 stuffed animals</fact2> = 51 items. 
Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. So, there are 2 * 51 = 102 action figures.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the markers is <fact1>8 markers</fact1> * $7.75 = $62. The total cost of the folders is <fact2>12 folders</fact2> * $13 = $156. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$14</fact3>. The total cost of the pencils is <fact4>8 pencils</fact4> * $11 = $88. So, the total cost without any discount is $62 + $156 + $14 + $88 = $320.

If Sanjay becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time $20 fee</fact5>. The total discount will be 20% of $320, which is 0.2 * $320 = $64. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $320 - $64 + $20 = $276.

If Sanjay does not become a member, he will get <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be 5% of $320, which is 0.05 * $320 = $16. So, the total cost without the membership discount is $320 - $16 = $304.

Since $276 is less than $304, the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything is $276.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items James bought. The cost of the notebooks is <fact1>6 notebooks</fact1> * ¥7.0 = ¥42. The cost of the pencils is <fact2>14 pencils</fact2> * ¥10.0 = ¥140. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>¥24</fact3>. The cost of the markers is <fact4>6 markers</fact4> * ¥9 = ¥54.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the markers is <fact1>24</fact1> * €<fact1>4.0</fact1> = €96. The cost of the rulers is <fact2>4</fact2> * €<fact2>13.5</fact2> = €54. The cost of the ream of bond paper is €<fact3>13</fact3>. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact4>7</fact4> * €<fact4>11</fact4> = €77. So, the total cost without any discount is €96 + €54 + €13 + €77 = €240.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €240, which is €240 * 0.05 = €12. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €240 - €12 = €228.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time €20 fee. The discount amount is 20% of €240, which is €240 * 0.20 = €48. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €240 - €48 = €192. Adding the one-time €20 fee, the total cost is €192 + €20 = €212.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Ali can spend on everything is €212, which is the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time €20 fee.

After <fact4>30 minutes from the start of the call</fact4>, the price drops even more to <fact5>$0.1 per two minutes</fact5>. If your total bill is more than <fact6>$15</fact6>, you get a <fact7>15% discount on your total bill</fact7>. How much would a <fact8>90-minute call</fact8> cost?

Answer: The call can be divided into three parts: the first <fact2>10 minutes</fact2>, the next <fact4>30-10=20 minutes</fact4>, and the last <fact8>90</fact8>-<fact4>30</fact4>=60 minutes. 
For the first <fact2>10 minutes</fact2>, the cost is <fact1>$0.9 per minute</fact1> * <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> = $9. 
For the next <fact4>20 minutes</fact4>, the cost is <fact3>$0.4 per minute</fact3> * <fact4>20 minutes</fact4> = $8. 
For the last <fact8>60 minutes</fact8>, since the price is <fact5>$0.1 per two minutes</fact5>, we need to divide the time by 2 to get the number of 2-minute intervals, which is <fact8>60</fact8>/2 = 30 intervals. The cost for this part is <fact5>$0.1 per two minutes</fact5> * 30 intervals = $3. 
The total cost before discount is $9 + $8 + $3 = $20. 
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>$15</fact6>, we get a <fact7>15% discount on the total bill</fact7>, which is $20 * 0.15 = $3.

He bought <fact1>20 erasers which cost €2.25 each</fact1>, <fact2>8 colored pencils which cost €14.25 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost €21</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>5 crayons which cost €8 each</fact4>. Diego can either pay a <fact5>one-time €20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive only a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Diego can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of erasers is <fact1>20 erasers</fact1> * €2.25 = €45. The total cost of colored pencils is <fact2>8 colored pencils</fact2> * €14.25 = €114. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€21</fact3>. The total cost of crayons is <fact4>5 crayons</fact4> * €8 = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €45 + €114 + €21 + €40 = €220.

If Diego becomes a member and pays the <fact5>one-time €20 fee</fact5>, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>. The total discount will be €220 * 0.20 = €44. So, the total cost with the membership discount is €220 - €44 = €176. Adding the <fact5>one-time €20 fee</fact5>, the total cost with membership is €176 + €20 = €196.

If Diego does not become a member, he will receive only a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be €220 * 0.05 = €11. So, the total cost without membership is €220 - €11 = €209.

Therefore, the least amount Diego can spend on everything is €196, which is the total cost with the membership discount.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since <fact2>a quarter of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>240</fact1> * 1/4 = 60. The rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>240</fact1> - 60 = 180 golf balls.

Next, we need to find out how many blue tennis balls are marked. Since <fact3>1/6 of the tennis balls are blue</fact3>, the number of blue tennis balls is 60 * 1/6 = 10. And since <fact4>a tenth of those blue tennis balls are marked</fact4>, the number of marked blue tennis balls is 10 * 1/10 = 1.

Now, we need to find out how many gray golf balls are marked. Since <fact5>1/2 of the golf balls are gray</fact5>, the number of gray golf balls is 180 * 1/2 = 90. And since all except <fact6>1/6 of those gray balls are marked</fact6>, the number of marked gray golf balls is 90 - 90 * 1/6 = 90 - 15 = 75.

Finally, we add the number of marked blue tennis balls and marked gray golf balls to get the total number of marked balls: 1 + 75 = 76.

Answer: To calculate the cost of the call, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 15 minutes, the next 20 minutes, and the remaining 70 minutes. 
The first <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> cost <fact1>€0.8 per minute</fact1>, so the total cost for this part is <fact1>€0.8</fact1> * <fact2>15</fact2> = €12.
The next 20 minutes cost <fact3>€0.7 per minute</fact3>, so the total cost for this part is <fact3>€0.7</fact3> * 20 = €14.
The remaining 70 minutes are charged at a rate of <fact5>€0.4 per two minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to €0.2 per minute. So, the total cost for this part is €0.2 * 70 = €14.
The total cost of the call is €12 + €14 + €14 = €40.
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>€15</fact6>, we get a <fact7>20% discount on the total bill</fact7>. The discount amount is €40 * 0.2 = €8.
Therefore, the final cost of the <fact8>105-minute call</fact8> is €40 - €8 = €32.

Luis can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. In addition, Luis owns a <fact4>9-square meter apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>13 apricots per square meter</fact5>. The apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does Luis harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years. Since Luis can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of grapes per square meter is <fact2>16 grapes per five-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, so the number of grapes per square meter is 16 / (5/6) = 16 * 6 / 5 = 96 / 5 = 19.2 grapes per square meter. Therefore, the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years is 2 * <fact1>60 square meters of grape field</fact1> * 19.2 grapes per square meter = 2 * 60 * 19.2 = 2304 grapes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years. Since the apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Luis can harvest 6 times in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years is 6 * <fact4>9-square meter apricot field</fact4> * <fact5>13 apricots per square meter</fact5> = 6 * 9 * 13 = 702 apricots.

Finally, we subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of grapes to find the difference. The difference is 2304 - 702 = 1602.

Mia recently bought <fact7>a tube of bouncy balls</fact7>, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to <fact8>320</fact8>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>42 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>8 stuffed animals</fact2> = 50 items. 
Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. So, there are 2 * 50 = 100 action figures.
Next, we find the total number of crayons in the crayon box, which is <fact4>12 different colors of crayon</fact4>.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>43 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>5 stuffed animals</fact2> = 48 items.
Then, we can find the number of action figures in the action figure pack. This is 2 * 48 = <fact3>96 action figures</fact3>.
Next, we can find the total number of crayons and stickers. This is <fact4>12 crayons</fact4> + <fact5>6 pages</fact5> * <fact5>12 stickers per page</fact5> = 12 + 72 = 84 items.
Now, we can find the total number of items Gabrielle had before buying the bouncy balls. This is 48 blocks and stuffed animals + <fact3>96 action figures</fact3> + 84 crayons and stickers + <fact6>29 stacking rings</fact6> = 257 items.
Finally, we can find the number of bouncy balls in the tube by subtracting the total number of items Gabrielle had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of items she has now. This is <fact8>320 total items</fact8> - 257 items = 63 bouncy balls.

He bought <fact1>10 rulers which cost ₺9.0 each</fact1>, <fact2>6 colored pencils which cost ₺14.0 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost ₺18</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>8 crayons which cost ₺11 each</fact4>. Yusuf can either pay <fact5>a one-time ₺20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Yusuf can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the rulers is <fact1>10 rulers</fact1> * ₺9.0 = ₺90. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact2>6 colored pencils</fact2> * ₺14.0 = ₺84. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>₺18</fact3>. The cost of the crayons is <fact4>8 crayons</fact4> * ₺11 = ₺88. The total cost is ₺90 + ₺84 + ₺18 + ₺88 = ₺280.

If Yusuf becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time ₺20 fee</fact5>. The discount amount will be 20% of ₺280, which is 0.20 * ₺280 = ₺56. The total cost after the discount will be ₺280 - ₺56 = ₺224. Adding the one-time fee, the total cost will be ₺224 + ₺20 = ₺244.

If Yusuf does not become a member, he will receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. The discount amount will be 5% of ₺280, which is 0.05 * ₺280 = ₺14. The total cost after the discount will be ₺280 - ₺14 = ₺266.

Since ₺244 is less than ₺266, the least amount Yusuf can spend on everything is ₺244.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: There are <fact2>half of 240 balls</fact2> = <fact1>240</fact1>/2 = 120 golf balls. 
<fact3>A tenth of the golf balls are brown</fact3>, so there are 120/10 = 12 brown golf balls. 
Of those, <fact4>1/3 are marked</fact4>, so there are 12/3 = 4 marked brown golf balls. 
There are <fact1>240</fact1> - 120 = 120 tennis balls. 
<fact5>A quarter of the tennis balls are purple</fact5>, so there are 120/4 = 30 purple tennis balls. 
Of those, all except <fact6>a tenth of those purple balls</fact6> are marked, so there are 30 - 30/10 = 30 - 3 = 27 marked purple tennis balls. 
Therefore, there are 4 + 27 = 31 marked balls in total.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $590000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$590000</fact2> = $118000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$590000</fact2> - $118000 = $472000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 x <fact2>$590000</fact2> = $17700. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 x <fact2>$590000</fact2> = $70800.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $472000 + $17700 + $70800 = $560500.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$490000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $560500 - <fact1>$490000</fact1> = $70500.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's assume that Elena used x sets of the ratio of <fact1>44:11</fact1> for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Then, she used 44x teaspoons of sugar and 11x cups of water. Since she uses <fact2>10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, she used 11x * (10/10) = 11x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, she used 44x * 2 = 88x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>210</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 44x + 11x + 88x + 11x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 154x = 210. Dividing both sides by 154, we get x = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a set). Since x represents the number of sets of the ratio, we multiply x by 44 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 1 * 44 = 44.

Due to the pandemic, <fact4>45 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/3 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>1/3</fact2> = 633.33, which we will round down to 633 rooms.

Next, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since <fact3>one-sixth of all the rooms are out of service</fact3>, the number of rooms out of service is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact3>1/6</fact3> = 316.67, which we will round down to 316 rooms.

Now, we can find the initial number of unoccupied rooms. This is <fact1>1900</fact1> - 633 - 316 = 951 rooms.

Since <fact4>45 patients are admitted each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>45</fact4> * <fact5>14</fact5> = 630 patients.

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $450000</fact2>, which is 0.2 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $90000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$450000</fact2> - $90000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $13500. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $63000.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the discounted selling price plus the brokerage fee and transfer fee, which is $360000 + $13500 + $63000 = $436500.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's budget. The difference is $436500 - <fact1>$390000</fact1> = $46500.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of golf balls and tennis balls. The number of golf balls is <fact1>480</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 60. The number of tennis balls is <fact1>480</fact1> - 60 = 420, which is also <fact3>the rest</fact3> of the balls.

The number of cyan tennis balls is 420 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = 46.67, which we will round down to 46 since we can't have a fraction of a ball. The number of marked tennis balls is 46 * <fact7>9/10</fact7> = 41.4, which we will also round down to 41.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>6 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Emma remain with?

Answer: Emma originally had <fact2>10 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>10</fact2> * 65 = 650 potted plants. She then received <fact1>44 new potted plants</fact1> and purchased <fact3>180 new plants</fact3> at a 50% discount, which means she purchased 180 * 0.5 = 90 plants. So, she had 650 + <fact1>44</fact1> + 90 = 784 potted plants. She then gave away <fact4>6 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, so she gave away <fact4>6</fact4> * 65 = 390 potted plants.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1400 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/3 occupied</fact2>, which means 1/3 * <fact1>1400</fact1> = 466.67 beds are occupied. Since we can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 466 beds. Additionally, <fact3>one-sixth of all the beds are out of service</fact3>, which is 1/6 * <fact1>1400</fact1> = 233.33 beds. Again, we'll round down to 233 beds. The total number of unavailable beds is 466 + 233 = 699 beds. 

Initially, the number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1400</fact1> - 699 = 701 beds. 

Since <fact4>25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>3 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>25 patients/day</fact4> * 7 days/week * <fact5>3 weeks</fact5> = 525 patients. 

Assuming all admitted patients occupy a bed, the number of unoccupied beds after <fact5>3 weeks</fact5> is 701 - 525 = 176 beds.

Qasim has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>. How much money is Qasim still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>3-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>$150</fact2> * 3 = $450. The cost of the food is <fact3>$30</fact3> * 3 = $90. The cost of the transportation is <fact4>$30</fact4> * 3 = $90. So, the total cost is $450 + $90 + $90 = $630. 

Since Qasim's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, Qasim only needs to pay $630 - $90 = $540. 

Qasim has <fact5>$95</fact5>, so he still needs $540 - $95 = $445. 

The school will cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>, which is $445 * 1/5 = $89. 

So, Qasim still needs $445 - $89 = $356.

Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>. In addition, Xavier owns a <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> that produces <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>. The plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With <fact1>65 square meters of apple field</fact1>, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> and <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of apples and plums harvested in two years. The difference is 4225 - 858 = 3367.

Answer: Dr. Johnson paid <fact2>1% of the selling price</fact2> in legal fees, which is <fact2>0.01</fact2> * <fact1>$780000</fact1> = $7800. He also paid <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3> in realtor fees, which is <fact3>0.04</fact3> * <fact1>$780000</fact1> = $31200. Adding these fees to the <fact4>$490000 remaining loan amount</fact4> and the <fact5>$10000 closing costs</fact5>, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $7800 + $31200 + $490000 + $10000 = $538000.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of questions for each subject. The number of physics questions is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2> = 20. The number of biology questions is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact3>0.10</fact3> = 8. The number of algebra and geometry questions is <fact1>80</fact1> - 20 - 8 = 52, and since they are equally divided, there are 52/2 = 26 questions for each subject.

Now, let's calculate the number of correct answers for each subject. For biology, Kayla will get <fact4>25% of 8 questions</fact4> correct, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2. For physics, Kayla will get <fact5>65% of 20 questions</fact5> correct, which is 0.65 * 20 = 13.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $580000</fact2>, which is 0.2 * <fact2>$580000</fact2> = $116000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$580000</fact2> - $116000 = $464000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * <fact2>$580000</fact2> = $17400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 * <fact2>$580000</fact2> = $69600.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $464000 + $17400 + $69600 = $550000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$400000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $550000 - <fact1>$400000</fact1> = $150000.

If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>14 kilometers</fact3> / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 42 minutes = 102 minutes.
