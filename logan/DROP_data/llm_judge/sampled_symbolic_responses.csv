43,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Roya went to their backyard to pick some cherries and found three times as many caterpillars as grasshoppers in the field</fact1>. If <fact2>there were 115 grasshoppers</fact2>, calculate the total number of insects in the field.
Answer: <fact1>Roya found three times as many caterpillars as grasshoppers</fact1>. This means that the number of caterpillars is 3 times the number of grasshoppers. Since <fact2>there were 115 grasshoppers</fact2>, the number of caterpillars is 3 * 115 = 345. To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of caterpillars and the number of grasshoppers. So, the total number of insects is 345 + 115 = 460. Therefore, the total number of insects in the field is 460.",8b,1,460.0,1.0,symbolic,2194.0

Answer: To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by the length of each remora. So, the combined length of the remoras is <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact2>21</fact2> = 84 inches. 
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the dolphin to inches by multiplying it by 12. So, the length of the dolphin is <fact1>70</fact1> * <fact1>12</fact1> = 840 inches.
Now, we can find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the dolphin and multiplying by 100. So, the percentage is (84/<fact1>840</fact1>) * <fact3>100</fact3> = 10%.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails Xena receives in a 6 day work week. Since Xena receives <fact1>150 emails a day</fact1>, in a <fact3>6 day work week</fact3>, she receives 150 * 6 = 900 emails.
Then, we need to find out how many emails Xena doesn't need to respond to. Since <fact2>24% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, we need to find 24% of 900. This is equal to 0.24 * 900 = 216 emails.
Now, we need to find out how many emails Xena responds to. This is equal to the total number of emails she receives minus the number of emails she doesn't need to respond to. So, this is equal to 900 - 216 = 684 emails.
Therefore, Xena responds to 684 emails in a 6 day work week.",8b,1,684.0,1.0,symbolic,1354.0

Answer: The <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact2>6</fact2> = 12 inches.
To find the <fact3>percentage of the dolphin's body length</fact3> that this is, we need to convert the <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> from inches to feet. There are <fact5>12 inches</fact5> per <fact6>foot</fact6>, so the <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> is 12/<fact5>12</fact5> = 1 foot.
The <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1> is <fact1>50 feet</fact1>, so the <fact3>percentage of the dolphin's body length</fact3> that the <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> is is 1/<fact1>50</fact1> = 0.02, or 2%.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Ravi is rolling a ten-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: A ten-sided die has <fact1>10</fact1> sides. The numbers on a standard ten-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Of these numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are odd and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are even.
There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a ten-sided die.
There are <fact1>5</fact1> odd numbers on the die, and <fact1>5</fact1> even numbers.
Thus, the probability of rolling an odd number on a ten-sided die is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1> and the probability of rolling an even number is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number and then rolling another odd number. This probability is <fact1>1/2</fact1> * <fact1>1/2</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the probability of rolling a number that is greater than 5, which is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>.
To find the difference in probabilities, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5. This difference is <fact1>1/2</fact1> - <fact1>1/4</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>.
To convert this to a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. This is <fact1>1/4</fact1> * 100 = 25.
Therefore, Ravi is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than he is to roll two odd numbers in a row.

How much more is the total price of the apartment than <fact5>Ms. Johnson's budget</fact5>?
Answer: The <fact2>selling price of the property</fact2> is <fact2>$420000</fact2>. The <fact3>brokerage fee</fact3> is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the selling price, which is <fact3>7%</fact3> * <fact2>$420000</fact2> = $29400.

How much more is the total price of the condo than Dr. Patel's budget?

Answer: The total price of the condo is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories are in the bag of popcorn. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag and each serving has <fact1>400 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>400</fact1> = 2000 calories. 

Since you have already consumed <fact5>1375 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2255</fact4> - <fact5>1375</fact5> = 880 calories. 

To find out how many servings you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: <fact4>880</fact4> / <fact1>400</fact1> = 2.2 servings. 

Since you can't eat a fraction of a serving, you can eat 2 servings. 

To find out how many grams you can eat, multiply the number of servings by the total weight of the bag: <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact2>275</fact2> = 550 grams.

If he also paid <fact4>$310000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo</fact4>, how much is <fact5>Mr. Davis's net proceeds from selling the condo</fact5>?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the total amount of fees that Mr. Davis paid. The transfer fees amount to <fact2>3%</fact2> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$930000</fact1>. So, the transfer fees are <fact2>3%</fact2> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = <fact2>3/100</fact2> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = $27900. Similarly, the brokerage fee is also <fact3>3%</fact3> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$930000</fact1>. So, the brokerage fee is <fact3>3%</fact3> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = <fact3>3/100</fact3> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = $27900. Therefore, the total amount of fees that Mr. Davis paid is $27900 + $27900 = $55800. Now, we need to subtract the total amount of fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Davis's net proceeds. Mr. Davis's net proceeds are <fact1>$930000</fact1> - <fact4>$310000</fact4> - <fact6>$55800</fact6> = $930000 - $310000 - $55800 = $743000.",8b,0,564200.0,1.0,symbolic,1702.0

Answer: The total amount of legal fees that Dr. Smith paid is <fact2>4%</fact2> * <fact1>$560000</fact1> = $22400. The total amount of the realtor fee that Dr. Smith paid is <fact6>3%</fact6> * <fact1>$560000</fact1> = $16800. Therefore, the total amount that Dr. Smith paid for the legal fees and the realtor fee is $22400 + $16800 = $39200. Dr. Smith's net proceeds from selling the house is <fact1>$560000</fact1> - <fact8>$490000</fact8> - <fact11>$39200</fact11> = $560000 - $490000 - $39200 = $71800.

If the city is <fact2>93 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance that the fog bank covers per 280 minutes. The fog bank covers <fact1>3 miles</fact1> every 280 minutes.

Answer: On <fact2>Saturday</fact2>, Pavel sold <fact3>22 boxes of cupcake</fact3> and <fact4>13 fewer boxes of plum pie</fact4> than on <fact5>Sunday</fact5>. This means that on <fact5>Sunday</fact5>, he sold <fact3>22</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> = 35 boxes of cupcake. He also sold <fact8>22 boxes of plum pie</fact8> on <fact6>Sunday</fact6>. To find out how many boxes of cupcake and plum pie he sold on <fact2>Saturday</fact2>, we need to subtract 11 from the number of cupcake boxes he sold on <fact6>Sunday</fact6> and subtract 13 from the number of plum pie boxes he sold on <fact6>Sunday</fact6>. So, on <fact2>Saturday</fact2>, he sold <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact7>11</fact7> = 11 boxes of cupcake and <fact8>22</fact8> - <fact4>13</fact4> = 9 boxes of plum pie. The total number of cupcake boxes he sold over the two days is 11 + 35 = 46. The total number of plum pie boxes he sold over the two days is 9 + 22 = 31. Pavel earned <fact9>$7</fact9> per cupcake and <fact10>$27</fact10> per plum pie. So, he earned 46 * <fact9>$7</fact9> + 31 * <fact10>$27</fact10> = $322 + $837 = $1159 for two days.

Answer: Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let <fact3>s</fact3> be the number of teaspoons of sugar and <fact4>w</fact4> be the number of cups of water. We know that <fact1>197</fact1> : <fact4>94</fact4> = <fact3>s</fact3> : <fact4>w</fact4>, so we can write <fact5>197w = 94s</fact5>. We are also given that <fact2>1455 = s + w</fact2>. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of <fact3>s</fact3>. Rearranging the second equation, we get <fact6>w = 1455 - s</fact6>. Substituting this into the first equation, we get <fact7>197(1455 - s) = 94s</fact7>. Expanding and simplifying, we get <fact8>288,095 - 197s = 94s</fact8>.

Answer: To find out how much the tea costs, we need to find out how much tea James buys. Since James buys a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact4>2 kilogram of tea per day</fact4>, he buys <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact6>7 days</fact6> = <fact7>14 kilogram</fact7> of tea.
The normal brand of tea costs <fact2>₣15 per kilogram</fact2>, so the normal brand of tea costs <fact2>₣15</fact2> * <fact7>14 kilogram</fact7> = <fact8>₣210</fact8>.
The more expensive brand of tea costs <fact3>40% more</fact3> than the normal brand, so it costs <fact9>₣15</fact9> + <fact9>₣15</fact9> * <fact3>40%</fact3> = <fact9>₣21</fact9> per kilogram.

The transfer fee is <fact4>13%</fact4> of <fact2>$440000</fact2>, which is <fact4>13%</fact4>*<fact2>$440000</fact2> = 0.13*440000 = $57200.
The total price of the townhouse is the selling price plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, which is <fact2>$440000</fact2> + <fact5>$26400</fact5> + <fact6>$57200</fact6> = $493800.
The difference between the total price of the townhouse and Mrs. Lee's budget is <fact7>$493800</fact7> - <fact1>$480000</fact1> = $13800.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Esteban is rolling a 4-sided die</fact1>. <fact2>How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row</fact2>?
Answer: A 4-sided die has 4 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
A number greater than 2 can be either 3 or 4, which are 2 possible outcomes. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>2</fact1>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling two 2's in a row, which is <fact3>1</fact3>/<fact2>4</fact2> * <fact3>1</fact3>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 1/16 or 6.25%.
The difference between the two probabilities is 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.
Therefore, it is 43.75% more likely that Esteban rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
The answer is {43.75}.",8b,0,25.0,1.0,symbolic,124.0

On the sidewalk, <fact4>Nia walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>28-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: We are given that <fact2>13 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> takes <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. Since <fact1>Nia walks 28 miles every day</fact1>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> = 0.2 miles/minute. Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk as <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, which is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6 miles/minute. Since <fact3>15 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> takes <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> / 0.2 * 0.6 = 195 minutes, we can calculate the total time taken to complete the entire 28-mile walk as <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> + 195 minutes = 260 minutes.",8b,0,90.0,1.0,symbolic,865.0

If he watched <fact9>27 hours</fact9> of TV in all, how many <fact4>45-minute</fact4> episodes did he watch on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>?
Answer: On <fact1>Sunday and Monday</fact1>, Wei watched a total of <fact2>5 hours</fact2> * 2 nights = 10 hours of TV.
On <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>, he watched <fact10>some</fact10> episodes of a <fact4>45-minute</fact4> show. We will call this number x. 
On <fact5>Wednesday</fact5>, he watched a <fact6>5-hour</fact6> episode and a <fact4>45-minute</fact4> episode. 
On <fact7>Thursday</fact7>, he watched two <fact8>3-hour</fact8> episodes. 
So, in total, Wei watched 10 + <fact10>x</fact10> + 5 + 1 + 2*3 = 27 hours of TV.
Therefore, <fact10>x</fact10> + 10 + 5 + 1 + 6 = 27.

If the <fact5>muffin cost ₺12</fact5> and the <fact6>watermelon pie cost ₺31</fact6>, how much did Jin earn for two days?
Answer: On <fact1>Tuesday</fact1>, Jin sold <fact1>23</fact1> boxes of muffin and <fact2>13 fewer boxes of watermelon pie</fact2> than on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>. So, he sold <fact2>23 - 13</fact2> = 10 boxes of watermelon pie on <fact1>Tuesday</fact1>.
On <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>, Jin sold <fact3>14 more boxes of muffins</fact3> than on <fact1>Tuesday</fact1>. So, he sold <fact1>23 + 14</fact1> = 37 boxes of muffin on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>.
On <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>, Jin sold <fact4>28 boxes of watermelon pie</fact4>.
The total number of boxes of muffin Jin sold is <fact1>23</fact1> + <fact3>37</fact3> = 60 boxes.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> is 9/10, since there are 9 numbers greater than 1 on a <fact1>ten-sided die</fact1> and 10 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number is 5/10, since there are 5 even numbers on a <fact1>ten-sided die</fact1> and 10 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100, since the rolls are independent events. To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> from the probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2>: 9/10 - 25/100 = 0.9 - 0.25 = 0.65.

Answer: There are <fact2>10%</fact2> * <fact1>50 questions</fact1> = 5 geography questions. Kimia is sure to get <fact4>60%</fact4> * 5 geography questions = 3 geography questions correct.
There are <fact1>50 questions</fact1> - 5 geography questions = 45 algebra and chemistry questions. Since they are equally divided, there are 45/2 = 22.5 questions of each type.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. 
To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, Ava and Quinn compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ava has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>2 more weeks</fact4> of spring break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Ava is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Quinn decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Ava currently has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2>, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. Together, they have 30 + 37 = 67 signatures. Their goal is to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 67 = 68 signatures in the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Ava's collection will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so over the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> she will collect 5 * 2 = 10 fewer signatures than she did during the first <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>.  We don't know her exact rate during the first 3 weeks, but it's not necessary. We only need to know her reduction from the previous rate.

Therefore, Quinn needs to collect the remaining signatures herself, taking into account Ava's reduced rate: 68 signatures (total needed) - 10 signatures (Ava's reduction) = 58 signatures.  Since there are <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> left, Quinn needs to collect 58 / 2 = 29 signatures per week to reach their goal.

She wants to make a <fact2>vest, cardigan, shawl, gloves, and mittens</fact2> for each of them. It takes <fact3>5 skeins of wool to make a vest</fact3>, <fact4>4 for a cardigan</fact4>, <fact5>10 for a shawl</fact5>, <fact6>12 for a pair of gloves</fact6>, and <fact7>9 for a pair of mittens</fact7>. Sakura wants to make <fact8>two warm jackets for herself</fact8>, each needing <fact9>4 skeins of wool</fact9>. Each <fact10>dozen skeins of wool costs $9</fact10>. The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact11>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact11>. How much should Sakura pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins of wool needed for each grandchild.  For each grandchild, Sakura needs:

* Vest: <fact3>5 skeins</fact3>
* Cardigan: <fact4>4 skeins</fact4>
* Shawl: <fact5>10 skeins</fact5>
* Gloves: <fact6>12 skeins</fact6>
* Mittens: <fact7>9 skeins</fact7>

Total per grandchild: 5 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 40 skeins

Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 40 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 160 skeins for her grandchildren.

Next, let's calculate the wool needed for her jackets. She needs <fact9>4 skeins</fact9>/jacket * <fact8>2 jackets</fact8> = 8 skeins for herself.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Sakura needs is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.

Now, let's calculate the cost.  Since each <fact10>dozen (12) skeins costs $9</fact10>, the cost of 168 skeins is (168/12) * $9 = 14 * $9 = $126.

Finally, let's apply the discount. Since the total cost ($126) is <fact11>over $100</fact11>, Sakura receives a <fact11>$20 discount</fact11>.  So, the final amount Sakura should pay is $126 - $20 = $106.

How much more do <fact5>2 loaves of sourdough</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>?

Answer:  The cost of one muffin is one-eighth the cost of a loaf of sourdough, which is <fact1>$10</fact1> / 8 = $1.25. Since we are buying <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>, and this is more than <fact3>6 muffins</fact3>, we apply the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>.  The discount per muffin is $1.25 * 0.10 = $0.125.  Therefore, the discounted price per muffin is $1.25 - $0.125 = $1.125. The cost of <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> is 8 * $1.125 = $9. The cost of <fact5>2 loaves of sourdough</fact5> is 2 * <fact1>$10</fact1> = $20.  The difference in cost is $20 - $9 = $11.

She bought <fact1>60 croissants at $19 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>72 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>36 brownies</fact3>. After a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1330</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Nia bought <fact1>60 croissants</fact1>, which is 60/12 = 5 dozen croissants.  The cost of the croissants is 5 dozen * <fact1>$19/dozen</fact1> = $95.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons.  Nia bought <fact2>72 macarons</fact2>, which is 72/12 = 6 dozen macarons. The cost of the macarons is 6 dozen * <fact2>$20/dozen</fact2> = $120.

Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $95 + $120 = $215.  Let's denote the cost of the 36 brownies as 'x'.  So, before the discount, the total cost of all items was $215 + x.

Nia received a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, meaning she paid 95% of the original price.  Therefore, 0.95 * ($215 + x) = <fact5>$1330</fact5>.

To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 0.95: $215 + x = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400

Subtracting $215 from both sides, we find the total cost of the brownies: x = $1400 - $215 = $1185.

Finally, since Nia bought <fact3>36 brownies</fact3>, this is 36/12 = 3 dozen brownies. Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen is $1185 / 3 = $395.

The answer is {395}.

Answer: A d4 die has four sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For <fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>:  There are three numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4). The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. To roll it twice in a row, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.  Expressed as a percentage, this is (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%.

For <fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>: There are two odd numbers on a d4 die (1 and 3). The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%.

The difference in likelihood is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points.

Therefore, it is 50 percentage points more likely that Gabriel rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.  The answer is {50}.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>7 less than two times the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the total number of students who enjoy dance, chess, swimming, and volleyball.  This is <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>32</fact5> = 58 students.

Next, we determine the number of students who like to play music.  The question states that this number is <fact6>7 less than two times the number of students who prefer playing volleyball</fact6>.  Since <fact5>32 students like to play volleyball</fact5>, the number of students who like music is (2 * 32) - 7 = 57 students.

Now we can find the number of students who like to play video games. The total number of students is <fact1>230</fact1>. Subtracting the students with other hobbies, we get 230 - 58 - 57 = 115 students who like video games.

Finally, to find the percentage of students who like video games, we divide the number of students who like video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (115 / 230) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, 50% of the students like to play video games.  The answer is {50}.

How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three?

Answer:

First, let's find Ravi's current age using <fact1>Ravi will be 47 in 8 years</fact1>.  His current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old.

Next, let's find Pavel's current age using <fact3>Ravi and Pavel are currently 22 years apart in age</fact3> and the fact that Ravi is younger than Pavel.  Pavel's current age is 39 + 22 = 61 years old.

Now, let's find Leilani's current age using <fact4>Ravi and Leilani are currently 10 years apart in age</fact4> and the fact that Ravi is older than Leilani. Leilani's current age is 39 - 10 = 29 years old.

To find the average age of all three, we add their ages together and divide by 3: (39 + 61 + 29) / 3 = 129 / 3 = 43 years old.

Finally, to determine how much younger Leilani is than the average age, we subtract Leilani's age from the average age: 43 - 29 = 14 years.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by <fact4>25% for the first half of the month</fact4>, and then by an <fact5>additional 50% for the second half</fact5>. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The uncle and spouse together eat <fact1>16</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2> = 32 pizzas per day.  The grandchild eats half of this, which is 32 / 2 = <fact3>16 pizzas per day</fact3>.  Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 32 + 16 = 48 pizzas per day.

Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 48 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 1440 pizzas in the first month.

In the second month, they reduce their consumption. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>25%</fact4>.  This means they eat 48 pizzas/day * 0.75 = 36 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas.

For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an <fact5>additional 50%</fact5> from the already reduced amount.  So they eat 36 pizzas/day * 0.5 = 18 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas.

Therefore, in the second month, they eat a total of 540 + 270 = 810 pizzas.

Over the two months, the family eats 1440 + 810 = 2250 pizzas.

Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  <fact2>25% of 32 emails don't need a response</fact2>, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails.  This means 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many emails Sanjay responds to daily. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails that require a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Sanjay responds to during the first three days of the work week. For three days, he responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

On the last day, <fact5>Sanjay responds to 20% more emails than usual</fact5>.  This is an increase of 0.20 * 10 = 2 emails. So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails.

This leaves a total of 500 + 700 - 40 = 1160 apartments requiring garbage collection.

<fact5> tells us Hiroshi collects garbage twice a week from each apartment. So he makes 1160 apartments * 2 collections/apartment = 2320 collections.

His base pay is 2320 collections * <fact6>₣0.25/collection</fact6> = ₣580.

Finally, he receives an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>, so his tip earnings are 0.10 * 580 = ₣58.

Therefore, his total weekly earnings are ₣580 + ₣58 = ₣638.  The answer is {638}.

On <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>, he watched a few episodes of a <fact4>30-minute show</fact4>. On <fact5>Wednesday</fact5>, he finished homework early and watched a <fact6>2-hour episode</fact6> and a <fact7>60-minute show</fact7>. On <fact8>Thursday</fact8>, he got to stay up late, so he watched <fact9>three 3-hour episodes</fact9>. On <fact10>Friday</fact10>, he watched <fact11>three episodes</fact11>, each <fact4>30 minutes</fact4>. If he watched <fact12>24 hours of TV in all</fact12>, how many <fact4>30-minute episodes</fact4> did he watch on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Sunday through Friday, excluding Tuesday.

* **Sunday and Monday:**  He watched 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV.
* **Wednesday:** He watched a 2-hour episode + a 1-hour episode = 3 hours of TV.
* **Thursday:** He watched 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours of TV.
* **Friday:** He watched 3 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 1.5 hours of TV.

Total TV time excluding Tuesday: 8 + 3 + 9 + 1.5 = 21.5 hours.

Since he watched a total of <fact12>24 hours of TV</fact12>, the time spent watching TV on Tuesday was 24 hours - 21.5 hours = 2.5 hours.  Each episode on Tuesday was <fact4>30 minutes</fact4> or 0.5 hours long. Therefore, he watched 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 5 episodes on Tuesday. The answer is {5}.

He paid registration fees that amounted to <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2> and also paid an agent fee that is <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3>. He also paid <fact4>$570,000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and <fact5>$15,000</fact5> for closing costs. Prof. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: First, we calculate the registration fees: <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$760,000</fact1> is 0.03 * $760,000 = $22,800.

Next, we calculate the agent fee: <fact3>4%</fact3> of <fact1>$760,000</fact1> is 0.04 * $760,000 = $30,400.

The total fees and costs paid by Prof. Miller are the registration fees ($22,800) + the agent fee ($30,400) + the remaining loan amount (<fact4>$570,000</fact4>) + closing costs (<fact5>$15,000</fact5>) = $638,200.

Prof. Miller's net proceeds from the sale are the selling price (<fact1>$760,000</fact1>) minus the total fees and costs ($638,200) which equals $121,800.

This amount ($121,800) was invested in stocks.  After the first year, the stocks gained 10%, so the value increased by 0.10 * $121,800 = $12,180. The value at the end of the first year is $121,800 + $12,180 = $133,980.

After the second year, the stocks gained another 10%, which is 0.10 * $133,980 = $13,398.  Therefore, Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years are $133,980 + $13,398 = $147,378.

Answer:

First, let's determine the number of questions in each subject.

* **Chemistry:** <fact2>40% of 100 questions</fact2> = 0.40 * 100 = 40 questions
* **Geography:** <fact3>20% of 100 questions</fact3> = 0.20 * 100 = 20 questions
* **History and Algebra:** The remaining questions are 100 - 40 - 20 = 40 questions.  Since these are equally divided, there are 40 / 2 = 20 questions in each subject.

Next, let's calculate how many questions Aisha is sure to answer correctly in each subject:

* **Chemistry:** Aisha is sure to get <fact5>100% of the 40 chemistry questions</fact5>, so she will get 1.00 * 40 = 40 questions correct.
* **Geography:** Aisha is sure to get <fact4>25% of the 20 geography questions</fact4>, so she will get 0.25 * 20 = 5 questions correct.
* **History and Algebra:** Aisha is sure to get <fact6>a tenth of the 20 history and 20 algebra questions</fact6>, meaning she'll get (1/10) * 20 + (1/10) * 20 = 4 questions correct in total from these two subjects (2 correct from each subject).


Finally, let's add up the number of questions Aisha is sure to answer correctly across all subjects: 40 + 5 + 4 = 49 questions.  Since each question is worth one point, Aisha is sure to get 49 points.

Therefore, the answer is {49}.

How much money does Valeria have left?

Answer: Let's break down Valeria's spending:

* **Cotton Candy:**  She bought 23 pounds. The sale is for 15 pounds at €21/pound, with an additional 5 pounds at a 1/3 discount (€21 * (1 - 1/3) = €14).  The cost of the first 15 pounds is 15 * €21 = €315.  The cost of the next 5 pounds (at a discount) is 5 * €14 = €70.  The cost of the remaining 3 pounds is 3 * €21 = €63. The total cost of the cotton candy is €315 + €70 + €63 = €448.

* **Coral:** The coral cost <fact5>€11.0</fact5>.

* **Pins:** The pins cost 11 * €21.0 = €231.

* **Charity:** Valeria donated <fact7>€5</fact7>.

Total spending: €448 + €11 + €231 + €5 = €695

Money left: Valeria started with <fact1>€1300</fact1> and spent €695.  Therefore, she has €1300 - €695 = €605 left.

Leon only has <fact4>¥155</fact4>. <fact5>His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop</fact5>. Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to <fact6>cover a fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Leon still missing?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop per day:  <fact1>¥150 (hotel)</fact1> + <fact2>¥30 (food)</fact2> + <fact3>¥10 (transportation)</fact3> = ¥190 per day. For a 2-day workshop, the total cost is ¥190 * 2 = ¥380.

Next, we subtract the cost covered by Leon's friends.  Since his friends are covering all the food, we need to calculate the daily food cost and then the total food cost for the 2 days.  The daily food cost is <fact2>¥30</fact2>, so for two days this is ¥30 * 2 = ¥60.  The total cost is now ¥380 - ¥60 = ¥320.

Now we consider the youth club's contribution. The youth club covers a fifth (<fact6>a fifth</fact6>) of the remaining cost, which is ¥320 / 5 = ¥64.

Therefore, after the youth club's contribution, the amount Leon still needs to raise is ¥320 - ¥64 = ¥256.  Finally, we consider the money Leon already has (<fact4>¥155</fact4>).  The amount Leon is still missing is ¥256 - ¥155 = ¥101.

The answer is {101}.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3>. Carlos weighs <fact4>200 lbs</fact4>, and he has already consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6> through exercise. Zahra weighs <fact7>150 lbs</fact7>, and she has already consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> in food and <fact9>225 calories</fact9> in ice cream. How many more ounces of breads does Carlos need to consume than Zahra?

Answer: First, let's calculate Carlos's calorie needs.  His healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. He has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, meaning his net calorie consumption is 900 - 150 = 750 calories. Therefore, he needs 3000 - 750 = 2250 more calories.

Next, let's calculate Zahra's calorie needs. Her healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>150 lbs</fact7> = 2250 calories. She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>225 calories</fact9> = 1125 calories.  Therefore, she needs 2250 - 1125 = 1125 more calories.

Now, let's figure out how many calories are in one ounce of bread.  A <fact2>300-ounce bag</fact2> has 5 servings, so each serving is 300/5 = 60 ounces.  Since each serving has <fact1>225 calories</fact1>, one ounce of bread contains 225/60 = 3.75 calories.

Carlos needs 2250 more calories, so he needs 2250 / 3.75 = 600 ounces of bread.  Zahra needs 1125 more calories, so she needs 1125 / 3.75 = 300 ounces of bread.

Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Carlos and Zahra need is 600 - 300 = 300 ounces.

The answer is {300}.

How many forks were in the package that Valentina bought?

Answer: Let's work backward from the final number of forks Valentina had.

* **Step 1: Account for guest forks:** The guests brought 2 packs * 8 forks/pack = 16 forks.  Subtract these from the final total: 49 - 16 = 33 forks.

* **Step 2: Account for used and defective forks:** Valentina used 6 forks and threw away 8 defective forks, meaning she lost 6 + 8 = 14 forks. Add these back to the total from Step 1: 33 + 14 = 47 forks.

* **Step 3: Account for husband's contribution:**  Her husband gave her 19 forks. Subtract these from the total from Step 2: 47 - 19 = 28 forks.

Therefore, the package Valentina bought initially contained 28 forks.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>3 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow</fact4>. How many potted plants will Sakura remain with?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Sakura had before receiving any new plants.  She had <fact2>7 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 420 plants</fact2>.

Next, let's account for the new plants. Two days ago, she received <fact1>49 new plants</fact1>, and yesterday, she bought <fact3>100 new plants</fact3>.  This means she received a total of 49 + 100 = 149 new plants. Note that the 50% discount is irrelevant to the total number of plants she now has.

So, before giving plants away, Sakura had 420 + 149 = 569 potted plants.

Finally, she will give away <fact4>3 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 180 plants</fact4>.

Therefore, Sakura will remain with 569 - 180 = 389 potted plants.  The answer is {389}.

If they work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer:  The janitor initially takes <fact3>6 minutes</fact3> to clean a room, but due to the injury (<fact4>twice as long</fact4>), it now takes them 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes per room.  To clean all <fact1>80 rooms</fact1>, it will take them 12 minutes/room * 80 rooms = 960 minutes.

Over <fact2>4 days</fact2>, this means they need to work an average of 16 hours / 4 days = 4 hours per day.

They work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, and spend 4 hours cleaning. Therefore, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is (4 hours / 10 hours) * 100% = 40%.

If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Fatima's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Due to her injury, her current speed on the beach is s/2.  Since she walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, her current speed on the beach is:

Speed_beach = Distance_beach / Time_beach = <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles/minute

Her original speed on the beach was therefore 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute.

According to <fact4>the problem</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk was three times her beach speed, which is 3 * 0.5 miles/minute = 1.5 miles/minute.  Due to the injury, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles/minute / 2 = 0.75 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is:

Time_sidewalk = Distance_sidewalk / Speed_sidewalk = <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes

Therefore, the total time to complete her walk is the sum of her time on the beach and her time on the sidewalk:

Note that Aisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel 120 clams.  Since she peels <fact1>10 clams per minute</fact1>, it will take her 120 clams / 10 clams/minute = 12 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we need to account for the clam washing time.  Washing each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4>, and there are 120 clams, so the total washing time is 120 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1680 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes.

The total time for peeling is the peeling time plus washing time: 12 minutes + 28 minutes = 40 minutes.

After peeling, Aisha takes a <fact5>7-minute break</fact5> before sautéing.

Now let's figure out the sautéing time.  Aisha sautés <fact2>30 clams in 6 minutes</fact2>, meaning her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 6 minutes = 5 clams per minute. To sauté <fact3>120 clams</fact3> will take 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes.

Finally, we add up all the times: 40 minutes (peeling and washing) + 7 minutes (break) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 71 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and sauté 120 clams. The answer is {71}.

Andre gives <fact6>1/10 of the made popcorn to his brother Jin</fact6>. How many more pieces of popcorn does Andre have to eat than his brother?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the popcorn popping in each 10-second interval:

* **Interval 1:** <fact1>80 kernels popped</fact1>.
* **Interval 2:** <fact2>4 * 80 = 320 kernels popped</fact2>.
* **Interval 3:** <fact3>6 * 80 = 480 kernels popped</fact3>.
* **Interval 4:** <fact4>480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped</fact4>.

After the pot is removed,  <fact5>240 / 4 = 60 kernels pop from residual heat</fact5>.

The total number of popped kernels is 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180.

Andre gives <fact6>1/10 of 1180 to Jin</fact6>, which is 1180 / 10 = 118 kernels.

Andre keeps 1180 - 118 = 1062 kernels.

The difference between the amount Andre eats and the amount Jin eats is 1062 - 118 = 944.

Therefore, Andre eats 944 more pieces of popcorn than his brother.  The answer is {944}.

What will be the average of all four in 4 years?

Answer:  First, let's determine Priya's current age.  In 5 years, Priya will be twice Diego's current age (<fact2>2 times as old as Diego is now</fact2>), which is 2 * <fact1>21</fact1> = 42 years old.  Therefore, Priya's current age is 42 - 5 = 37 years old.

Next, let's find Qasim's current age.  Qasim is 9 years younger than Diego (<fact3>Diego's brother, Qasim, is 9 years younger than Diego</fact3>), so Qasim is <fact1>21</fact1> - 9 = 12 years old.

Now, let's find Mia's current age. Mia is 10 years older than Qasim (<fact4>Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim</fact4>), making Mia 12 + 10 = 22 years old.

In 4 years, their ages will be:

* Diego: 21 + 4 = 25 years old
* Priya: 37 + 4 = 41 years old
* Qasim: 12 + 4 = 16 years old
* Mia: 22 + 4 = 26 years old

To find the average age in 4 years, we add their ages and divide by 4: (25 + 41 + 16 + 26) / 4 = 108 / 4 = 27 years old.

Therefore, the average age of all four in 4 years will be 27.

If the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

* **Apples:** <fact1>5 boxes * 7 pounds/box = 35 pounds</fact1>
* **Carrots:** <fact2>14 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 70 pounds</fact2>
* **Hay:** <fact3>35 packs * 44 pounds/pack = 1540 pounds</fact3>
* **Wheat:** <fact4>19 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 285 pounds</fact4>
* **Groceries:** <fact5>43 pounds</fact5>
* **Tools:** <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>
* **Wood:** <fact7>100 pounds</fact7>

Now, let's find the total weight of all the items: 35 + 70 + 1540 + 285 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 2100 pounds

Since each truck can carry <fact8>100 pounds</fact8>, the total number of trips needed with one truck would be 2100 pounds / 100 pounds/trip = 21 trips.

However, the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, so the number of trips per truck is 21 trips / 3 trucks = 7 trips per truck.

Therefore, the farmer needs a total of 21 trips to transport all the purchased items.  Each of the three trucks will make 7 trips.

Answer:  We know from <fact1>the question that there are 22 girls in the garden</fact1>.  <fact2>The question also states that the number of boys is three times less than the number of girls</fact2>. Therefore, the number of boys is 22 / 3 = 7.33 (approximately 7 boys since you cannot have a fraction of a boy). The total number of kids in the garden is 22 girls + 7 boys = 29 kids.  The percentage of girls is (22 girls / 29 total kids) * 100% = 75.86% (approximately 76%). Therefore, approximately 76% of the kids in the garden are girls.

24,"Reformatted Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has <fact1>175 calories per serving</fact1>. A <fact2>125 oz bag has 5 servings</fact2>. The healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3>. <fact4>Theo weighs 250 lbs</fact4>, and he has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6> through exercise. <fact7>Sakura weighs 130 lbs</fact7>, and she has already consumed <fact8>900 calories in food</fact8> and <fact9>175 calories in ice cream</fact9>. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

Answer: First, let's calculate Theo's and Sakura's calorie needs.  Theo's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact4>250 lbs</fact4> = 3750 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 150 = 950 calories. Therefore, Theo needs 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.  Sakura's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.  She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 1075 calories. Thus, Sakura needs 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Next, let's determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies.  Each serving contains <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a <fact2>125 oz bag</fact2> has 5 servings.  Therefore, one ounce of cookies contains 175 calories / 5 servings / (125 oz / 5 servings) = 2.8 calories/oz.


Now we can find out how many ounces of cookies each person needs. Theo needs 2800 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 1000 oz of cookies. Sakura needs 875 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 312.5 oz of cookies.


Finally, let's find the difference in the amount of cookies needed. Theo needs 1000 oz - 312.5 oz = 687.5 more ounces of cookies than Sakura.

The answer is {687.5}.

She bought <fact1>36 eclairs at $13 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>60 cookies at $26 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>24 muffins</fact3>. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$980</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>muffins per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the eclairs. Ava bought <fact1>36 eclairs at $13 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 36/12 = 3 dozen eclairs.  The cost of the eclairs is therefore 3 dozen * $13/dozen = $39.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cookies. Ava bought <fact2>60 cookies at $26 per dozen</fact2>, meaning she bought 60/12 = 5 dozen cookies. The cost of the cookies is 5 dozen * $26/dozen = $130.

Now, let's find the total cost before the discount.  Let 'x' be the cost of a dozen muffins. Ava bought <fact3>24 muffins</fact3>, which is 24/12 = 2 dozen muffins. The total cost before the discount was $39 (eclairs) + $130 (cookies) + 2x (muffins) = 169 + 2x.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, Ava paid <fact5>$980</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price is $980.  So, we can set up the equation: 0.80 * (169 + 2x) = 980.

Solving for x:
169 + 2x = 980 / 0.80
169 + 2x = 1225
2x = 1225 - 169
2x = 1056
x = 1056 / 2
x = 528

Therefore, the cost of the muffins per dozen is $528.  However, this answer seems unreasonable given the context. Let's re-examine our calculations.

**Corrected Calculation:**

The total cost *before* discount is 169 + 2x.  After a 20% discount, the amount paid is 80% of the original cost.  Thus:

0.8(169 + 2x) = 980
135.2 + 1.6x = 980
1.6x = 980 - 135.2
1.6x = 844.8
x = 844.8 / 1.6
x = 528

There must be a mistake in the problem statement. The calculated cost of muffins per dozen ($528) is unrealistically high compared to the cost of eclairs and cookies.  There's likely an error in the given total cost ($980).

She bought <fact1>24 croissants at $12 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>48 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants.  Aisha bought <fact1>24 croissants at $12 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 2 dozen croissants (24 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 2 dozen).  The cost of the croissants was 2 dozen * $12/dozen = $24.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Aisha bought <fact2>48 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, which means she bought 4 dozen macarons (48 macarons / 12 macarons/dozen = 4 dozen). The cost of the macarons was 4 dozen * $20/dozen = $80.

Now, let's find the pre-discount total cost. Before the discount, the total cost was the cost of the croissants plus the cost of the macarons plus the cost of the brownies (which we'll call 'x').  So, the pre-discount total was $24 + $80 + x.

Aisha received a <fact4>20% discount</fact4> and paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price was $1520.  We can set up an equation: 0.80 * ($24 + $80 + x) = $1520.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.80 * (104 + x) = 1520.  Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get: 104 + x = 1900.  Subtracting 104 from both sides, we find x = $1800.  Therefore, the total cost of the brownies was $1800.

Finally, since Aisha bought <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>, which is 2 dozen (24 brownies / 12 brownies/dozen = 2 dozen), the cost per dozen brownies was $1800 / 2 dozen = $900 per dozen.

The answer is {900}.

Chen then donated <fact8>$5</fact8> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Chen have left?

Answer: Let's break down Chen's spending:

First, the taffy: She bought <fact4>23 kgs</fact4> of taffy.  The deal was <fact2>16 kgs at $22/kg</fact2>, so that's 16 kgs * $22/kg = $352.  The additional <fact4>23-16=7 kgs</fact4> received a <fact3>1/4 discount</fact3>, meaning each kg cost $22 - ($22 * 0.25) = $16.50.  The cost of those 7 kgs is 7 kgs * $16.50/kg = $115.50.  Her total taffy cost is $352 + $115.50 = $467.50.

Next, the starfish and keychains: The starfish cost <fact5>$11.0</fact5>, and the keychains cost <fact6>11</fact6> * <fact7>$21.0</fact7> = $231.

Finally, the donation: Chen donated <fact8>$5</fact8>.

Therefore, her total spending is $467.50 + $11 + $231 + $5 = $714.50.

Starting with <fact1>$1300</fact1>, she has $1300 - $714.50 = $585.50 left.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of occupied beds: (1/6) * <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> = 216.67 beds. Since we cannot have a fraction of a bed, we round this down to 216 occupied beds.

Next, let's calculate the number of beds out of service: (2/6) * <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> = 433.33 beds.  Again, rounding down to the nearest whole number, we have 433 beds out of service.

The total number of beds unavailable is the sum of occupied and out-of-service beds: 216 + 433 = 649 beds.

The number of available beds is the total capacity minus the unavailable beds: <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> - 649 beds = 651 beds.

Over <fact5>2 weeks (14 days)</fact5>, the number of additional patients admitted is <fact4>30 patients/day</fact4> * <fact5>14 days</fact5> = 420 patients.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the cotton candy. Ava bought <fact4>23 pounds</fact4>.  The sale was for <fact2>17 pounds at $22 per pound</fact2>, which costs 17 * $22 = $374.  The discount on the extra <fact3>4 pounds</fact3> is (4 * $22) / 2 = $44. So the total cost of the cotton candy is $374 + (4*$22 - $44) = $374 + $44 = $418.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins: Ava bought <fact6>18 pins at $20.5 each</fact6>, costing 18 * $20.5 = $369.

If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Before her injury, her sidewalk speed was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, or 2s. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now s/2, and her speed on the sidewalk is now 2s/2 = s.

We know she spends <fact5>51 minutes on the beach</fact5> and covers <fact2>17 miles</fact2>. Therefore, her current beach speed is 17 miles / 51 minutes = 1/3 mile per minute.

Since her sidewalk speed is the same as her original speed on the beach, her current sidewalk speed is also 1/3 mile per minute.  The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance on the sidewalk (<fact3>16 miles</fact3>) divided by her sidewalk speed (1/3 mile/minute), which is 16 miles / (1/3 mile/minute) = 48 minutes.

To find the total walking time, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 51 minutes (beach) + 48 minutes (sidewalk) = 99 minutes.

Benjamin then eats <fact6>one-eighth of all the crackers</fact6>. How many more bowls does Benjamin need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, let's determine the capacity of each plate.  Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers as a bowl (<fact1>21 crackers per bowl</fact1>), each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers.

Next, calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates before the breakage.  Benjamin has <fact3>9 bowls</fact3>, each holding <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, for a total of 9 * 21 = 189 crackers. He initially has <fact4>3 plates</fact4>, each holding 42 crackers, for a total of 3 * 42 = 126 crackers.  Combined, the bowls and plates could hold 189 + 126 = 315 crackers.

After <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>, the total capacity is reduced by 2 * 42 = 84 crackers. The new capacity is 315 - 84 = 231 crackers.

Benjamin starts with <fact2>720 crackers</fact2> and eats <fact6>one-eighth</fact6> of them, which is 720 / 8 = 90 crackers.  This leaves him with 720 - 90 = 630 crackers.

To determine how many more bowls are needed, we find out how many bowls would be required to hold all 630 remaining crackers.  Each bowl holds <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, so the number of bowls needed is 630 / 21 = 30 bowls.

Finally, subtract the number of bowls Benjamin already has (<fact3>9 bowls</fact3>) from the number of bowls needed (30 bowls): 30 - 9 = 21.  Therefore, Benjamin needs 21 more bowls.

How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Uma and Zahra have a combined total of <fact2>29</fact2> + <fact3>37</fact3> = 66 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>130 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 130 - 66 = 64 signatures in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Uma's collection rate will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6> due to collecting only on weekends. Over <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, this means she will collect 4 * (her current average - 5) signatures.  We don't know Uma's current average weekly collection rate, but it can be calculated by dividing the number of signatures she has by the number of weeks: 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. So she will collect approximately 4 * (4.83 - 5) = -0.68 signatures (we can round this to 0 because you can't collect a negative number of signatures).

Therefore, Zahra needs to collect the remaining 64 signatures herself, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.  To achieve this, she will need to collect 64 / <fact4>4</fact4> = 16 signatures per week.

Answer:  First, we need to determine how many plants Haruka can fit in her flower bed.  Each plant, including the spacing, takes up <fact2>3 meters</fact2> + <fact3>13 meters</fact3> = 16 meters.  The total length of the flower bed is <fact1>117 meters</fact1>. Therefore, she can fit 117 meters / 16 meters/plant = 7.3125 plants. Since she can only have a whole number of plants, she can fit 7 plants.

Haruka already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 7 plants - 6 plants = 1 plant.

Since she is buying only 1 plant, the cost is simply €8 (she doesn't qualify for the discount because she is not buying more than <fact5>2 plants</fact5>). Therefore, Haruka will spend €8 at the store.

During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, Mei and Haruka compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Mei has <fact2>24 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Haruka has <fact3>51 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>3 more weeks</fact4> of summer break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, Mei is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Haruka decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Haruka need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Mei and Haruka have a combined total of <fact2>24</fact2> + <fact3>51</fact3> = 75 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> by the end of summer break. This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 75 = 60 signatures in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.

Mei's current weekly collection rate is implied by the fact that she has collected <fact2>24 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, or an average of 24/5 = 4.8 signatures per week.  Because she'll only collect signatures on weekends during the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, her weekly collection will be reduced by <fact6>5</fact6>, to 4.8 - 5 = -0.2 signatures per week. This means Mei will actually *lose* 0.2 signatures per week; we can ignore the negative value because she can't collect a negative number of signatures.  Therefore, for all practical purposes, Mei will collect 0 signatures during the remaining 3 weeks.

Therefore, Haruka needs to collect all 60 remaining signatures herself over the <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  To achieve this, she needs to collect 60 / <fact4>3</fact4> = 20 signatures per week.

Zahra's flowers grow <fact2>4 feet wide</fact2> so she needs to leave <fact3>12 feet</fact3> between every plant (including the plants width). Zahra already owns <fact4>5 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₣13</fact5> at the store. However, if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she'll receive a <fact7>₣5 discount</fact7> on the entire purchase. How much money will Zahra spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer:  The total space needed for each plant, including the spacing between them, is <fact2>4 feet</fact2> (plant width) + <fact3>12 feet</fact3> (spacing) = 16 feet.  The <fact1>144-foot-long</fact1> flower bed can therefore accommodate 144 feet / 16 feet/plant = 9 plants.  Since Zahra already owns <fact4>5 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy an additional 9 - 5 = 4 plants. Because she is buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she will receive the <fact7>₣5 discount</fact7>. The cost of 4 plants without discount would be 4 plants * <fact5>₣13/plant</fact5> = ₣52.

During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, Uma and Olga compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Uma has <fact2>25 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Olga has <fact3>59 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>2 more weeks</fact4> of summer break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Olga decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Olga need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Uma has <fact2>25 signatures</fact2> and Olga has <fact3>59 signatures</fact3>, totaling 25 + 59 = 84 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> by the end of the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> remaining.  This means they need to collect 140 - 84 = 56 more signatures.

During the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Uma's weekly collection is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>.  Therefore, over the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Uma will collect 2 * (Uma's current weekly collection - <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>).  We don't know Uma's current weekly collection, but we know that after <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, she has <fact2>25 signatures</fact2>. We will need to assume that Uma collected roughly the same number of signatures each week thus far. Therefore, Uma's current weekly collection can be estimated as 25/3 ≈ 8.33 signatures per week.  Over the next two weeks she will collect approximately 2 * (8.33 - 5) = 6.66 signatures. We will round this down to 6 signatures since Uma can only collect signatures on weekends.

Olga needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach the goal.  Therefore, Olga needs to collect 56 (total needed) - 6 (Uma's contribution) = 50 signatures in the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.  To achieve this, Olga needs to collect 50 / <fact4>2</fact4> = 25 signatures per week.

Therefore, Olga will need to collect 25 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy <fact2>16 kgs at €22 per kg</fact2>, get <fact3>4 kgs 1/4 off</fact3>."" She scooped up <fact4>22 kgs</fact4>. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for <fact5>€11.0</fact5> and <fact6>12 keychains</fact6> that were <fact7>€20.0 each</fact7>. Sakura then donated <fact8>€5</fact8> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Sakura have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy.  Sakura bought <fact4>22 kgs</fact4>. The offer was for <fact2>16 kgs at €22 per kg</fact2>, so that's 16 * €22 = €352.  The discount applied to the additional <fact4>22-16=6 kgs</fact4>. The discount is <fact3>1/4 off</fact3>, which is €22 * 0.25 = €5.50 per kg. So the discount on the extra 6 kgs is 6 * €5.50 = €33.  Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is €352 + (6 * €22) - €33 = €352 + €132 - €33 = €451.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the keychains:  She bought <fact6>12 keychains</fact6> at <fact7>€20.0 each</fact7>, costing 12 * €20 = €240.

The total spent on gifts is the cost of the taffy (€451), starfish (€<fact5>11.0</fact5>), and keychains (€240): €451 + €11 + €240 = €702.

Adding the charity donation (€<fact8>5</fact8>), Sakura's total spending is €702 + €5 = €707.

Finally, subtracting her total spending from the initial amount given by her parents (€<fact1>1300</fact1>), we find out how much money she has left: €1300 - €707 = €593.

Therefore, Sakura has €593 left.

Reformatted Question: Faisal watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Wednesday and Thursday, he watched <fact1>4-hour episodes</fact1> of his favorite show each night. On Friday, he watched a few episodes of a <fact2>30-minute</fact2> show. On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3> and a <fact4>15-minute</fact4> show. On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four <fact5>3-hour episodes</fact5>. On Monday, he watched three episodes, each <fact6>45 minutes</fact6>. If he watched <fact7>28 hours</fact7> of TV in all, how many <fact2>30-minute</fact2> episodes did he watch on Friday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Wednesday to Monday excluding Friday:

* **Wednesday:** 4 hours
* **Thursday:** 4 hours
* **Saturday:** 5 hours + (15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 5.25 hours
* **Sunday:** 4 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 12 hours
* **Monday:** 3 episodes * (45 minutes/episode / 60 minutes/hour) = 2.25 hours

Total time (excluding Friday): 4 + 4 + 5.25 + 12 + 2.25 = 27.5 hours

Now, subtract this from the total TV time for the week (<fact7>28 hours</fact7>): 28 hours - 27.5 hours = 0.5 hours.

This 0.5 hours is the time spent watching the 30-minute show on Friday.  Since each episode is <fact2>30 minutes</fact2> (or 0.5 hours), Faisal watched 0.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 1 episode on Friday. The answer is {1}.

**Answer:**

1. **Students who hike:** The number of students who like to hike is <fact8>5 less than twice the number</fact8> who like to play <fact5>cricket</fact5>.  Since <fact5>39 students like cricket</fact5>, twice that number is 39 * 2 = 78. Five less than that is 78 - 5 = 73 students. So, <fact7>73 students like to hike</fact7>.

2. **Students with other hobbies:** The total number of students with hobbies other than video games and hiking is <fact2>12 (painting)</fact2> + <fact3>8 (chess)</fact3> + <fact4>13 (swimming)</fact4> + <fact5>39 (cricket)</fact5> = 72 students.

3. **Students who play video games or hike:** The total number of students is <fact1>290</fact1>. Subtracting the students with other hobbies (72) leaves 290 - 72 = 218 students who either play video games or hike.

4. **Students who play video games:**  Since 73 students like to <fact7>hike</fact7>, and 218 students <fact6>play video games or hike</fact6>, the number of students who play video games is 218 - 73 = 145 students.

5. **Percentage of students who play video games:**  The percentage of students who <fact6>play video games</fact6> is (145 students / <fact1>290 total students</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.

Therefore, 50% of the students like to play video games. The answer is {50}.

Answer: 
A <fact1>d4 die</fact1> has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For the first scenario (<fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>):
* The numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, and 4.  So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4.
* The probability of this happening twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

For the second scenario (<fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>):
* The odd numbers on a d4 are 1 and 3. So there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2.
* The probability of this happening four times in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

To express the difference in percentage points, we convert the probabilities to percentages:
* Probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row: (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%
* Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%

The difference is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points. The answer is {50}.

How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

Ava collected <fact2>30 signatures</fact2> in <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, meaning she collected 30 / 3 = 10 signatures per week.  Her collection rate will decrease by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6> for the next <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, so she'll collect 10 - 5 = 5 signatures per week. Over the remaining <fact4>two weeks</fact4>, Ava will collect 5 * 2 = 10 more signatures.

Currently, they have <fact2>30</fact2> + <fact3>37</fact3> = 67 signatures.  Adding Ava's projected 10 additional signatures, they'll have 67 + 10 = 77 signatures.

They want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> total. This means they need 135 - 77 = 58 more signatures.  Since Quinn is the only one collecting during the next two weeks, she needs to collect 58 signatures.

Therefore, Quinn needs to collect 58 / <fact4>2</fact4> = 29 signatures per week to reach their goal. The answer is {29}.

Since 8 muffins qualifies for the <fact4>6 muffins or more</fact4> promotion, the cost of <fact7>8 muffins</fact7> is reduced by <fact5>10%</fact5>.  The discount is $1.25 * <fact7>8</fact7> * <fact5>0.10</fact5> = $1.00. Thus, <fact7>8 muffins</fact7> cost $1.25 * <fact7>8</fact7> - $1.00 = $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

<fact6>Two loaves of sourdough</fact6> cost <fact1>$10</fact1> * <fact6>2</fact6> = $20.00.

The difference in cost between <fact6>two loaves of sourdough</fact6> and <fact7>eight muffins</fact7> is $20.00 - $9.00 = $11.00.

Aisha can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> while Amelia can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> and Ava can eat <fact4>four times as much as Amelia</fact4>. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Ava decides to go on a <fact6>diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?


**Answer:**

Amelia eats <fact3>twice</fact3> as much as Aisha, so Amelia eats <fact2>3</fact2> * 2 = 6 servings a day.  Ava eats <fact4>four times</fact4> as much as Amelia, so Ava eats 6 * 4 = 24 servings a day.

In the <fact5>first 2 days</fact5>, Aisha eats <fact2>3</fact2> servings/day * <fact5>2</fact5> days = 6 servings. Amelia eats 6 servings/day * <fact5>2</fact5> days = 12 servings. Ava eats 24 servings/day * <fact5>2</fact5> days = 48 servings.

Total servings consumed in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>: 6 + 12 + 48 = 66 servings.

Remaining servings: <fact1>87</fact1> - 66 = 21 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Ava eats <fact6>half</fact6> as much, so she eats 24 / 2 = 12 servings a day.

Combined consumption per day after <fact5>2 days</fact5>: 3 (Aisha) + 6 (Amelia) + 12 (Ava) = 21 servings/day.

Days to finish remaining servings: 21 servings / 21 servings/day = 1 day.

However, this week, <fact4>5 apartments from each of the first 4 complexes were vacant</fact4> and did not require collection service. <fact5>Qasim collects garbage 2 times a week from each place</fact5> and he <fact6>gets paid ₣0.3 per collection for each apartment</fact6>. He also <fact7>earns an additional 10% in tips</fact7>. <fact8>How much money does he make in a week?</fact8>


**Answer:**

1. **Apartments in the last complex:** The first 4 complexes have a total of <fact2>4 * 100 = 400 apartments</fact2>. The last complex is <fact3>30% bigger</fact3>, meaning it has 400 * 0.30 = 120 more apartments than the combined total of the others.  So, the last complex has 400 + 120 = 520 apartments.

2. **Total apartments served this week:**  <fact4>5 apartments were vacant in each of the first 4 complexes</fact4>, for a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vacant apartments.  This means Qasim collected from 400 - 20 = 380 apartments in the first four complexes. Adding the last complex, he served a total of 380 + 520 = 900 apartments this week.

3. **Collections per week:** Qasim collects from each apartment <fact5>twice a week</fact5>, so he makes 900 * 2 = 1800 collections per week.

4. **Base earnings:**  Qasim earns <fact6>₣0.3 per collection</fact6>, so his base earnings are 1800 * ₣0.3 = ₣540.

5. **Tips:** Qasim earns an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>, which is ₣540 * 0.10 = ₣54.

After a <fact6>20% discount</fact6>, she paid a total of <fact7>$1540</fact7>. What was the cost of <fact8>mini cheesecakes per dozen</fact8>?

**Answer:**

1. **Donuts:** Nadia bought <fact1>60 donuts</fact1>, which is <fact1>60</fact1> / 12 = 5 dozens.  At <fact2>$14 per dozen</fact2>, the donuts cost 5 * <fact2>$14</fact2> = $70.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:** Nadia bought <fact3>60 mini cupcakes</fact3>, which is <fact3>60</fact3> / 12 = 5 dozens. At <fact4>$25 per dozen</fact4>, the cupcakes cost 5 * <fact4>$25</fact4> = $125.

3. **Total before discount and cheesecakes:** The cost of donuts and cupcakes combined is $70 + $125 = $195.

4. **Total before discount:**  Since Nadia paid <fact7>$1540</fact7> after a <fact6>20% discount</fact6>, this amount represents 80% of the original price. Therefore, the total cost before the discount was <fact7>$1540</fact7> / 0.80 = $1925.

5. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:** The cost of the <fact5>mini cheesecakes</fact5> is the total before the discount minus the cost of donuts and cupcakes: $1925 - $195 = $1730.

6. **Cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen:** Nadia bought <fact5>24 mini cheesecakes</fact5>, which is <fact5>24</fact5>/ 12 = 2 dozens. Therefore, the cost of <fact8>mini cheesecakes per dozen</fact8> is $1730 / 2 = $865.

    * Spouse: <fact2>16 pizzas</fact2>
    * Grandchild: (<fact1>16</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2>) / 2 = <fact3>16 pizzas</fact3>

What is the least amount Leon can spend on everything?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the school supplies before any discounts.

* **Crayons:** <fact1>8 crayons</fact1> * <fact2>¥7.0/crayon</fact2> = ¥56
* **Notebooks:** <fact3>8 notebooks</fact3> * <fact4>¥13.75/notebook</fact4> = ¥110
* **Bond paper:** <fact5>1 ream</fact5> * <fact6>¥10/ream</fact6> = ¥10
* **Folders:** <fact7>4 folders</fact7> * <fact8>¥11/folder</fact8> = ¥44

Total cost before discount: ¥56 + ¥110 + ¥10 + ¥44 = ¥220

Now let's calculate the cost with the membership discount:

* **Discount:** ¥220 * <fact10>20%</fact10> = ¥44
* **Price after discount:** ¥220 - ¥44 = ¥176
* **Total cost with membership (including fee):** ¥176 + <fact9>¥20</fact9> = ¥196

Next, let's calculate the cost with the non-membership discount:

* **Discount:** ¥220 * <fact11>5%</fact11> = ¥11
* **Total cost without membership:** ¥220 - ¥11 = ¥209

Comparing the two options, the least amount Leon can spend is ¥196 with the membership. The answer is {196}.

Thiago has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact7>1/4 of the remaining cost</fact7> of the science fair. How much money is Thiago still missing?

Answer: The total cost per day is <fact2>$250</fact2> + <fact3>$30</fact3> + <fact4>$30</fact4> = $310.  Since the science fair is <fact1>3 days</fact1> long, the total cost is $310 * <fact1>3</fact1> = $930.  <fact6>Thiago's friends are covering the cost of food</fact6>, which is <fact3>$30</fact3> per day * <fact1>3</fact1> days = $90.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is <fact3>7% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the transfer fee that is <fact4>12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount</fact5> on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

**Answer:**

1. **Discounted Price:** With a <fact5>20% discount</fact5>, the selling price of the house becomes <fact2>$500,000</fact2> * (1 - 0.20) = $400,000.

2. **Brokerage Fee:** The brokerage fee is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.07 = $28,000.

3. **Transfer Fee:** The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.12 = $48,000.

4. **Total Cost:** The total cost of the house, including fees, is the discounted price + brokerage fee + transfer fee: $400,000 + $28,000 + $48,000 = $476,000.

5. **Amount Over Budget:** The total cost exceeds Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$410,000 budget</fact1> by $476,000 - $410,000 = $66,000.

**Answer:**

Chen started with <fact1>$1300</fact1>.

She bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of taffy. The first 16 kgs cost <fact2>$22/kg</fact2>, so that's 16 * <fact2>$22</fact2> = $352.  The remaining 23 - 16 = 7 kgs were 1/4 off, but since the deal is for 6 kgs, she got a discount only on the first 6 kg.  These 6 kgs cost 3/4 * <fact2>$22</fact2> * 6 = $99. The last remaining 1 kg of the 7kg was at normal price and it cost <fact2>$22</fact2> * 1 = $22. Her total taffy cost was $352 + $99 + $22 = $473.

She also spent <fact4>$11</fact4> on starfish and <fact5>11</fact5> * <fact6>$21</fact6> = $231 on keychains.

Finally, she donated <fact7>$5</fact7>.

Therefore, her total spending was $473 + $11 + $231 + $5 = $720.

**Answer:**

1. **First 10 seconds:** <fact1>80 kernels</fact1> popped.
2. **Next 10 seconds:** <fact2>4 times</fact2> the initial amount popped, so 80 * 4 = 320 kernels popped.
3. **Following 10 seconds:** <fact3>6 times</fact3> the initial popping rate (<fact1>80 kernels</fact1>) occurred, meaning 80 * 6 = 480 kernels popped.
4. **Final 10 seconds:** The rate slowed to <fact4>half</fact4> of the previous 10 seconds, so 480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped.

Sanjay <fact5>work overtime on the last day</fact5> so he can respond to <fact6>20% more emails than usual</fact6>.


**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many emails Sanjay receives that *do* require a response each day. Since <fact2>25% don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - 25% = 75% *do* require a response.  So, he needs to respond to 0.75 * <fact1>32 emails</fact1> = 24 emails.

Next, we find out how many of those emails he *can* respond to. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails requiring responses, which is (24 / 2) - <fact3>2</fact3> = 10 emails per day.

For the first three days of his <fact4>four-day work week</fact4>, Sanjay responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

On the last day (<fact5>due to overtime</fact5>), Sanjay responds to <fact6>20% more</fact6> than usual.  This means he responds to an additional 0.20 * 10 emails = 2 emails.  So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails.

The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Kimia have left than Yusuf after they leave the store?


Answer:
Kimia's expenses:

* **Nails:** <fact4>16 nails</fact4> * <fact7>¥0.4/nail</fact7> = ¥6.40
* **Washers:** <fact5>9 washers</fact5> * <fact6>¥0.65/washer</fact6> = ¥5.85
* **Paint:** Since the problem doesn't give a price for Kimia's paint, we'll assume it's the same ¥7.0 as Yusuf's (before discount). So, <fact8>8 gallons</fact8> * ¥7.0/gallon = ¥56.00
* **Total:** ¥6.40 + ¥5.85 + ¥56.00 = ¥68.25
* **Money left:** <fact3>¥91.25</fact3> - ¥68.25 = ¥23.00

Yusuf's expenses:

* **Paint:** <fact10>10 gallons</fact10> * <fact11>¥7.0/gallon</fact11> = ¥70.00.  With the <fact1>member</fact1> <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, the cost is ¥70.00 * 0.90 = ¥63.00

Difference:

Kimia has ¥23.00 left and Yusuf has ¥9.00 left.  Kimia has ¥23.00 - ¥9.00 = ¥14.00 more than Yusuf.

How much were Mr. Martinez's <fact6>net proceeds after two years</fact6>?

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate Total Fees:** Mr. Martinez paid a total of <fact2>3%</fact2> + <fact3>6%</fact3> = 9% of the <fact1>selling price ($690,000)</fact1> in fees. This amounts to 0.09 * <fact1>$690,000</fact1> = $62,100.

2. **Calculate Initial Net Proceeds:**  Subtract the <fact2>transfer fees</fact2>, <fact3>brokerage fee</fact3>, <fact4>loan amount</fact4>, and <fact5>closing costs</fact5> from the <fact1>selling price</fact1> to find the initial <fact6>net proceeds</fact6>: <fact1>$690,000</fact1> - $62,100 - <fact4>$590,000</fact4> - <fact5>$5,000</fact5> = $32,900.

3. **Calculate First Year's Gain:**  The <fact7>stocks gained 10%</fact7> in the first year, so the <fact6>net proceeds</fact6> increased by 0.10 * $32,900 = $3,290.  The total after the first year is $32,900 + $3,290 = $36,190.

Sanjay is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. <fact1>80 pop in the first 26 seconds</fact1> of cooking, then <fact2>4 times that amount</fact2> in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to <fact3>6 times the initial popping rate</fact3> in the next 26 seconds. In the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate</fact4> as the past 26 seconds. After Sanjay takes the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking</fact5> also pop from the residual heat. <fact6>Sanjay gives 1/5 of the made popcorn to his brother Noah</fact6>. <target>How many more pieces of popcorn does Sanjay have to eat than his brother?</target>


**Answer:**

Here's how we can calculate the difference in popcorn amounts:

1. **First 26 seconds:** <fact1>80 kernels</fact1> popped.

2. **Next 26 seconds:** <fact2>4 times</fact2> the initial amount popped, which is 4 * <fact1>80</fact1> = 320 kernels.

3. **Following 26 seconds:**  <fact3>6 times</fact3> the initial popping rate (<fact1>80 kernels</fact1> every 26 seconds), means 6 * <fact1>80</fact1> = 480 kernels popped.

4. **Final 26 seconds:** Popping slowed to <fact4>half the rate</fact4> of the previous 26 seconds, so <fact4>1/2</fact4> * 480 = 240 kernels popped.

5. **Residual heat:** <fact5>A quarter</fact5> of the kernels from the final 26 seconds popped, so <fact5>1/4</fact5> * 240 = 60 kernels popped.

6. **Total popped kernels:** 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180 kernels.

7. **Kernels given to Noah:** Sanjay gave <fact6>1/5</fact6> of the total to Noah, which is (<fact6>1/5</fact6>) * 1180 = 236 kernels.

8. **Kernels Sanjay kept:** 1180 - 236 = 944 kernels.

9. **Difference:** Sanjay has 944 - 236 = 708 more kernels than Noah.

<target>Therefore, Sanjay has 708 more pieces of popcorn to eat than his brother.</target>

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

**Answer:**

Gabrielle saw <fact5>15 bees</fact5>.  She saw <fact1>two-fifths as many wasps</fact1>, which means she saw (2/5) * <fact5>15</fact5> = 6 wasps.

She saw <fact3>half as many rabbits as white animals</fact3>, and there were <fact2>38 white animals</fact2>. So, she saw <fact2>38</fact2> / 2 = 19 rabbits.

The total number of animals is the sum of wasps, bees, rabbits, and caterpillars: 6 + <fact5>15</fact5> + 19 + <fact4>41</fact4> = 81 animals.

The percentage of rabbits is (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100%.  Therefore, the percentage of rabbits is (19 / 81) * 100% ≈ 23.46%.  Rounded to the nearest whole number, the answer is {23}.

Ali has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to <fact8>cover 1/5 of the remaining cost</fact8> of the sports tournament. How much money is Ali still missing?


**Answer:**

1. **Total cost without food:** The cost of the hotel and transportation per day is <fact3>₣200</fact3> + <fact5>₣10</fact5> = ₣210.  Since the tournament is <fact1>3 days</fact1> long, the total cost for hotel and transportation is ₣210 * <fact1>3</fact1> = ₣630.

2. **Cost covered by friends:**  Ali's friends are paying for all the <fact4>food</fact4>, which costs <fact4>₣20</fact4> <fact2>per day</fact2> for <fact1>3 days</fact1>, a total of ₣20 * <fact1>3</fact1> = ₣60.  However, this is covered by friends (<fact7>will cover the cost of all the food</fact7>).

3. **Remaining cost before charity:**  Since Ali's friends covered all food costs, the remaining cost is ₣630 (calculated in step 1).

4. **Cost covered by charity:** The charity covers <fact8>1/5</fact8> of the remaining ₣630, which is (1/5) * ₣630 = ₣126.

5. **Remaining cost after charity:** After the charity's contribution, Ali still needs ₣630 - ₣126 = ₣504.

6. **Money Ali still needs:** Ali has <fact6>₣40</fact6>.  He still needs ₣504 - <fact6>₣40</fact6> = ₣464.

Therefore, Ali is still missing ₣464.

However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Chen's weekly collection rate during the first <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>.  She collected a total of <fact2>36 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, meaning she averaged <fact2>36</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 7.2 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate how many signatures Chen will collect in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her collection rate is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so she will now collect 7.2 - <fact6>5</fact6> = 2.2 signatures per week. Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, she'll collect 2.2 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 8.8 signatures.  Since signatures must be whole numbers, we round this down to 8 signatures.

Now, let's determine how many signatures they have in total so far.  <fact2>Chen has 36</fact2> and <fact3>Tara has 32</fact3>, totaling <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.

Adding Chen's expected 8 additional signatures from the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, they will have 68 + 8 = 76 signatures.

They want to reach <fact5>140 signatures total</fact5>.  This means Tara needs to collect the remaining <fact5>140</fact5> - 76 = 64 signatures.

Finally, since Tara has <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> left, she needs to collect 64 / <fact4>4</fact4> = 16 signatures per week to meet their goal.

The answer is {16}.

How much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?


Answer:
The space each plant will take up in Kimia's flower bed is the width of the plant plus the required space between the plants. Therefore, each plant needs <fact2>7 feet</fact2> (the width) + <fact3>14 feet</fact3> (the space) = 21 feet.

Kimia's flower bed is <fact1>126 feet long</fact1>, so she can fit <fact1>126 feet</fact1> / 21 feet/plant = 6 plants.

Since Kimia already has <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 6 plants total - <fact4>6 flowers</fact4> she already owns = 0 plants from the store.

Because she doesn't need to buy any more plants, Kimia will spend ₣0.  The answer is {0}.

**Answer:**

The total cost for the hotel over the <fact1>2-day</fact1> workshop is <fact1>2</fact1> days * <fact2>¥150/day</fact2> = ¥300.

The total cost for food is <fact1>2</fact1> days * <fact3>¥30/day</fact3> = ¥60, but Leon's <fact6>friends are covering this cost</fact6>, so Leon doesn't have to pay for it.

The total transportation cost is <fact1>2</fact1> days * <fact4>¥10/day</fact4> = ¥20.

So, the total cost of the workshop excluding food is ¥300 (hotel) + ¥20 (transportation) = ¥320.

Leon currently has <fact5>¥155</fact5>.

The remaining cost after Leon's contribution is ¥320 - <fact5>¥155</fact5> = ¥165.

**Answer:**

1. **Initial unoccupied rooms:** The clinic has a capacity of <fact1>1600 rooms</fact1>.  <fact2>One-tenth (1/10)</fact2> are occupied, meaning 1600 * (1/10) = 160 rooms are occupied.  <fact3>Two-fifths (2/5)</fact3> are out of service, meaning 1600 * (2/5) = 640 rooms are out of service. Initially, the number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>1600</fact1> - 160 - 640 = 800.

2. **Rooms occupied after 3 weeks:**  There are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.  <fact4>30 patients</fact4> are admitted each day, so 21 days * <fact4>30 patients/day</fact4> = 630 new patients are admitted.

3. **Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:** We assume each patient occupies one room. After 3 weeks, the number of occupied rooms will be 160 (initially occupied) + 630 (newly admitted) = 790 rooms.  The number of unoccupied serviceable rooms will be 1600 - 640 (out of service) - 790 (occupied) = 170 rooms. 

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms (including those out of service) after 3 weeks is 170 (serviceable unoccupied) + 640 (out of service) = 810 rooms.

On the sidewalk, Keisha walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach.

If <fact6>51 minutes</fact6> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 33-mile walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Before her injury, it took Keisha <fact6>51 minutes</fact6> to walk <fact2>17 miles</fact2> on the beach.  Because her speed has decreased by half (<fact5>), it now takes her twice as long to walk the same distance on the beach. So, it takes her <fact6>51</fact6> * 2 = 102 minutes to walk the <fact2>17 miles</fact2> on the beach.

Since Keisha walks at two times the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach (<fact4>), before the injury, the 16 miles on the sidewalk would have taken half the time it took her to walk the 17 miles on the beach.  With her injury, it takes her 102 minutes to walk the 17 miles on the beach. So, before the injury, it would have taken her 102/2=51 minutes to walk 17 miles on the beach. Because her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, it would have taken her 51/2=25.5 minutes to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk. Since her speed has decreased by half due to her injury, it now takes her 25.5 * 2 = 51 minutes to walk the <fact3>16 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk.

The total time it takes Keisha to complete her walk is the time spent on the beach plus the time spent on the sidewalk. Therefore, it takes her 102 + 51 = 153 minutes to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer:
Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (48:10)</fact1>, we have s/w = 48/10. This simplifies to w = (10/48)s = (5/24)s.

From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (6 tablespoons for every 10 cups)</fact2>, we have m/w = 6/10. This means m = (3/5)w. Substituting the expression for 'w' in terms of 's', we get m = (3/5)*(5/24)s = (1/8)s.

From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1. So, c = 2s.

We are given that <fact4>the total quantity of ingredients used is 210</fact4>. Therefore, s + w + m + c = 210. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get:
s + (5/24)s + (1/8)s + 2s = 210

Multiplying throughout by 24 to eliminate fractions:
24s + 5s + 3s + 48s = 5040
70s = 5040
s = 5040 / 70
s = 72

Therefore, Olga used 72 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is {72}.

The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Valeria have left than Viktor after they leave the store?

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Valeria's total spending.  She buys <fact4>15 anchors</fact4> at <fact7>₣0.35</fact7> each, costing her 15 * 0.35 = ₣5.25.  Her <fact5>8 nails</fact5> cost her 8 * <fact6>₣0.64</fact6> = ₣5.12. We don't know the price of paint for non-members like Valeria, so we'll leave that as 8P (where P is the price per gallon).  Her total spending is 5.25 + 5.12 + 8P = 10.37 + 8P.  Subtracting this from her starting amount (<fact3>₣97.37</fact3>), Valeria has 97.37 - (10.37 + 8P) = 87 - 8P left.

Now, let's calculate Viktor's spending. He buys <fact10>10 gallons of paint</fact10> at <fact11>₣7.0</fact11> each, totaling 10 * 7.0 = ₣70.  Since Viktor <fact1>is a member</fact1>, he receives a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, making the paint cost 70 * 0.9 = ₣63. His <fact12>4 pencils</fact12> cost him 4 * <fact13>₣2</fact13> = ₣8. His total spending is 63 + 8 = ₣71.  Subtracting this from his starting amount (<fact9>₣90</fact9>), Viktor has 90 - 71 = ₣19 left.

We are asked how much *more* Valeria has than Viktor.  This is (87 - 8P) - 19 = 68 - 8P.  Since we don't know the price of the paint, we cannot determine the exact difference. 
 * **If we assume the price of paint is the same for members and non-members (₣7),** Valeria's paint costs 8*<fact11>7</fact11> = ₣56. Thus, Valeria would have 87-56 = ₣31 left. The difference would be 31 - 19 = ₣12.
 * **However, it is plausible that the member discount also applies to the base cost of the paint, meaning the original price could be higher than ₣7.** This would change both calculations.

Without the price of paint for non-members, we cannot definitively answer the question.

Haruka's flowers grow <fact2>3 meters wide</fact2>, so she needs to leave <fact3>13 meters</fact3> between every plant (including the plant's width). Haruka already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>€8</fact5> at the store. However, if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she'll receive a <fact7>€9 discount</fact7> on the entire purchase. How much money will Haruka spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?


Answer:
The space each plant will occupy in the flower bed is the width of the plant (<fact2>3 meters</fact2>) plus the space between plants (<fact3>13 meters</fact3>), which is 3 + 13 = 16 meters.

The flower bed is <fact1>117 meters long</fact1>, so it can hold 117 / 16 = 7 plants with some space left over (5 meters, which isn't enough for another plant).

Haruka already has <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. Since she can fit 7 plants and needs 1 more, she only needs to buy 7 - 6 = 1 plant from the store.

Since she's buying only 1 plant, which is not more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she doesn't get the <fact7>€9 discount</fact7>.

Therefore, she'll spend 1 plant * <fact5>€8/plant</fact5> = €8 at the store.  The answer is {8}.

Quinn has <fact3>₣98.39</fact3> and wants to buy <fact4>17 nuts</fact4> from a bin at the store. She also needs <fact5>9 anchors</fact5>, each costing <fact6>₣0.68</fact6>. Each nut costs <fact7>₣0.31</fact7>. Additionally, Quinn picks up <fact8>8 gallons of paint</fact8>. Faisal starts with <fact9>₣80</fact9> and wants <fact10>10 gallons of paint</fact10>, each priced at <fact11>₣7.0</fact11>, and <fact12>3 carpenter pencils</fact12>, each costing <fact13>₣2</fact13>. The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Quinn have left than Faisal after they leave the store?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Quinn's total spending.  The cost of the nuts is <fact4>17 nuts</fact4> * <fact7>₣0.31/nut</fact7> = ₣5.27. The cost of the anchors is <fact5>9 anchors</fact5> * <fact6>₣0.68/anchor</fact6> = ₣6.12. We don't know the price of paint, so we can't calculate Quinn's paint cost yet.  However, her spending on nuts and anchors is ₣5.27 + ₣6.12 = ₣11.39. Subtracting this from her initial amount, <fact3>₣98.39</fact3>, leaves her with ₣98.39 - ₣11.39 = ₣87.00 before buying paint.

Next, let's calculate Faisal's spending. Faisal's paint would cost <fact10>10 gallons</fact10> * <fact11>₣7.0/gallon</fact11> = ₣70.00. However, because Faisal is <fact1>a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, so the paint actually costs ₣70.00 * (1 - 0.10) = ₣63.00. The cost of the pencils is <fact12>3 pencils</fact12> * <fact13>₣2/pencil</fact13> = ₣6.  His total spending is ₣63.00 + ₣6.00 = ₣69.00. Starting with <fact9>₣80.00</fact9>, Faisal has ₣80.00 - ₣69.00 = ₣11.00 left.

The question does not provide the price of paint for non-members like Quinn.  Therefore, we cannot determine exactly how much money Quinn has left after buying paint and consequently can't determine how much more she has than Faisal. We can only say that before buying paint, Quinn has ₣87.00, which is ₣76.00 more than Faisal's remaining ₣11.00.  However, the question asks about the amounts after *leaving* the store, which presumably means after Quinn buys paint as well.


**Partial Answer (due to missing information):** Before buying paint, Quinn has ₣76.00 more than Faisal.  Without the price of paint for Quinn, we cannot calculate the final difference.

The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Gabrielle have left than Arash after they leave the store?


Answer:
Gabrielle's expenses:

* **Nails:** <fact4>15 nails</fact4> * <fact7>€0.21/nail</fact7> = €3.15
* **Washers:** <fact5>8 washers</fact5> * <fact6>€0.64/washer</fact6> = €5.12
* **Paint:**  Since the price of paint isn't given, we can't calculate this part of Gabrielle's cost. We'll assume the cost of her paint is 'x'.

Gabrielle's total expenses: €3.15 + €5.12 + x = €8.27 + x
Gabrielle's remaining money: <fact3>€92.27</fact3> - (€8.27 + x) = €84 - x

Arash's expenses:

* **Pencils:** <fact12>3 pencils</fact12> * <fact13>€3/pencil</fact13> = €9
* **Paint:** <fact10>12 gallons</fact10> * <fact11>€7.5/gallon</fact11> = €90.  Since <fact1>Arash is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>: €90 * 0.10 = €9 discount.  So, Arash pays €90 - €9 = €81 for the paint.

Arash's total expenses: €9 + €81 = €90
Arash's remaining money: <fact9>€100</fact9> - €90 = €10

Difference in remaining money: (€84 - x) - €10 = €74 - x

Since the price of Gabrielle's paint is not provided, we can only express the difference in their remaining money as €74 - x, where 'x' is the cost of Gabrielle's 8 gallons of paint.  If the price of Gabrielle's paint were given, we could calculate a numerical answer.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$980</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>muffins per dozen</fact3>?

**Answer:**

Ava bought <fact1>36 eclairs</fact1>, which is <fact1>36</fact1>/12 = 3 dozens. The cost of the eclairs was 3 dozens * <fact1>$13/dozen</fact1> = $39.  She also bought <fact2>60 cookies</fact2>, which is <fact2>60</fact2>/12 = 5 dozens.  The cost of the cookies was 5 dozens * <fact2>$26/dozen</fact2> = $130.

Let 'm' be the price of a dozen muffins. Ava bought <fact3>24 muffins</fact3>, which is <fact3>24</fact3>/12 = 2 dozens. The cost of the muffins was 2 * m.

The total cost before the discount was $39 + $130 + 2m = $169 + 2m.  Ava received a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, so she paid 80% of the original price. This means 0.8 * ($169 + 2m) = <fact5>$980</fact5>.

$135.20 + 1.6m = $980
1.6m = $980 - $135.20
1.6m = $844.80
m = $844.80 / 1.6
m = $528

Therefore, the cost of muffins per dozen was $528.

**Answer:**

1. **Size of the fifth complex:** The first four complexes have a total of <fact2>4 * 100 = 400 apartments</fact2>. The fifth complex is <fact3>50% bigger</fact3>, so it has 400 * 0.50 = 200 more apartments than the combined size of the others. Thus, the fifth complex has 400 + 200 = 600 apartments.

2. **Total apartments serviced (excluding vacancies):**  The first four complexes have <fact4>100 - 6 = 94 occupied apartments each</fact4>, for a total of 94 * 4 = 376 apartments. Adding the fifth complex, Oliver services 376 + 600 = 976 apartments in total.

How much money will Zahra spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer:
The total space required for each plant, including the space between plants, is the plant's width (<fact2>4 feet</fact2>) plus the required spacing (<fact3>12 feet</fact3>), totaling <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>12</fact3> = 16 feet.

How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Uma's average weekly signature collection rate during the first <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>. She collected <fact2>29 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>, meaning she collected 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week.

Next, we determine how many signatures Uma will collect during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Due to her reduced collection ability, she will collect 4.83 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.17 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we can assume she collects 0 signatures in the last <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her total collected will remain at <fact2>29</fact2>.

Now we calculate how many signatures Zahra needs to collect in total.  Together they want <fact5>130</fact5> signatures, and Uma will have <fact2>29</fact2>, so Zahra needs to collect 130 - 29 = 101 signatures in total.

Finally, we figure out Zahra's required weekly collection rate.  She already has <fact3>37</fact3> signatures, so she needs to collect an additional 101 - 37 = 64 signatures over the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. This means she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

**Answer:**

Theo's daily calorie target is <fact5>250 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3750 calories.  He has a net calorie consumption of <fact6>1100 calories</fact6> - <fact7>150 calories</fact7> = 950 calories. This means he can still consume 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.

Sakura's daily calorie target is <fact8>130 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 1950 calories. She has consumed <fact9>900 calories</fact9> + <fact10>175 calories</fact10> = 1075 calories. This means she can still consume 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Each serving of cookies has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a bag contains <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, totaling 175 * 5 = 875 calories per bag.  Since a bag is <fact2>125 oz</fact2>, each serving is 125 oz / 5 servings = 25 oz.

Theo can consume 2800 more calories, so he can eat 2800 calories / 175 calories/serving = 16 servings of cookies. This translates to 16 servings * 25 oz/serving = 400 oz of cookies.  Since a bag is 125 oz, this is more cookies than we have information for.  So we focus on how much he *can* eat from what is available: 125 oz.

Sakura can consume 875 more calories, which is exactly the number of calories in a <fact2>125 oz</fact2> bag of cookies (<fact3>5 servings</fact3> at <fact1>175 calories/serving</fact1>). Therefore, Sakura can eat 125 oz of cookies.

The difference in the amount of cookies they can consume is 125 oz (Theo) - 125 oz (Sakura) = 0 oz.


Thus, from the available bag of cookies, Theo can consume exactly the same amount as Sakura can, so Theo needs to consume 0 more oz of cookies than Sakura. The answer is {0}.

Mia recently bought <fact7>a tube of bouncy balls</fact7>, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to <fact8>320</fact8>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>42 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>8 stuffed animals</fact2> = 50 items. 
Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. So, there are 2 * 50 = 100 action figures.
Next, we find the total number of crayons in the crayon box, which is <fact4>12 different colors of crayon</fact4>. 
We also find the total number of stickers in the sticker book, which is <fact5>6 pages, each with 11 stickers</fact5>. So, there are 6 * 11 = 66 stickers.
We also know that <fact6>the tower of stacking rings has 25 multicolored rings on it</fact6>.
Now, we add up the total number of items Mia had before buying the bouncy balls: 42 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 100 action figures + 12 crayons + 66 stickers + 25 rings = 253 items.
Since Mia now has a total of <fact8>320 items</fact8>, the number of bouncy balls she bought is 320 - 253 = 67.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: There are <fact2>1/2</fact2> * <fact1>240</fact1> = 120 golf balls. Of those, <fact3>half</fact3> are orange, so there are 120 / 2 = 60 orange golf balls. Since <fact4>1/2 of those are marked</fact4>, there are 60 / 2 = 30 marked orange golf balls.

There are also <fact1>240</fact1> - 120 = 120 tennis balls. Of those, <fact5>1/7 are green</fact5>, so there are 120 / 7 = 17.14 (round down to 17 since you can't have a fraction of a ball) green tennis balls.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses <fact3>3 pounds of sugar per day</fact3>.

Yusuf also decides to buy himself a cookie for <fact6>€3</fact6>. How much does Yusuf have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€10</fact1> + (<fact1>€10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = €12 per pound.

Yusuf uses <fact3>3 pounds of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>45% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Yusuf will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discount is <fact4>45%</fact4> of €12 * 10 = €120, which is €54. So, the cost of the first 10 pounds is €120 - €54 = €66.

For the remaining 11 pounds, Yusuf will pay the regular price of €12 per pound, which is €12 * 11 = €132.

The total cost of the sugar is €66 + €132 = €198.

Adding the cost of the cookie, <fact6>€3</fact6>, the total amount Yusuf has to pay is €198 + €3 = €201.

On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>18</fact2> - <fact2>18</fact2>/<fact4>3</fact4> = 12 remoras left. The total length of these remoras is 12 * <fact3>19 inches</fact3> = 228 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 228 inches / 12 = 19 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>7 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>7 inches</fact7> = 42 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 42 inches / 12 = 3.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the percentage is (19 feet / <fact1>38 feet</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 50%. For the second dolphin, the percentage is (3.5 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 35%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (50% + 35%) / 2 = 42.5%.

How many ounces of water does Arash have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. The giant cubes use <fact2>13 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> = 117 ounces. The medium cubes use <fact3>3 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9> = 45 ounces. The small cubes use <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces. Since the tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 1/4 of an ounce per cube. We know that Arash makes <fact6>50 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>50</fact6> - <fact7>9</fact7> - <fact8>14</fact8> - <fact9>15</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. The tiny cubes use 1/4 of an ounce per cube * 12 tiny cubes = 3 ounces. The total amount of water used is 117 + 45 + 7 + 3 = 172 ounces. Since Arash started with <fact1>300 ounces of water</fact1>, he has 300 - 172 = 128 ounces of water left.

If the <fact6>cupcake cost $7</fact6> and the <fact7>pomegranate pie cost $25</fact7>, what was Santiago's average daily earning?

Answer: On Sunday, Santiago sold <fact1>22 boxes of cupcakes</fact1> and <fact4>22</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 7 boxes of pomegranate pie. On Monday, he sold <fact1>22</fact1> + <fact3>11</fact3> = 33 boxes of cupcakes and <fact4>22 boxes of pomegranate pie</fact4>. On Tuesday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, which is (22 + 7) + (33 + 22) = 84 boxes total. Since the total number of boxes sold on Sunday and Monday is 22 + 7 + 33 + 22 = 84, on Tuesday he must have sold 22 + 7 + 33 + 22 = 84 boxes, which is 22 + 33 = 55 boxes of cupcakes and 7 + 22 = 29 boxes of pomegranate pie. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes sold is 22 + 33 + 55 = 110, and the total number of pomegranate pies sold is 7 + 22 + 29 = 58. The total amount of money earned is 110 x <fact6>$7</fact6> + 58 x <fact7>$25</fact7> = $770 + $1450 = $2220. The average daily earning is $2220 / 3 = $740.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺10</fact1> + (<fact1>₺10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ₺12 per pound.

Luis uses <fact3>3 pounds of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>15% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Luis will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discount is <fact4>15%</fact4> of ₺12 * 10 = ₺120, which is ₺18. So, the cost of the first 10 pounds is ₺120 - ₺18 = ₺102.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, the amount of water used is <fact7>11 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>15 ounces per cube</fact2> = 165 ounces. For medium cubes, the amount of water used is <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>6 ounces</fact3> = 72 ounces. For small cubes, the amount of water used is <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 0.25 ounces per cube. We know that Jamal makes <fact6>49 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>49 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>11 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. The amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces per cube = 3 ounces. The total amount of water used is 165 + 72 + 7 + 3 = 247 ounces.

The pomegranates can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apples does Ravi harvest than pomegranates?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many apples Ravi can harvest in 2 years. Since Ravi can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest 2 times a year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 2 * 2 = 4 times. 
Since there are <fact2>21 apples per 3/4 of a square yard</fact2>, there are 21 / (3/4) = 28 apples per square yard. 
So, Ravi can harvest 28 * <fact1>35 square yards</fact1> = 980 apples each time. 
In <fact7>two years</fact7>, Ravi can harvest 980 * 4 = 3920 apples. 
Next, we need to find out how many pomegranates Ravi can harvest in 2 years. Since Ravi can harvest his pomegranates every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, he can harvest 3 times a year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 3 * 2 = 6 times. 
Since there are <fact5>12 pomegranates per square yard</fact5>, Ravi can harvest 12 * <fact4>9 square yards</fact4> = 108 pomegranates each time. 
In <fact7>two years</fact7>, Ravi can harvest 108 * 6 = 648 pomegranates. 
Finally, we subtract the number of pomegranates from the number of apples to find the difference. 3920 - 648 = 3272.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of green tiles. Since there are <fact2>two times as many green tiles</fact2> as white tiles, and there are <fact1>9 white tiles</fact1>, there must be 2 x <fact1>9</fact1> = 18 green tiles.

Now, we know that there are <fact1>9 white tiles</fact1> and 18 green tiles, so the total number of non-orange tiles is <fact1>9</fact1> + 18 = 27.

Since there are <fact3>45 tiles in the stack in total</fact3>, the number of orange tiles must be <fact3>45</fact3> - 27 = 18.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. There were originally <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/6 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>18</fact2> - <fact2>18</fact2>/<fact4>6</fact4> = 15 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>16 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 15 * <fact3>16 inches</fact3> = 240 inches. Since the shark is <fact1>40 feet long</fact1>, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet: 240 inches / 12 = 20 feet. 

The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is (20 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.

For the second shark, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>8 inches</fact7> = 48 inches. Converting to feet, we get 48 inches / 12 = 4 feet. 

The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is (4 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 40%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (50% + 40%) / 2 = 45%.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥15</fact1> + (<fact1>¥15</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ¥18 per kg.

Tariq uses <fact3>3 kgs of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of flour.

The store has a <fact4>15% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Tariq will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is ¥18/kg * <fact4>0.15</fact4> = ¥2.70 per kg. The cost of the first 20 kgs is ¥18/kg - ¥2.70/kg = ¥15.30 per kg.

The total cost of the first 20 kgs is ¥15.30/kg * 20 kgs = ¥306.

The remaining 1 kg (21 kgs - 20 kgs) will be sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.

The total cost of the flour is ¥306 + ¥18 = ¥324.

Tariq can harvest his pears every <fact3>6 months</fact3>. In addition, Tariq owns a <fact4>13-square yard banana field</fact4> that produces <fact5>18 bananas per square yard</fact5>. The bananas can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more pears does Tariq harvest than bananas?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pears Tariq can harvest in two years. Since there are <fact2>16 pears per one-eighth of a square yard</fact2>, there are 16 * 8 = 128 pears per square yard. With <fact1>15 square yards of pear field</fact1>, Tariq can harvest 128 * 15 = 1920 pears every <fact3>6 months</fact3>. Since there are 12 months in a year, Tariq can harvest pears 12 / 6 = 2 times per year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, Tariq can harvest pears 2 * 2 = 4 times. So, the total number of pears Tariq can harvest in two years is 1920 * 4 = 7680 pears.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bananas Tariq can harvest in two years. With <fact4>13-square yard banana field</fact4> and <fact5>18 bananas per square yard</fact5>, Tariq can harvest 18 * 13 = 234 bananas every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. Since there are 12 months in a year, Tariq can harvest bananas 12 / 4 = 3 times per year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, Tariq can harvest bananas 3 * 2 = 6 times. So, the total number of bananas Tariq can harvest in two years is 234 * 6 = 1404 bananas.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of pears and bananas Tariq can harvest in two years. The difference is 7680 - 1404 = 6276.

On Sunday, Luca is going to sell grapes in <fact5>boxes of 16 grapes each</fact5>. He is going to sell each box for <fact6>$13</fact6>. How much is Luca going to make?

Answer: On Friday, Luca picks <fact3>quadruple the number of grapes he did on Wednesday</fact3>, which is <fact1>58</fact1> * 4 = 232 grapes. 
So, in the past 3 days, Luca picked <fact1>58</fact1> + <fact2>158</fact2> + 232 = 448 grapes. 
On Saturday, he picks <fact4>half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined</fact4>, which is 448 / 2 = 224 grapes. 
In total, Luca picked <fact1>58</fact1> + <fact2>158</fact2> + 232 + 224 = 672 grapes. 
Luca can make 672 / <fact5>16</fact5> = 42 boxes of grapes.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since <fact2>1/4 of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>160</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 40. 
Since <fact3>the rest are golf balls</fact3>, the number of golf balls is <fact1>160</fact1> - 40 = 120. 
Next, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are. Since <fact4>1/10 of the tennis balls are pink</fact4>, the number of pink tennis balls is 40 * <fact4>1/10</fact4> = 4. 
Since <fact5>1/2 of the pink tennis balls are marked</fact5>, the number of marked tennis balls is 4 * <fact5>1/2</fact5> = 2. 
Now, we need to find out how many marked golf balls there are. Since <fact6>half of the golf balls are black</fact6>, the number of black golf balls is 120 * <fact6>1/2</fact6> = 60. 
Since <fact7>all except half of those black balls are marked</fact7>, the number of marked black golf balls is 60 - (60 * <fact7>1/2</fact7>) = 30. 
Therefore, the total number of marked balls is 2 (marked tennis balls) + 30 (marked golf balls) = 32.

Ananya recently bought <fact7>a tube of bouncy balls</fact7>, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to <fact8>290</fact8>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>30 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>5 stuffed animals</fact2> = 35 items.
Then, we can find the number of action figures in the action figure pack. This is 2 * 35 items = <fact3>70 action figures</fact3>.
Next, we can find the total number of crayons and stickers. There are <fact4>12 crayons</fact4> and <fact5>6 pages * 12 stickers per page</fact5> = 72 stickers.
Now, we can find the total number of items Ananya had before buying the bouncy balls. This is 35 blocks and stuffed animals + <fact3>70 action figures</fact3> + <fact4>12 crayons</fact4> + 72 stickers + <fact6>28 stacking rings</fact6> = 217 items.
Since Ananya now has a total of <fact8>290 items</fact8>, the number of bouncy balls she bought is <fact8>290 items</fact8> - 217 items = 73 bouncy balls.

If the <fact6>cookie cost €9</fact6> and the <fact7>grape pie cost €28</fact7>, what was Arjun's average daily earning?

Answer: On Wednesday, Arjun sold <fact1>21 boxes of cookies</fact1> and <fact4>25</fact4> - <fact2>17</fact2> = 8 boxes of grape pie. On Thursday, he sold <fact1>21</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 34 boxes of cookies and <fact4>25</fact4> boxes of grape pie. On Friday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, so he sold 21 + 34 = 55 boxes of cookies and 8 + 25 = 33 boxes of grape pie.

How many ounces of water does Liam have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. The giant cubes use <fact2>14 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> = 112 ounces. The medium cubes use <fact3>6 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 72 ounces. The small cubes use <fact4>1/2 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces. Since the tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 1/4 of an ounce per cube. We know that the total number of cubes is <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. The tiny cubes use 1/4 of an ounce per cube * 12 tiny cubes = 3 ounces. The total amount of water used is 112 + 72 + 7 + 3 = 194 ounces. Therefore, Liam has <fact1>315 ounces of water</fact1> - 194 ounces = 121 ounces of water left.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of pink bricks. Since there are <fact2>two times as many pink bricks</fact2> as white bricks, and there are <fact1>3 white bricks</fact1>, there must be 2 * <fact1>3</fact1> = 6 pink bricks. Now, we know that there are <fact1>3 white bricks</fact1> and 6 pink bricks, so the total number of non-green bricks is <fact1>3</fact1> + 6 = 9 bricks. Since there are <fact4>30 bricks in the building in total</fact4>, the number of green bricks is <fact4>30</fact4> - 9 = 21 bricks. To find the percentage of green bricks, we divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100: (21 / <fact4>30</fact4>) * 100 = 70%. Therefore, 70% of the bricks are green.

If Ava is sure to get <fact5>25% of the economics questions</fact5>, <fact6>30% of the biology questions</fact6>, and <fact7>half of the geography and algebra questions</fact7> correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of questions for each subject. 
The number of biology questions is <fact1>100</fact1> * <fact2>30%</fact2> = 30 questions.
The number of economics questions is <fact1>100</fact1> * <fact3>20%</fact3> = 20 questions.
The number of geography and algebra questions is <fact1>100</fact1> - 30 - 20 = 50 questions. Since they are equally divided, there are 50 / 2 = 25 questions for each subject.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Ava is sure to get correctly.
She will get <fact5>25%</fact5> of 20 economics questions, which is 20 * <fact5>25%</fact5> = 5 questions.
She will get <fact6>30%</fact6> of 30 biology questions, which is 30 * <fact6>30%</fact6> = 9 questions.
She will get <fact7>half</fact7> of 25 geography questions, which is 25 * <fact7>50%</fact7> = 12.5 questions. Since you can't get half a question, we will round down to 12 questions (we could also round up, but the question asks for the number of points she is ""sure"" to get).
She will get <fact7>half</fact7> of 25 algebra questions, which is 25 * <fact7>50%</fact7> = 12.5 questions. Again, we will round down to 12 questions.

In total, Ava is sure to get 5 + 9 + 12 + 12 = 38 questions correctly.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price</fact4>. If Ms. Johnson can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Ms. Johnson's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $600000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$600000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$600000</fact2> - $120000 = $480000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 6% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.06 x <fact2>$600000</fact2> = $36000. The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 x <fact2>$600000</fact2> = $78000.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $480000 + $36000 + $78000 = $594000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Ms. Johnson's <fact1>$480000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $594000 - <fact1>$480000</fact1> = $114000.

Answer: The time it takes them to get to the mall is <fact2>29 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>46 minutes</fact3> = 75 minutes. Since they have to return home and then go back to the mall, the total time spent is 75 * 2 = 150 minutes.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Jasmine had before receiving the new plants.

On the sidewalk, Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach.

If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>14 kilometers</fact3> / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 42 minutes = 102 minutes.

If <fact3>the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?

Answer: To cover 1/4 of the city, the fog bank needs to cover 1/4 * <fact3>80 miles</fact3> = 20 miles. Since <fact1>it takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles</fact1>, the fog bank's original speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes. To cover 20 miles at this speed, it would take 20 miles / (4 miles / 60 minutes) = 300 minutes. However, since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to consider the reduced speed. The fog bank will cover the first 4 miles in 60 minutes, but then the speed will be halved. The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city is 20 - 4 = 16 miles. At the reduced speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance, so it will take 2 * (16 miles / (4 miles / 60 minutes)) = 480 minutes to cover the remaining 16 miles. However, this is not the total time, as the fog bank already covered 4 miles in the first 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city is 60 minutes + 240 minutes (half of 480 minutes, since the speed is halved after 1 hour) = 300 minutes.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of golf balls and tennis balls. The number of golf balls is <fact1>480</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 60. The number of tennis balls is <fact1>480</fact1> - 60 = 420, which is also <fact3>the rest</fact3> of the balls.
Next, we need to find the number of marked golf balls and marked tennis balls. The number of orange golf balls is 60 * <fact4>1/3</fact4> = 20. The number of marked golf balls is 20 * <fact5>1/5</fact5> = 4.
The number of cyan tennis balls is 420 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = 46.67, which we will round down to 46 since we can't have a fraction of a ball. The number of marked tennis balls is 46 * <fact7>9/10</fact7> = 41.4, which we will also round down to 41.
Therefore, the total number of marked balls is 4 + 41 = 45.

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>. Yusuf has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>. How much money is Yusuf still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>2-day seminar</fact1> is <fact2>€250</fact2> * 2 = €500. The cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3> is <fact3>€30</fact3> * 2 = €60, but this is covered by Yusuf's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>2-day seminar</fact1> is <fact4>€20</fact4> * 2 = €40. Therefore, the total cost of the seminar is €500 + €40 = €540. 

Since Yusuf's friends are covering the cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>, Yusuf only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €540. Yusuf has <fact5>€35</fact5>, so he still needs €540 - €35 = €505. 

However, the community center is covering <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>, which is €505 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = €56.11. Therefore, Yusuf still needs €505 - €56.11 = €448.89.

Answer: Haruka received <fact1>40 new potted plants</fact1> and purchased <fact3>160 new plants</fact3> at a 50% discount, which means she got 160 * 0.5 = 80 plants from the purchase.

Yusuf has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>a tenth of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>. How much money is Yusuf still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day seminar</fact1> is <fact2>$100</fact2> * 3 = $300. The cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3> is <fact3>$40</fact3> * 3 = $120, but this is covered by Yusuf's friends. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>3-day seminar</fact1> is <fact4>$10</fact4> * 3 = $30. So, the total cost of the seminar is $300 + $120 + $30 = $450. Since the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3> is covered by Yusuf's friends, Yusuf only needs to pay $300 + $30 = $330. Yusuf has <fact5>$25</fact5>, so he still needs $330 - $25 = $305.

She also uses <fact2>10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's assume that Elena used x sets of the ratio of <fact1>44:11</fact1> for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Then, she used 44x teaspoons of sugar and 11x cups of water. Since she uses <fact2>10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, she used 11x * (10/10) = 11x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, she used 44x * 2 = 88x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>210</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 44x + 11x + 88x + 11x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 154x = 210. Dividing both sides by 154, we get x = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a set). Since x represents the number of sets of the ratio, we multiply x by 44 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 1 * 44 = 44.

Dr. Smith used the net proceeds from selling the house to invest in stocks. The stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Dr. Smith's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Dr. Smith paid <fact2>1% of the selling price</fact2> in legal fees, which is <fact2>0.01</fact2> * <fact1>$730000</fact1> = $7300. He also paid <fact3>5% of the selling price</fact3> in realtor fees, which is <fact3>0.05</fact3> * <fact1>$730000</fact1> = $36500. Adding these fees to the <fact4>$420000 remaining loan amount</fact4> and the <fact5>$20000 closing costs</fact5>, Dr. Smith paid a total of $7300 + $36500 + $420000 + $20000 = $485800.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's current age. Since in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, Ananya will be <fact3>4 times as old as DeShawn is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Ananya's current age + <fact2>8</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1>. 
Solving for Ananya's current age, we get Ananya's current age = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1> - <fact2>8</fact2> = 92 - 8 = 84. 
However, this is Ananya's age in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, so we need to subtract <fact2>8</fact2> from 92 to get Ananya's current age, which is 84. 
Now we know Ananya is currently 84 - <fact2>8</fact2> = 76 years old.
Next, we can find Diego's age. Since <fact4>Deshawn's brother, Diego, is 9 years younger than DeShawn</fact4>, Diego is <fact1>23</fact1> - 9 = 14 years old.
Then, we can find Sophia's age. Since <fact5>Ananya's sister Sophia is 9 years older than Diego</fact5>, Sophia is 14 + 9 = 23 years old.
In <fact6>2 years</fact6>, their ages will be: 
- Deshawn: <fact1>23</fact1> + <fact6>2</fact6> = 25
- Ananya: 76 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 78
- Diego: 14 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 16
- Sophia: 23 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 25
The average of their ages in <fact6>2 years</fact6> will be (25 + 78 + 16 + 25) / 4 = 144 / 4 = 36.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>¥150</fact2> * 2 = ¥300. The cost of the food is <fact3>¥40</fact3> * 2 = ¥80. The cost of the transportation is <fact4>¥30</fact4> * 2 = ¥60. So, the total cost is ¥300 + ¥80 + ¥60 = ¥440. 

However, Xavier's friends will cover the cost of the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, which is ¥80. So, the remaining cost is ¥440 - ¥80 = ¥360. 

The youth club will cover <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>, which is ¥360 / 9 = ¥40. 

Xavier only has <fact5>¥125</fact5>, and he will receive ¥40 from the youth club. So, the total amount of money he has is ¥125 + ¥40 = ¥165.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>₣250 per day</fact2> = ₣750. The total cost of the food for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>₣40 per day</fact3> = ₣120. The total cost of the transportation for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>₣10 per day</fact4> = ₣30. So the total cost of the music festival is ₣750 + ₣120 + ₣30 = ₣900.

The plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With <fact1>65 square meters of apple field</fact1>, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> and <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of apples and plums harvested in two years. The difference is 4225 - 858 = 3367.

Answer: The number of occupied beds is <fact1>1300</fact1> * <fact2>1/6</fact2> = 216.67 beds. Since we can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 216 beds.
