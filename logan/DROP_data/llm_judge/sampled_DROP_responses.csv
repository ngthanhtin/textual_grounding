Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering <fact1>Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1>, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the <fact2>February Revolution of 1917</fact2>. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising.

However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria. How many regions did the popular uprising start in?

Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically.  Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much.

Manfred, however, did not take the field against him until January 1266, when Charles' main army had crossed the Alps. Alarmed by desertions among his followers and fearing further treachery, Manfred sought to bring Charles to battle as swiftly as possible. Charles attempted to turn Manfred's position at Capua by a perilous crossing of the Apennines which wrecked his supply line; but Manfred had intelligence of his move and lay in a strong position across the River Calore, crossed only by one bridge.

Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops.

In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa. How many years were there between the siege of Herceg Novi and Venice taking Vrgorac?

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>the siege of Herceg Novi started on 1 September 1687</fact1>.  It also states that <fact2>Venice took Vrgorac on 26 November 1690</fact2>. From September 1687 to September 1690 is three years.  Therefore, there are three years between the siege of Herceg Novi and Venice taking Vrgorac.

Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.

In January 1944, <fact1>the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino</fact1> and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705.

**Answer:** The passage states that the Broncos ""<fact1>jumped out to a 10-0 lead</fact1>"" before the Rams ""<fact4>responded</fact4>"" with their first score.  This means the Rams were 10 points behind before they scored.  Since touchdowns are worth 6 points and the Broncos scored one touchdown (<fact2>4-yard touchdown run</fact2>) and one field goal (<fact3>49-yard field goal</fact3>), we know field goals are worth 3 points (6 + 3 = 9 + 1 for the extra point after the TD = 10 total points).  Therefore, the Rams were 10 points, or two scores (one touchdown and one field goal),  behind before their first score. While the questions asks how many *scores* behind they were, and since ""score"" can be interpreted as points, the answer is {10}.

The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.

The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the <fact1>29th of November 1920</fact1>. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach.

The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.

Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side. Polin went to see king Francis I of France to obtain troops, which led to the Siege of Nice in August 1543. Polin supervised the wintering of the Ottomans at Toulon. How many more galleys did the Ottoman Empire promise than France?

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>the Ottoman Empire promised 110 galleys</fact1>, while <fact2>France promised 40 galleys</fact2>.  Subtracting the number of galleys promised by France from the number promised by the Ottoman Empire: <fact1>110</fact1> - <fact2>40</fact2> = 70.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of <fact1>25 men</fact1> ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3> from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many fighters did Diaz have with <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3>?

Answer: The passage states that Díaz de Velasco initially had a party of <fact1>25 men</fact1>.  After joining with the advance party at Río Chakal, his force increased to <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3>. The question asks for the number of *fighters*. While the porters and archers likely had some combat capability,  the passage clearly distinguishes between the soldiers (<fact2>49</fact2>) and the porters and archers (<fact3>34</fact3>).  Therefore, considering only the soldiers as confirmed fighters, Díaz had 49 fighters.  If we assume all porters and archers were also fighters, then the total would be 49 + 34 = 83. However, the question doesn't explicitly state that the porters and archers are fighters, hence the more precise answer is {49}.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of second-language speakers from the number of first-language speakers: <fact4>9,827,875</fact4> - <fact5>68,458</fact5> = 9,759,417. Therefore, 9,759,417 more people speak Hungarian as a first language than as a second language.

Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the <fact2>forest</fact2> or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the <fact1>reducciones</fact1> often fell victim to contagious diseases.

Answer: According to the passage, <fact4>44.0%</fact4> of households were married couples living together. Since the total percentage of households cannot exceed 100%, the percentage of households that are not married couples living together can be found by subtracting <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100%.

The second step is to subtract <fact11>56.0%</fact11> from 100%. <fact4>100%</fact4> - <fact11>56.0%</fact11> = <fact12>44.0%</fact12>.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had <fact2>1,025,000</fact2> members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to <fact3>1,200,000</fact3>. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately <fact4>3.5 million</fact4> members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in <fact5>1933</fact5> and <fact6>1935</fact6>, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from <fact7>1933</fact7> to <fact8>November 1936</fact8>. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to <fact9>1.9 million</fact9> by <fact10>1939</fact10>. Nicholas DeWitt gives <fact11>2.307 million</fact11> members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with <fact12>1.535 million</fact12> in 1929 and <fact13>6.3 million</fact13> in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over <fact14>19 million</fact14> members approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many members did the party lose 1933 to 1939?

Answer: According to the passage, the party membership in 1933 was approximately <fact4>3.5 million</fact4> members and in 1939 it was <fact9>1.9 million</fact9> members. To find the number of members lost, we need to subtract the 1939 membership from the 1933 membership. However, the passage does not explicitly state the membership in 1933, but it mentions that the party closed its ranks to new members from <fact7>1933</fact7> to <fact8>November 1936</fact8> and document verifications of membership ensued in <fact5>1933</fact5> and <fact6>1935</fact6>, removing supposedly unreliable members. This suggests that the membership in 1933 was not the actual number of members, but rather the number before the removal of unreliable members. Therefore, the actual number of members lost is the difference between the number of members in 1939 and the number of members before the removal of unreliable members in 1933, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, we can infer that the number of members lost is at least the difference between the number of members in 1933 and the number of members in 1939.",1600000,False,history_2234_a2ea2d15-157c-495e-8078-7634045e0643
