Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne.

The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29th of November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.

San Giuseppe had no choice but to fortify his men in the fort at Dún an Óir. In October 1580, Grey de Wilton with up to 4000 troops arrived at Smerwick and laid siege to the garrison. The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow Dingle Peninsula, cut off by Mount Brandon on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Manfred, however, did not take the field against him until January 1266, when Charles' main army had crossed the Alps. Alarmed by desertions among his followers and fearing further treachery, Manfred sought to bring Charles to battle as swiftly as possible. Charles attempted to turn Manfred's position at Capua by a perilous crossing of the Apennines which wrecked his supply line; but Manfred had intelligence of his move and lay in a strong position across the River Calore, crossed only by one bridge. Charles had divided his cavalry into three ""battles"". The infantry and the first battle, consisting of 900 Provençals were at the front, commanded by Marshal of France Hugh of Mirepoix and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Castres. Behind them were the second battle, which consisted of 400 Italians and 1,000 men of Languedoc and central France. Charles commanded the second battle in person. Behind them, the third battle consisted of about 700 men from the county of Flanders under Constable of France Gilles II de Trasignies and Robert III of Flanders. Manfred had adopted similar dispositions. His Saracen archers were in the fore. Behind them was the first battle, 1,200 German mercenaries armed in coats of plates, commanded by his cousin Giordano d'Anglano and Galvano of Anglona. The second battle consisted of the Italian mercenaries, about 1,000, and 300 Saracen light horse, commanded by his uncle Galvano Lancia.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal.

Answer: According to the passage, there were originally 66 French posts, and over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned. To find the number of posts still there, we need to subtract the number of posts stormed or abandoned from the total number of posts.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich. The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.

""Polish-Soviet War"" is the most common but other names include ""Russo-Polish War of 1919-1921"" and ""Polish-Bolshevik War"". This second term is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred as the ""War of 1920"". There is disagreement over the dates of the war. The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its article with the date range 1919-1920 but then states, ""Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state Józef Piłsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May."" The Polish Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, as well as Western historians such as Norman Davies, consider 1919 the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude. How many years did the Polish-Soviet War last? Answer: Several sources give different dates for the war. One source gives the dates as 1919-1921, which is two years. Encyclopædia Britannica gives 1919-1920, which is one year.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.

The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. Ill-judged financial decisions led to accumulating debts, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute. By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC Group. For how many years did Alan Sugar own the majority of the club? Answer: Alan Sugar became the majority owner of the club in December 1991 and sold it in February 2001. Therefore, he owned it for a little over 9 years (2001 - 1991 = 9, plus 2 months at the beginning, minus 1 month at the end). However, the question is asking for how many full years he owned it, which would be 9. So the answer is {9}.",10,False,history_1907_2e5f562d-7c22-4b82-9532-2cd8e7b68ca6,False,DROP,

Manfred, however, did not take the field against him until January 1266, when Charles' main army had crossed the Alps. Alarmed by desertions among his followers and fearing further treachery, Manfred sought to bring Charles to battle as swiftly as possible. Charles attempted to turn Manfred's position at Capua by a perilous crossing of the Apennines which wrecked his supply line; but Manfred had intelligence of his move and lay in a strong position across the River Calore, crossed only by one bridge. Charles had divided his cavalry into three ""battles"".

Behind them were the second battle, which consisted of 400 Italians and 1,000 men of Languedoc and central France. Charles commanded the second battle in person. Behind them, the third battle consisted of about 700 men from the county of Flanders under Constable of France Gilles II de Trasignies and Robert III of Flanders.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich. The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered. About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria. How many more deaths occurred on the Bavarian side than on the Austrian side? Answer: According to the passage, around 1,100 Bavarians died in the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre, while the Austrians lost about 40 men. In the Battle of Aidenbach, about 4,000 Bavarians died. Therefore, the total Bavarian deaths are 1,100 + 4,000 = 5,100. The total Austrian deaths are 40. The difference is 5,100 - 40 = 5,060.

Stafford’s five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson? Following their Monday Night debacle in San Diego and subsequent videotaping scandal, the Broncos returned home for an interconference match against the St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, the Broncos jumped out to a 10-0 lead, with a 4-yard touchdown run from running back Knowshon Moreno, followed by a 49-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Rams responded, with quarterback Sam Bradford throwing a 36-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui. In the second quarter, The Broncos took a 13-7 lead, with a 40-yard field goal by Prater. However, the Rams would reel off 26 unanswered points, starting off with a pair of touchdown passes from Bradford to tight end Billy Bajema&#8212;2 and 26 yards&#8212;the latter with a missed extra point, followed by a pair of field goals from placekicker Josh Brown&#8212;28 and 37 yards&#8212;before halftime. In the third quarter, the Rams continued their offensive onslaught, with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Kenneth Darby, giving St. Louis a 33-13 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos snapped the Rams' streak of 26 unanswered points, with quarterback Kyle Orton throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, but the Rams responded with a 26-yard field goal from Brown. Trailing 36-20 with four minutes remaining, the Broncos tried to rally, with Orton throwing two touchdown passes&#8212;a 16-yarder to wide receiver Eddie Royal (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 5-yarder to Lloyd, but the Broncos' rally attempt was cut short by the Rams' defense. With the loss, the Broncos matched their loss total from the previous two seasons. How many scores behind were the Rams before their first points? **Answer:** The passage states that the Broncos ""jumped out to a 10-0 lead"" before the Rams ""responded"" with their first score. This means the Rams were 10 points behind before they scored. Since touchdowns are worth 6 points and the Broncos scored one touchdown (4-yard touchdown run) and one field goal (49-yard field goal), we know field goals are worth 3 points (6 + 3 = 9 + 1 for the extra point after the TD = 10 total points). Therefore, the Rams were 10 points, or two scores (one touchdown and one field goal), behind before their first score. While the questions asks how many *scores* behind they were, and since ""score"" can be interpreted as points, the answer is {10}.",2,False,nfl_1838_38327bd5-01a4-4342-b7e0-cb209f2b4655,False,DROP,

In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side.

Santonio Holmes also missed the game after a ""small quantity of marijuana"" was found in his car and the team placed him on the inactive list. Mewelde Moore opened up the game's scoring with a 32-yard touchdown run on the Steelers opening drive. The 5-1 New York Giants responded with a field goal on the ensuing drive. Pittsburgh stopped the Giants on four consecutive plays from inside the Steelers 2-yard line to force a turnover on downs. But were unable to score when two Ben Roethlisberger interceptions and a punt lead to two more field goals in the second quarter for the Giants. At 10:10 of the third quarter Roethlisberger completed a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14-9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt.

The line, drawn about 5 km west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition. Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35 km . The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km wide front moving 20-30 km deeper into the Lithuanian territory. On July 18, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. It was approved by the Entente on July 26. The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3. Two major modifications favorable to the Poles were made: the Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km west. Again, both Poles and Lithuanians protested the line as it would require them to withdraw their armies from the Vilnius and Suwałki Regions respectively.

Answer: According to the passage, the Foch Line was approved by the Entente on July 26 and the Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3. To find the number of days, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates. July has 31 days, so from July 26 to July 31 is 5 days. August 3 is 3 days into August.

The rebellion was initially successful: the rebels defeated the royal army at Gegodog , captured most of the Javanese north coast, and took the Mataram capital Plered . King Amangkurat I died during the retreat of the royal court. His son and successor, Amangkurat II, requested help from the VOC in exchange for financial remuneration and geopolitical concessions. The VOC's subsequent involvement turned the tide of the war. VOC and Mataram forces recovered lost territories and overran Trunajaya's new capital at Kediri .

The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29th of November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands. Njdeh again proved himself as a long-sighted politician, he did not depart from Syunik and continued his struggle against the Red Army and Soviet Azerbaijan. How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started did the actual transfer of power take place in Yerevan?

On 15 June, the date of the Battle of Kosovo, he visited the site of the historical battle greeted by 100.000 people. During his visit to Kosovo vilayet he signed a general amnesty for all participants of the Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1911. He was welcomed by the choir of the Serbian Orthodox Seminary with Turkish songs and vice-consul Milan Rakić had gathered a large contingent of Serbs, but many Albanians boycotted the event. Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels in Kosovo Vilayet and Scutari Vilayet separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottoman Empire first managed to pacify the northern Albanian malësorë from Scutari Vilayet reaching a compromise during a meeting in Podgorica. In order to resolve the problems in the south, the Ottoman representatives invited Albanian southern leaders to a meeting in Tepelenë on 18 August 1911. They promised to meet most of their demands, like general amnesty, the opening of Albanian language schools, and the restriction that military service was to be performed only in the territory of the vilayets with substantial Albanian population. Other demands included requiring administrative officers to learn the Albanian language, and that the possession of weapons would be permitted. How many Albanian revolts did Mehmed V sign general amnesty for all participants during his visit to Kosovo vilayet? Answer: According to the passage, Mehmed V signed a general amnesty for all participants of the Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1911.

The Irish delegates set up headquarters at Hans Place in Knightsbridge, and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken on 5 December to recommend the treaty to Dáil Éireann.The Second Dáil Éireann narrowly ratified the Treaty. In accordance with the treaty, on 6 December 1922 the entire island of Ireland became a self-governing Dominion called the Irish Free State . Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Parliament of Northern Ireland had the option to leave the Irish Free State one month later and return to the United Kingdom. During the intervening period, the powers of the Parliament of the Irish Free State and Executive Council of the Irish Free State did not extend to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland exercised its right under the treaty to leave the new Dominion and rejoined the United Kingdom on 8 December 1922. It did so by making an address to the King requesting, ""that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland."" The Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy sharing a monarch with the United Kingdom and other Dominions of the British Commonwealth. The country had a governor-general , a bicameral parliament, a cabinet called the ""Executive Council"", and a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council. How many months after the truce of the War of Independence was called did the entire island of Ireland become the Irish Free State? Answer: According to the passage, the truce of the War of Independence was called in July 1921, and the entire island of Ireland became the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. December 1922 - July 1921 = 17 months (including the month of July 1921 and December 1922).

At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared.

The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.

Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country.

McKenzie returned the following week. How many interceptions did Arizona catch? Answer: According to the passage, there were a total of 3 interceptions by Manning, and one of them was to Terrell Thomas and another to Antrel Rolle. However, the passage does not explicitly state that both Thomas and Rolle are from Arizona, it only mentions that the game was between Giants and Cardinals, and that Terrell Thomas is a Giants player, and Antrel Rolle is a Cardinals player.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage. How many years passed of the inheritance treaty being signed and the Emperor taking back control of Schwiebus? Answer: According to the passage, the inheritance treaty was signed in 1537, and the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694. 1694 - 1537 = 157. However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of years between the signing of the treaty and the Emperor taking back control of Schwiebus, which is the difference between the year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus and the year the treaty was signed. However, the correct calculation should be the difference between the year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus and the year the Emperor gave control of Schwiebus to Elector Frederick William. 1694 - 1685 = 9.",157,False,history_1418_d76fe77e-d674-4cab-a8f1-fd18e5bf66a8,False,DROP,

French casualties exceeded 1,000 killed, 3,700 wounded, and 1,000 missing - representing losses of over 20 percent of their forces deployed in the Rif. The French accordingly intervened on the side of Spain, employing up to 160,000 well-trained and equipped troops from Metropolitan, Algerian, Senegalese and Foreign Legion units, as well as Moroccan regulars and auxiliaries. With total Spanish forces now numbering about 90,000, the Rifian forces were now seriously outnumbered by their Franco-Spanish opponents.

Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many fighters did Diaz have with 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers? Answer: The passage states that Díaz de Velasco initially had a party of 25 men. After joining with the advance party at Río Chakal, his force increased to 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers. The question asks for the number of *fighters*. While the porters and archers likely had some combat capability, the passage clearly distinguishes between the soldiers (49) and the porters and archers (34). Therefore, considering only the soldiers as confirmed fighters, Díaz had 49 fighters. If we assume all porters and archers were also fighters, then the total would be 49 + 34 = 83.

Nonetheless in 1674 the Commonwealth resumed the offensive, taking advantage of a new Muscovy-Ottoman conflict that year, and the Polish-Ottoman war remained undecided.:275 Sobieski's force of 6,000 defeated 20,000 Turks and Tatars under Ibrahim Shyshman in the battle of Lwow in August 1675.:653 Even after the Battle of Trembowla, the Sejm still refused his pleas for more funds and a larger army.:653 In 1676, after Sobieski's 16,000 withstood the two-week siege of Żurawno, by 100,000 men under Ibrahim Pasha, a new peace treaty was signed, the Treaty of Żurawno.:655 The peace treaty partially reversing those from Buczacz: the Ottomans kept approximately two thirds of the territories they gained in 1672, and the Commonwealth no longer was obliged to pay any kind of tribute to the Empire; a large number of Polish prisoners were released by the Ottomans.

Answer: According to the passage, the 1537 inheritance treaty is referenced as the basis for Brandenburg-Prussia's claims. Frederick William laid claim to the Silesian principalities in 1675. Therefore, the number of years between 1537 and 1675 is 1675 - 1537 = 38 years. So the answer is {38}.",138,False,history_1418_10cde81d-e30c-4b05-97fb-a45bbeaa2f08,False,DROP,

For example, there are more than one hundred thousand Hungarian speakers in the Hungarian American community and 1.5 million with Hungarian ancestry in the United States. How many more people speak Hungarian as a first language than a second language? Answer: The passage states that 9,827,875 people speak Hungarian as a first language and 68,458 people speak it as a second language. To find the difference, we subtract the number of second-language speakers from the number of first-language speakers: 9,827,875 - 68,458 = 9,759,417.

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na.

However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in 1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács, whereby King Louis II was killed.

Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in in 1525 compared to 1553?

In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917, the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917, the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904. The Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia gained private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants and memorialized that understanding with the Hammer and Sickle on the flag and coat of arms of the Soviet Union.Other decrees: How many days took place between the elimination of hierarchy in the army and the creation of Cheka? Answer: According to the passage, 16 December 1917 is the date when the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, and 20 December 1917 is the date when the Cheka was created. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference. The difference between 20 December 1917 and 16 December 1917 is 4 days.

ASEAN as a region accounts for 52.5 million tonnes of palm oil production, about 85 percent of the world total and more than 90 percent of global exports. Indonesia accounts for 52.2 percent of world exports. Malaysian exports total 37.9 percent. The biggest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union, and China, with the three consuming nearly 50 percent of world exports. Thailands Department of Internal Trade (DIT) usually sets the price of crude palm oil and refined palm oil. Thai farmers have a relatively low yield compared to those in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Answer: According to the passage, Ninety-five percent of Thai production is consumed locally, and 1.2 percent of global output is produced in Thailand. To find the percentage of crude palm oil produced in Thailand that is not consumed locally, we need to subtract the percentage consumed locally from the global output percentage. However, since the global output percentage is given as a percentage of global output, we need to assume that the global output is 100% to find the actual amount produced in Thailand. If we assume the global output is 100%, then 1.2% of it is produced in Thailand. Ninety-five percent of 1.2% is consumed locally, which is 0.95 * 1.2 = 1.14%.

The average household size was 2.59 and the average family size was 3.13. How many percent of households as of 2000 were not married couples living together? Answer: According to the passage, 44.0% of households were married couples living together. Since the total percentage of households cannot exceed 100%, the percentage of households that are not married couples living together can be found by subtracting 44.0% from 100%. However, we must note that the passage also mentions 11.6% had a female householder with no husband present and 39.9% were non-families. These percentages are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together. Therefore, we can find the percentage of households that are not married couples living together by subtracting 44.0% from 100% and then subtracting 11.6% and 39.9% from the result. However, since 11.6% and 39.9% are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together, we can simply subtract 44.0% from 100% and then subtract the result from 100% again. The first step is to subtract 44.0% from 100%. 100% - 44.0% = 56.0%. The second step is to subtract 56.0% from 100%. 100% - 56.0% = 44.0%. However, we must note that the passage also mentions 23.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 3.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. These percentages are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together. Therefore, we can find the percentage of households that are not married couples living together by subtracting 44.0% from 100% and then subtracting 23.2% and 3.8% from the result. However, since 23.2% and 3.8% are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together, we can simply subtract 44.0% from 100% and then subtract the result from 100% again.

His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marr's valve-in-head (Overhead valve engine) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in 1904. In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called ""Buick Motor Company,"" moved to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind. Marr was rehired in Flint as chief engineer, to begin making automobiles in production.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many members did the party lose 1933 to 1939? Answer: According to the passage, the party membership in 1933 was approximately 3.5 million members and in 1939 it was 1.9 million members. To find the number of members lost, we need to subtract the 1939 membership from the 1933 membership. However, the passage does not explicitly state the membership in 1933, but it mentions that the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936 and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. This suggests that the membership in 1933 was not the actual number of members, but rather the number before the removal of unreliable members. Therefore, the actual number of members lost is the difference between the number of members in 1939 and the number of members before the removal of unreliable members in 1933, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, we can infer that the number of members lost is at least the difference between the number of members in 1933 and the number of members in 1939.",1600000,False,history_2234_a2ea2d15-157c-495e-8078-7634045e0643,False,DROP,

If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: Since 11 miles of walking on the beach is 44 minutes of her walk, the rate at which Kimia walks on the beach is 11 miles / 44 minutes = 11/44 miles per minute. Since Kimia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach, the rate at which Kimia walks on the sidewalk is 2 * 11/44 = 22/44 miles per minute.

If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms? Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the maintenance worker spends cleaning rooms per day. Since it takes them 15 minutes per room and they have to clean 160 rooms, they will spend 160 * 15 = 2400 minutes cleaning rooms per day. Since they work 10 hours each day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work a total of 10 * 60 = 600 minutes per day. Therefore, they spend 2400 / 600 = 4 minutes out of every 10 minutes working on cleaning rooms. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we can divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (2400 / 600) * 100 = 400%. However, this is not the correct answer. The question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, not the percentage of the total minutes spent cleaning rooms. To find the correct answer, we need to divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (2400 / 600) * 100 = 400%. Then we need to convert the fraction of the day into a percentage. 400% is equivalent to 4/10, which is equivalent to 2/5. 2/5 is equivalent to 40%.

Answer: To find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we need to find the combined length of the remoras and divide it by the dolphin's body length. The remoras are 6 inches long each, so the combined length of the remoras is 6 * 6 = 36 inches. We need to convert the dolphin's body length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the dolphin's body length is 60 feet * 12 inches per foot = 720 inches. The combined length of the remoras is 36 inches, and the dolphin's body length is 720 inches. To find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the dolphin's body length and multiply by 100: (36 inches / 720 inches) * 100 = 5% The answer is {5}.",5.0,True,46,False,symbolic,5.0

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early? Answer: To find the number of students who are leaving early, we need to find the total number of students who are either swimmers, debate team members, or part of the choir. First, we need to find the number of students who are not swimmers. Since 40% of the class are swimmers, the number of students who are not swimmers is 100% - 40% = 60% of the class. The number of students who are not swimmers is 60% * 125 students = 0.6 * 125 = 75 students. Out of the remaining 75 students, 32% are debate team members or part of the choir. The number of students who are debate team members or part of the choir is 32% * 75 = 0.32 * 75 = 24 students. Since 40% of the class are swimmers, the number of students who are swimmers is 40% * 125 students = 0.4 * 125 = 50 students.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many plums Yuki has in total. Since Yuki has 35 square meters of plum field and there are 78 plums per square meter, we can calculate the total number of plums as 35 * 78 = 2730 plums. Since Yuki can harvest his plums every 2 months, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12/2 = 6 periods of 2 months in a year. Therefore, Yuki can harvest 2730 plums / 6 periods = 455 plums per period. Since there are 6 periods in a year, Yuki can harvest a total of 455 * 6 = 2730 plums within a year. However, this is the number of plums Yuki can harvest per period, not the total number of plums he can harvest in a year. Since Yuki can harvest all the plums in his field every 2 months, the total number of plums he can harvest in a year is still 2730 plums.

If she used a total of 1455 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. Answer: Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let s be the number of teaspoons of sugar and w be the number of cups of water. We know that 197 : 94 = s : w, so we can write 197w = 94s. We are also given that 1455 = s + w. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of s. Rearranging the second equation, we get w = 1455 - s. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 197(1455 - s) = 94s. Expanding and simplifying, we get 288,095 - 197s = 94s. Adding 197s to both sides, we get 288,095 = 291s. Dividing both sides by 291, we get s = 992.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and each serving has 450 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 450 = 2250 calories. Since you have already consumed 1525 calories, you still have a daily calorie target of 1975 - 1525 = 450 calories left. Now, we need to find out how many servings of cookies you can eat with the remaining calories. Since each serving has 450 calories, you can eat 450/450 = 1 serving.

How many apricots can Luis harvest within a year? Answer: Since Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest them twice within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months. First, we need to find out how many apricots Luis has in total. Since he has 15 square yards of apricot field and there are 43 apricots per square yard, he has 15 * 43 = 645 apricots in total. Now, we need to find out how many apricots Luis can harvest in 6 months. Since he has 645 apricots in total and he can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 645/2 = 322.5 apricots in 6 months. However, since he cannot harvest a fraction of an apricot, we can assume that he can harvest 322 apricots in 6 months. Now, we can find out how many apricots Luis can harvest within a year.

How many like to play music if the number that like to dance is twice the number that prefer playing hurling? Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play hurling is 7 + 34 = 41 students. Since the rest of the students like to either play music or dance, the number of students who like to play music or dance is 189 - 41 = 148 students. Let's assume the number of students who like to play hurling is x. Then, the number of students who like to dance is twice the number that prefer playing hurling, which is 2x. We know that the total number of students who like to dance or play music is 148. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 148. Combine like terms: 3x = 148.

7,8b,"Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, wheats, cucumbers, and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys four 4-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 7-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 41-pound packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 17-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 200 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed? Answer: The total weight of the hay is four 4-pound boxes * 4 pounds = 16 pounds. The total weight of the cucumbers is twelve 7-pound bags * 7 pounds = 84 pounds. The total weight of the oats is thirty four 41-pound packs * 41 pounds = 1394 pounds. The total weight of the Wheats is eighteen 17-pound sacks * 17 pounds = 306 pounds. The total weight of all the feed is 16 + 84 + 1394 + 306 = 1500 pounds. The farmer needs to make 1500 pounds / 200 pounds = 7.5 trips.

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cookies than on Monday and 28 boxes of banana pie. If the cookie cost €9 and the banana pie cost €32, how much did Yusuf earn for two days? Answer: On Monday, Yusuf sold 29 boxes of cookie and 11 fewer boxes of banana pie, than on Tuesday. So, he sold 29 - 11 = 18 boxes of banana pie on Monday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cookies than on Monday, so he sold 29 + 11 = 40 boxes of cookie on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of banana pie.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 18 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 18 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 18 seconds, but in the final 18 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 18 seconds. After Noah takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat? Answer: In the first 18 seconds, 80 kernels popped. In the next 18 seconds, 2 times that amount popped, so 2 * 80 = 160 kernels popped. In the next 18 seconds, the kernels popped at 4 times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 80 = 320 kernels popped. In the final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 18 seconds, so half of 320 popped, which is 320/2 = 160 kernels popped.

If he also paid $330000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Mr. Brown's net proceeds from selling the villa? Answer: The transfer fees are 1% of $480000, so they amount to 1% * $480000 = $4800. The brokerage fee is 2% of $480000, so it amounts to 2% * $480000 = $9600. Therefore, the total amount Mr. Brown paid in fees is $4800 + $9600 = $14400. Mr. Brown's net proceeds from selling the villa is the selling price minus the fees and the remaining loan amount, so it is $480000 - $330000 - $14400 = $480000 - $330000 - $14400 = $132600.

On Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday and 28 boxes of grape pie. If the cupcake cost ₣9 and the grape pie cost ₣23, how much did Ibrahim earn for two days? Answer: On Thursday, he sold 26 boxes of cupcake and 19 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Friday. So on Thursday, he sold 26 - 19 = 7 boxes of grape pie. On Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday and 28 boxes of grape pie. So on Friday, he sold 26 + 13 = 39 boxes of cupcake.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the hospital after 3 weeks. Answer: First, we need to find out how many wards are occupied at the beginning. Since 2/5 of the wards are occupied, the number of occupied wards is 1900 * 2/5 = 760 wards. The total number of unoccupied wards at the beginning is 1900 - 760 = 1140 wards. Since 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is 50 * 21 = 1050 patients. However, we are only interested in the number of wards, not the number of patients. Since each ward can accommodate 2 patients (as the number of occupied wards is 2/5 of the total wards), the total number of wards occupied by these patients is 1050 / 2 = 525 wards.

2,70b,"Reformatted Question: Yusuf is rolling a d10 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row? Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%. The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row. The answer is {100}.",25.0,False,129,False,symbolic,100.0

If he also paid $480000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Mr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the cottage? Answer: Mr. Jones paid 3% of $610000 = 0.03 * 610000 = $18300 for the transfer fees. He also paid 5% of $610000 = 0.05 * 610000 = $30500 for the brokerage fee. So, the total fees paid by Mr. Jones is $18300 + $30500 = $48800. He also paid $480000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage. Thus, Mr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the cottage is $610000 - $48800 - $480000 = $610000 - $529800 = $80200. The answer is {80200}.",81200.0,False,1719,False,symbolic,80200.0
2,70b,"Reformatted Question: Jin is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row? Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d20 die is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4, since there are 10 even numbers on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total, and the rolls are independent. To find the difference in probability, we need to convert both probabilities to a common format. We can convert 14/20 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 14/20 = 0.7. We can convert 1/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/4 = 0.25. The difference in probability is 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.45 * 100 = 45%. Therefore, it is 45% more likely that Jin rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 135 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Ava is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Quinn decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? Answer: Ava currently has 30 signatures, and Quinn has 37 signatures. Together, they have 30 + 37 = 67 signatures. Their goal is to reach 135 signatures by the end of spring break. This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 67 = 68 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks. Ava's collection will be reduced by 5 signatures per week, so over the 2 weeks she will collect 5 * 2 = 10 fewer signatures than she did during the first 3 weeks. We don't know her exact rate during the first 3 weeks, but it's not necessary. We only need to know her reduction from the previous rate. Therefore, Quinn needs to collect the remaining signatures herself, taking into account Ava's reduced rate: 68 signatures (total needed) - 10 signatures (Ava's reduction) = 58 signatures. Since there are 2 weeks left, Quinn needs to collect 58 / 2 = 29 signatures per week to reach their goal. The answer is {29}.",29.0,True,200,False,symbolic,29.0

She wants to make a vest, cardigan, shawl, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a vest, 4 for a cardigan, 10 for a shawl, 12 for a pair of gloves, and 9 for a pair of mittens. Sakura wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 4 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $9. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Sakura pay for all the skeins of wool she needs? Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins of wool needed for each grandchild. For each grandchild, Sakura needs: * Vest: 5 skeins * Cardigan: 4 skeins * Shawl: 10 skeins * Gloves: 12 skeins * Mittens: 9 skeins Total per grandchild: 5 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 40 skeins Since she has 4 grandchildren, she needs 40 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 160 skeins for her grandchildren. Next, let's calculate the wool needed for her jackets. She needs 4 skeins/jacket * 2 jackets = 8 skeins for herself. Therefore, the total number of skeins Sakura needs is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins. Now, let's calculate the cost. Since each dozen (12) skeins costs $9, the cost of 168 skeins is (168/12) * $9 = 14 * $9 = $126. Finally, let's apply the discount. Since the total cost ($126) is over $100, Sakura receives a $20 discount. So, the final amount Sakura should pay is $126 - $20 = $106. The answer is {106}.",106.0,True,138,False,symbolic,106.0

The cafe has a promotion that if one buys 6 muffins or more, they get a 10% discount on muffins. How much more do 2 loaves of sourdough cost than 8 muffins? Answer: The cost of one muffin is one-eighth the cost of a loaf of sourdough, which is $10 / 8 = $1.25. Since we are buying 8 muffins, and this is more than 6 muffins, we apply the 10% discount. The discount per muffin is $1.25 * 0.10 = $0.125. Therefore, the discounted price per muffin is $1.25 - $0.125 = $1.125. The cost of 8 muffins is 8 * $1.125 = $9. The cost of 2 loaves of sourdough is 2 * $10 = $20. The difference in cost is $20 - $9 = $11. Therefore, 2 loaves of sourdough cost $11 more than 8 muffins.

After a 5% discount, she paid a total of $1330. What was the cost of brownies per dozen? Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Nia bought 60 croissants, which is 60/12 = 5 dozen croissants. The cost of the croissants is 5 dozen * $19/dozen = $95. Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Nia bought 72 macarons, which is 72/12 = 6 dozen macarons. The cost of the macarons is 6 dozen * $20/dozen = $120. Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $95 + $120 = $215. Let's denote the cost of the 36 brownies as 'x'. So, before the discount, the total cost of all items was $215 + x. Nia received a 5% discount, meaning she paid 95% of the original price. Therefore, 0.95 * ($215 + x) = $1330. To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 0.95: $215 + x = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400 Subtracting $215 from both sides, we find the total cost of the brownies: x = $1400 - $215 = $1185. Finally, since Nia bought 36 brownies, this is 36/12 = 3 dozen brownies. Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen is $1185 / 3 = $395. The answer is {395}.",395.0,True,217,False,symbolic,395.0

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row, than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row? Answer: A d4 die has four sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. For rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row: There are three numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4). The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. To roll it twice in a row, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%. For rolling four odd numbers in a row: There are two odd numbers on a d4 die (1 and 3). The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%. The difference in likelihood is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points. Therefore, it is 50 percentage points more likely that Gabriel rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to play music is 7 less than two times the number that prefer playing volleyball? Answer: First, let's find the total number of students who enjoy dance, chess, swimming, and volleyball. This is 5 + 8 + 13 + 32 = 58 students. Next, we determine the number of students who like to play music. The question states that this number is 7 less than two times the number of students who prefer playing volleyball. Since 32 students like to play volleyball, the number of students who like music is (2 * 32) - 7 = 57 students. Now we can find the number of students who like to play video games. The total number of students is 230. Subtracting the students with other hobbies, we get 230 - 58 - 57 = 115 students who like video games. Finally, to find the percentage of students who like video games, we divide the number of students who like video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (115 / 230) * 100 = 50%.

How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three? Answer: First, let's find Ravi's current age using Ravi will be 47 in 8 years. His current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old. Next, let's find Pavel's current age using Ravi and Pavel are currently 22 years apart in age and the fact that Ravi is younger than Pavel. Pavel's current age is 39 + 22 = 61 years old. Now, let's find Leilani's current age using Ravi and Leilani are currently 10 years apart in age and the fact that Ravi is older than Leilani. Leilani's current age is 39 - 10 = 29 years old. To find the average age of all three, we add their ages together and divide by 3: (39 + 61 + 29) / 3 = 129 / 3 = 43 years old. Finally, to determine how much younger Leilani is than the average age, we subtract Leilani's age from the average age: 43 - 29 = 14 years.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 25% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months? Answer: First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The uncle and spouse together eat 16 + 16 = 32 pizzas per day. The grandchild eats half of this, which is 32 / 2 = 16 pizzas per day. Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 32 + 16 = 48 pizzas per day. Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 48 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 1440 pizzas in the first month. In the second month, they reduce their consumption. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 25%. This means they eat 48 pizzas/day * 0.75 = 36 pizzas/day. Over 15 days, they consume 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas. For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional 50% from the already reduced amount. So they eat 36 pizzas/day * 0.5 = 18 pizzas/day. Over 15 days, they consume 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas. Therefore, in the second month, they eat a total of 540 + 270 = 810 pizzas. Over the two months, the family eats 1440 + 810 = 2250 pizzas. The answer is {2250}.",2250.0,True,156,False,symbolic,2250.0

How many emails does Sanjay respond to in a 4 day work week? Sanjay works overtime on the last day so he can respond to 20% more emails than usual. Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day. 25% of 32 emails don't need a response, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails. This means 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day. Next, let's determine how many emails Sanjay responds to daily. He responds to 2 less than half of the 24 emails that require a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails. Now, let's calculate the number of emails Sanjay responds to during the first three days of the work week. For three days, he responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails. On the last day, Sanjay responds to 20% more emails than usual. This is an increase of 0.20 * 10 = 2 emails. So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails. Finally, let's find the total number of emails responded to during the 4 day work week.

Hiroshi collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, and he gets paid ₣0.25 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week? Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first five complexes. According to , each of the first five complexes has 100 apartments, so there are 5 * 100 = 500 apartments in total. Next, let's find the number of apartments in the sixth complex. The question states in that the sixth complex is 40% bigger than the other five combined (500 apartments). Therefore, the sixth complex has 500 + (0.40 * 500) = 700 apartments. Now let's account for the vacant apartments. states that 8 apartments in each of the first 5 complexes were vacant. This means a total of 5 * 8 = 40 apartments did not require service. This leaves a total of 500 + 700 - 40 = 1160 apartments requiring garbage collection. tells us Hiroshi collects garbage twice a week from each apartment. So he makes 1160 apartments * 2 collections/apartment = 2320 collections. His base pay is 2320 collections * ₣0.25/collection = ₣580. Finally, he receives an additional 10% in tips, so his tip earnings are 0.10 * 580 = ₣58. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are ₣580 + ₣58 = ₣638.

On Thursday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 3-hour episodes. On Friday, he watched three episodes, each 30 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday? Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Sunday through Friday, excluding Tuesday. * **Sunday and Monday:** He watched 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV. * **Wednesday:** He watched a 2-hour episode + a 1-hour episode = 3 hours of TV. * **Thursday:** He watched 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours of TV. * **Friday:** He watched 3 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 1.5 hours of TV. Total TV time excluding Tuesday: 8 + 3 + 9 + 1.5 = 21.5 hours. Since he watched a total of 24 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Tuesday was 24 hours - 21.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years? Answer: First, we calculate the registration fees: 3% of $760,000 is 0.03 * $760,000 = $22,800. Next, we calculate the agent fee: 4% of $760,000 is 0.04 * $760,000 = $30,400. The total fees and costs paid by Prof. Miller are the registration fees ($22,800) + the agent fee ($30,400) + the remaining loan amount ($570,000) + closing costs ($15,000) = $638,200. Prof. Miller's net proceeds from the sale are the selling price ($760,000) minus the total fees and costs ($638,200) which equals $121,800. This amount ($121,800) was invested in stocks.

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Leon still missing? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop per day: ¥150 (hotel) + ¥30 (food) + ¥10 (transportation) = ¥190 per day. For a 2-day workshop, the total cost is ¥190 * 2 = ¥380.

Zahra weighs 150 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 calories in food and 225 calories in ice cream. How many more ounces of breads does Carlos need to consume than Zahra? Answer: First, let's calculate Carlos's calorie needs. His healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound * 200 lbs = 3000 calories. He has consumed 900 calories and burned 150 calories, meaning his net calorie consumption is 900 - 150 = 750 calories. Therefore, he needs 3000 - 750 = 2250 more calories. Next, let's calculate Zahra's calorie needs. Her healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound * 150 lbs = 2250 calories. She has consumed 900 calories + 225 calories = 1125 calories. Therefore, she needs 2250 - 1125 = 1125 more calories. Now, let's figure out how many calories are in one ounce of bread. A 300-ounce bag has 5 servings, so each serving is 300/5 = 60 ounces. Since each serving has 225 calories, one ounce of bread contains 225/60 = 3.75 calories. Carlos needs 2250 more calories, so he needs 2250 / 3.75 = 600 ounces of bread. Zahra needs 1125 more calories, so she needs 1125 / 3.75 = 300 ounces of bread. Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Carlos and Zahra need is 600 - 300 = 300 ounces.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Sakura remain with? Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Sakura had before receiving any new plants. She had 7 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 420 plants. Next, let's account for the new plants. Two days ago, she received 49 new plants, and yesterday, she bought 100 new plants. This means she received a total of 49 + 100 = 149 new plants. Note that the 50% discount is irrelevant to the total number of plants she now has. So, before giving plants away, Sakura had 420 + 149 = 569 potted plants. Finally, she will give away 3 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 180 plants. Therefore, Sakura will remain with 569 - 180 = 389 potted plants. The answer is {389}.",389.0,True,78,False,symbolic,389.0

However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 10 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms? Answer: The janitor initially takes 6 minutes to clean a room, but due to the injury (twice as long), it now takes them 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes per room. To clean all 80 rooms, it will take them 12 minutes/room * 80 rooms = 960 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 960 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 16 hours of work. Over 4 days, this means they need to work an average of 16 hours / 4 days = 4 hours per day. They work for 10 hours a day, and spend 4 hours cleaning. Therefore, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is (4 hours / 10 hours) * 100% = 40%. The answer is {40}.",40.0,True,234,False,symbolic,40.0

On the sidewalk, Fatima walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Fatima's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: Let's denote Fatima's original speed on the beach as 's'. Due to her injury, her current speed on the beach is s/2. Since she walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, her current speed on the beach is: Speed_beach = Distance_beach / Time_beach = 11 miles / 44 minutes = 0.25 miles/minute Her original speed on the beach was therefore 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute. According to the problem, her original speed on the sidewalk was three times her beach speed, which is 3 * 0.5 miles/minute = 1.5 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles/minute / 2 = 0.75 miles/minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is: Time_sidewalk = Distance_sidewalk / Speed_sidewalk = 15 miles / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes Therefore, the total time to complete her walk is the sum of her time on the beach and her time on the sidewalk: Total_time = Time_beach + Time_sidewalk = 44 minutes + 20 minutes = 64 minutes The answer is {64}.",64.0,True,104,False,symbolic,64.0

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 120 clams if it takes 14 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Aisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a 7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them. Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel 120 clams. Since she peels 10 clams per minute, it will take her 120 clams / 10 clams/minute = 12 minutes to peel all the clams. Next, we need to account for the clam washing time. Washing each clam takes 14 seconds, and there are 120 clams, so the total washing time is 120 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1680 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes. The total time for peeling is the peeling time plus washing time: 12 minutes + 28 minutes = 40 minutes. After peeling, Aisha takes a 7-minute break before sautéing. Now let's figure out the sautéing time. Aisha sautés 30 clams in 6 minutes, meaning her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 6 minutes = 5 clams per minute. To sauté 120 clams will take 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes. Finally, we add up all the times: 40 minutes (peeling and washing) + 7 minutes (break) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 71 minutes. Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and sauté 120 clams.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 4 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 6 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Andre takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Andre gives 1/10 of the made popcorn to his brother Jin. How many more pieces of popcorn does Andre have to eat than his brother? Answer: First, let's calculate the popcorn popping in each 10-second interval: * **Interval 1:** 80 kernels popped. * **Interval 2:** 4 * 80 = 320 kernels popped. * **Interval 3:** 6 * 80 = 480 kernels popped. * **Interval 4:** 480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped. After the pot is removed, 240 / 4 = 60 kernels pop from residual heat. The total number of popped kernels is 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180. Andre gives 1/10 of 1180 to Jin, which is 1180 / 10 = 118 kernels. Andre keeps 1180 - 118 = 1062 kernels. The difference between the amount Andre eats and the amount Jin eats is 1062 - 118 = 944.

Diego's brother, Qasim, is 9 years younger than Diego, and Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim. What will be the average of all four in 4 years? Answer: First, let's determine Priya's current age. In 5 years, Priya will be twice Diego's current age (2 times as old as Diego is now), which is 2 * 21 = 42 years old. Therefore, Priya's current age is 42 - 5 = 37 years old. Next, let's find Qasim's current age. Qasim is 9 years younger than Diego (Diego's brother, Qasim, is 9 years younger than Diego), so Qasim is 21 - 9 = 12 years old. Now, let's find Mia's current age. Mia is 10 years older than Qasim (Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim), making Mia 12 + 10 = 22 years old. In 4 years, their ages will be: * Diego: 21 + 4 = 25 years old * Priya: 37 + 4 = 41 years old * Qasim: 12 + 4 = 16 years old * Mia: 22 + 4 = 26 years old To find the average age in 4 years, we add their ages and divide by 4: (25 + 41 + 16 + 26) / 4 = 108 / 4 = 27 years old.

Answer: The question asks what percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits. We are told in that half of the 40 white animals were rabbits. Therefore, the number of rabbits is 40 / 2 = 20 rabbits. The information about the number of ants (two-fourths as many ants as wasps), grasshoppers (36 grasshoppers), and wasps (16 wasps) is irrelevant to determining the percentage of rabbits. The total number of white animals is given in as 40. Since 20 out of 40 white animals are rabbits, the percentage of white animals that are rabbits is (20/40) * 100% = 50%.

During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 5 weeks, Chen and Tara compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Chen has 36 signatures in her book, and Tara has 32 signatures. The sisters have 4 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 140 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? Answer: Currently, Chen and Tara have a combined total of 36 + 32 = 68 signatures. Their goal is to reach 140 signatures by the end of the 4 weeks of winter break. This means they need to collect an additional 140 - 68 = 72 signatures. During the remaining 4 weeks, Chen's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures. Therefore, over the next 4 weeks, Chen will collect 4 weeks * (her current weekly rate - 5) signatures = an unknown number of signatures. We don't know Chen's current weekly rate, but we can work out how many signatures Chen will add to her total: Let's say Chen's current weekly average is 'x' signatures. Then her new weekly rate is (x-5) signatures. After 4 weeks she will have collected 4(x-5) signatures in total. Tara needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal. Let's say Tara collects 'y' signatures per week. Over the next 4 weeks, Tara will collect 4y signatures. The total number of signatures collected by Chen and Tara in the remaining 4 weeks must equal 72. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 4(x-5) + 4y = 72 We don't know 'x', but we know that over 5 weeks Chen collected 36 signatures. Therefore we can estimate x to be approximately 36/5 = 7.2. Thus 4(7.2-5) = 8.8 Solving for 'y' (Tara's weekly collection): 4(7.2 - 5) + 4y = 72 8.8 + 4y = 72 4y = 72 - 8.8 4y = 63.2 y = 15.8 Since Tara cannot collect parts of signatures, she needs to collect at least 16 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 11 keychains that were $21.0 each. Chen then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Chen have left? Answer: Let's break down Chen's spending: First, the taffy: She bought 23 kgs of taffy. The deal was 16 kgs at $22/kg, so that's 16 kgs * $22/kg = $352. The additional 23-16=7 kgs received a 1/4 discount, meaning each kg cost $22 - ($22 * 0.25) = $16.50. The cost of those 7 kgs is 7 kgs * $16.50/kg = $115.50. Her total taffy cost is $352 + $115.50 = $467.50. Next, the starfish and keychains: The starfish cost $11.0, and the keychains cost 11 * $21.0 = $231. Finally, the donation: Chen donated $5. Therefore, her total spending is $467.50 + $11 + $231 + $5 = $714.50. Starting with $1300, she has $1300 - $714.50 = $585.50 left. The answer is {585.50}.",580.0,False,242,False,symbolic,585.5

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for $11.0 and 18 pins that were $20.5 each. Ava then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ava have left? Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the cotton candy. Ava bought 23 pounds. The sale was for 17 pounds at $22 per pound, which costs 17 * $22 = $374. The discount on the extra 4 pounds is (4 * $22) / 2 = $44. So the total cost of the cotton candy is $374 + (4*$22 - $44) = $374 + $44 = $418. Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins: Ava bought 18 pins at $20.5 each, costing 18 * $20.5 = $369. Now let's add up all Ava's expenses: The cotton candy cost $418, the coral cost $11.0, the pins cost $369, and the charity donation was $5. Therefore, her total spending is $418 + $11 + $369 + $5 = $803.

How many emails does Carlos respond to in a 4 day work week? Carlos work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 75% more emails than usual. Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day. Since 25% of the 32 emails don't require a response, that means 32 * 0.25 = 8 emails don't need a response. Therefore, Carlos receives 32 - 8 = 24 emails that require a response each day. Next, let's determine how many of those emails Carlos can actually respond to. He responds to 4 less than half, so he responds to (24 / 2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 emails daily. Now, let's calculate the number of emails Carlos responds to during a regular 4-day work week. That's 8 emails/day * 4 days = 32 emails. Finally, let's account for the overtime on the last day. On that day, due to responding to 75% more emails than usual, Carlos responds to 8 emails * 1.75 = 14 emails. Therefore, the total number of emails responded to during the work week is 32 (regular days) + 14 (overtime) = 46 emails. Therefore, Carlos responds to 46 emails in his 4-day work week.

Unfortunately, 2 plates break. Benjamin then eats one-eighth of all the crackers. How many more bowls does Benjamin need so he can place all the remaining crackers? Answer: First, let's determine the capacity of each plate. Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers as a bowl (21 crackers per bowl), each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers. Next, calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates before the breakage. Benjamin has 9 bowls, each holding 21 crackers, for a total of 9 * 21 = 189 crackers. He initially has 3 plates, each holding 42 crackers, for a total of 3 * 42 = 126 crackers. Combined, the bowls and plates could hold 189 + 126 = 315 crackers. After 2 plates break, the total capacity is reduced by 2 * 42 = 84 crackers. The new capacity is 315 - 84 = 231 crackers. Benjamin starts with 720 crackers and eats one-eighth of them, which is 720 / 8 = 90 crackers. This leaves him with 720 - 90 = 630 crackers. To determine how many more bowls are needed, we find out how many bowls would be required to hold all 630 remaining crackers. Each bowl holds 21 crackers, so the number of bowls needed is 630 / 21 = 30 bowls. Finally, subtract the number of bowls Benjamin already has (9 bowls) from the number of bowls needed (30 bowls): 30 - 9 = 21. Therefore, Benjamin needs 21 more bowls.

If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk, in minutes? Answer: We know Emma walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 56 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach *before* her injury was (14 kilometers / 56 minutes) = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or 0.25/2 = 0.125 kilometers per minute. Emma walks 18 kilometers on the sidewalk. Before her injury, she walked three times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach (three times the rate of speed), meaning her sidewalk speed was 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 kilometers per minute.

Before the discount, the total cost was the cost of the croissants plus the cost of the macarons plus the cost of the brownies (which we'll call 'x'). So, the pre-discount total was $24 + $80 + x. Aisha received a 20% discount and paid a total of $1520. This means that 80% of the original price was $1520. We can set up an equation: 0.80 * ($24 + $80 + x) = $1520. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.80 * (104 + x) = 1520. Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get: 104 + x = 1900. Subtracting 104 from both sides, we find x = $1800. Therefore, the total cost of the brownies was $1800. Finally, since Aisha bought 24 brownies, which is 2 dozen (24 brownies / 12 brownies/dozen = 2 dozen), the cost per dozen brownies was $1800 / 2 dozen = $900 per dozen. The answer is {900}.",898.0,False,220,False,symbolic,900.0

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Theo weighs 250 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 150 calories through exercise. Sakura weighs 130 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 calories in food and 175 calories in ice cream. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura? Answer: First, let's calculate Theo's and Sakura's calorie needs. Theo's target calorie intake is 15 calories/lb * 250 lbs = 3750 calories. He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 150 calories, so his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 150 = 950 calories. Therefore, Theo needs 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories. Sakura's target calorie intake is 15 calories/lb * 130 lbs = 1950 calories. She has consumed 900 calories + 175 calories = 1075 calories. Thus, Sakura needs 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories. Next, let's determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies. Each serving contains 175 calories, and a 125 oz bag has 5 servings. Therefore, one ounce of cookies contains 175 calories / 5 servings / (125 oz / 5 servings) = 2.8 calories/oz. Now we can find out how many ounces of cookies each person needs. Theo needs 2800 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 1000 oz of cookies. Sakura needs 875 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 312.5 oz of cookies. Finally, let's find the difference in the amount of cookies needed. Theo needs 1000 oz - 312.5 oz = 687.5 more ounces of cookies than Sakura. The answer is {687.5}.",275.0,False,147,False,symbolic,687.5

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: We know Olivia walks 13 miles on the beach and it takes her 65 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach before her injury was 13 miles / 65 minutes = 0.2 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, 0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute (speed decreased by half on the beach). Since she walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk as on the beach (four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk), her sidewalk speed before the injury was 4 * 0.2 miles/minute = 0.8 miles/minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is half that: 0.8 miles/minute / 2 = 0.4 miles/minute (speed decreased by half on the sidewalk). Now we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Olivia walks 16 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.4 miles/minute. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 40 minutes. Finally, to find the total time for the walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 65 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 105 minutes.

Valeria then found 18 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 30 caterpillars, and 15 beetles. What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits? Answer: The question asks for the percentage of animals that were rabbits. We are given that Valeria found 18 white animals, and half of which were rabbits. This means there were 18/2 = 9 rabbits. The total number of animals mentioned is the sum of the rabbits, caterpillars, and beetles. We have 9 rabbits + 30 caterpillars + 15 beetles = 54 animals. The percentage of animals that were rabbits is (9 rabbits / 54 total animals) * 100% = 16.67%. Rounding to the nearest whole number, approximately 17% of the animals in the patch were rabbits.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 2 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row? Answer: A four-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's analyze the probabilities: * **Fact 2: Rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:** The numbers greater than 2 on the four-sided die are 3 and 4. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25% or 0.25. * **Fact 3: Rolling four even numbers in a row:** The only even number on the four-sided die is 2. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number (a 2) on a single roll is 1/4 = 25%. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256 ≈ 0.39% or 0.0039. To find the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row: 25% - 0.39% = 24.61% Therefore, Tariq is 24.61 percentage points more likely to roll a number greater than 2 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.

During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Uma and Zahra compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Uma has 29 signatures in her book, and Zahra has 37 signatures. The sisters have 4 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 130 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Zahra decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? Answer: Currently, Uma and Zahra have a combined total of 29 + 37 = 66 signatures. Their goal is to reach 130 signatures by the end of spring break. This means they need to collect an additional 130 - 66 = 64 signatures in the remaining 4 weeks. Uma's collection rate will be reduced by 5 signatures per week due to collecting only on weekends. Over 4 weeks, this means she will collect 4 * (her current average - 5) signatures. We don't know Uma's current average weekly collection rate, but it can be calculated by dividing the number of signatures she has by the number of weeks: 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. So she will collect approximately 4 * (4.83 - 5) = -0.68 signatures (we can round this to 0 because you can't collect a negative number of signatures). Therefore, Zahra needs to collect the remaining 64 signatures herself, during the remaining 4 weeks. To achieve this, she will need to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

Later, Luis saw another 10-foot dolphin with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras? Answer: First, let's calculate the total length of remoras on the first dolphin. Initially, there were 24 remoras, each 18 inches long, totaling 24 * 18 = 432 inches. After a third swam away, 24/3 = 8 remoras left, representing a total length of 8 * 18 = 144 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the 144 inches is equivalent to 144/12 = 12 feet. The percentage of the 48-foot dolphin's body length covered by remoras is (12 feet / 48 feet) * 100% = 25%. Next, let's consider the second dolphin. It had 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, totaling 6 * 8 = 48 inches. This is equivalent to 48/12 = 4 feet. The percentage of the 10-foot dolphin's body length covered by remoras is (4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%. To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 40%) / 2 = 32.5%. Therefore, on average, 32.5% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.

How much more money does Valentina have left than Liam after they leave the store? Answer: Let's calculate Valentina's expenses first. * **Screws:** 17 screws * ¥0.3/screw = ¥5.10 * **Washers:** 9 washers * ¥0.59/washer = ¥5.31 * **Paint:** The cost of Valentina's paint is 8 gallons * the price per gallon (which is not given but is irrelevant since we only need the final amount). Valentina's total spending is ¥5.10 + ¥5.31 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint) = ¥10.41 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint). We don't need to know the exact price per gallon of paint since it will subtract equally from both total amounts. Now let's calculate Liam's expenses. * **Paint:** 10 gallons * ¥8.0/gallon = ¥80.00. With a 10% discount, Liam pays ¥80.00 * 0.90 = ¥72.00 * **Pencils:** 3 pencils * ¥2/pencil = ¥6.00 Liam's total spending is ¥72.00 + ¥6.00 = ¥78.00 To find the difference in remaining money, we calculate: Valentina's remaining money: ¥99.41 - ¥10.41 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint) = ¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint) Liam's remaining money: ¥90 - ¥78.00 = ¥12.00 The difference is (¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)) - ¥12.00 = ¥77 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint). As long as the price per gallon for paint is the same for both, the cost of paint cancels out, and Valentina has ¥77 more left than Liam. Therefore, Valentina has ¥77 more money left than Liam after they leave the store. Note that we don't need the price per gallon of paint to solve this problem.

If 51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 33-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as 's'. Before her injury, her sidewalk speed was twice her beach speed, or 2s. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now s/2, and her speed on the sidewalk is now 2s/2 = s. We know she spends 51 minutes on the beach and covers 17 miles. Therefore, her current beach speed is 17 miles / 51 minutes = 1/3 mile per minute. Since her sidewalk speed is the same as her original speed on the beach, her current sidewalk speed is also 1/3 mile per minute. The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance on the sidewalk (16 miles) divided by her sidewalk speed (1/3 mile/minute), which is 16 miles / (1/3 mile/minute) = 48 minutes.

If 42 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk, in minutes? Answer: We know Rania walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 42 minutes. This means her speed on the beach, before her injury, would have been 14 km / 42 min = 1/3 km/min.

How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten? **Answer:** Amelia eats twice as much as Aisha, so Amelia eats 3 * 2 = 6 servings a day. Ava eats four times as much as Amelia, so Ava eats 6 * 4 = 24 servings a day. In the first 2 days, Aisha eats 3 servings/day * 2 days = 6 servings. Amelia eats 6 servings/day * 2 days = 12 servings. Ava eats 24 servings/day * 2 days = 48 servings. Total servings consumed in the first 2 days: 6 + 12 + 48 = 66 servings. Remaining servings: 87 - 66 = 21 servings. After 2 days, Ava eats half as much, so she eats 24 / 2 = 12 servings a day. Combined consumption per day after 2 days: 3 (Aisha) + 6 (Amelia) + 12 (Ava) = 21 servings/day. Days to finish remaining servings: 21 servings / 21 servings/day = 1 day. Total days to eat the pizza: 2 days + 1 day = 3 days. The answer is {3}.",3.0,True,222,False,symbolic,3.0

How many emails does Sanjay respond to in a 4 day work week? Sanjay work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 20% more emails than usual. **Answer:** First, let's figure out how many emails Sanjay receives that *do* require a response each day. Since 25% don't require a response, that means 100% - 25% = 75% *do* require a response. So, he needs to respond to 0.75 * 32 emails = 24 emails. Next, we find out how many of those emails he *can* respond to. He responds to 2 less than half of the 24 emails requiring responses, which is (24 / 2) - 2 = 10 emails per day. For the first three days of his four-day work week, Sanjay responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails. On the last day (due to overtime), Sanjay responds to 20% more than usual. This means he responds to an additional 0.20 * 10 emails = 2 emails. So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails. In total, for the entire week, Sanjay responds to 30 + 12 = 42 emails.

The cafe has a promotion that if one buys 6 muffins or more, they get a 10% discount on muffins.

Since 8 muffins qualifies for the 6 muffins or more promotion, the cost of 8 muffins is reduced by 10%. The discount is $1.25 * 8 * 0.10 = $1.00. Thus, 8 muffins cost $1.25 * 8 - $1.00 = $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00. Two loaves of sourdough cost $10 * 2 = $20.00.

From the ratio of sugar to water (51:5), we have s/w = 51/5. From the ratio of milk to water (7 tablespoons milk : 5 cups water), we have m/w = 7/5. From the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons cream : 1 teaspoon sugar), we have c/s = 2/1 or c = 2s. We are given that the total quantity of ingredients is 220: s + w + m + c = 220.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Emma's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk, in minutes? **Answer:** Before the injury, Emma walked 14 kilometers on the beach in some amount of time *t*. Since her speed is halved after the injury (), she now takes twice as long, 2*t, to walk the same distance on the beach (). We are told this time is 56 minutes. So, 2*t = 56 minutes, which means t = 28 minutes. This was her time on the beach *before* the injury. Her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was three times her speed on the beach (). So, if it took her 28 minutes to walk the 14 km on the beach, it would have taken her 28 / 3 = 9.33 minutes to walk 14 km on the sidewalk at that faster pace (before the injury). Since the sidewalk portion of her walk is 18 km (), not 14 km, we can set up a proportion to find the pre-injury sidewalk time: (9.33 minutes / 14 km) = (x minutes / 18 km) Solving for x, we get approximately 12 minutes. This was her sidewalk time before the injury. After the injury, her speed was halved on *both* the beach and the sidewalk (). So, her beach time is now 28 minutes * 2 = 56 minutes (as given - ). Her sidewalk time is now 12 minutes * 2 = 24 minutes. Therefore, her total walking time after the injury is 56 minutes + 24 minutes = 80 minutes.

Qasim collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.3 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week? **Answer:** 1. **Apartments in the last complex:** The first 4 complexes have a total of 4 * 100 = 400 apartments.

However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? **Answer:** First, we need to figure out Chen's weekly collection rate during the first 5 weeks. She collected a total of 36 signatures over 5 weeks, meaning she averaged 36 / 5 = 7.2 signatures per week. Next, we calculate how many signatures Chen will collect in the remaining 4 weeks. Her collection rate is reduced by 5 signatures per week, so she will now collect 7.2 - 5 = 2.2 signatures per week. Over the next 4 weeks, she'll collect 2.2 * 4 = 8.8 signatures. Since signatures must be whole numbers, we round this down to 8 signatures. Now, let's determine how many signatures they have in total so far. Chen has 36 and Tara has 32, totaling 36 + 32 = 68 signatures. Adding Chen's expected 8 additional signatures from the next 4 weeks, they will have 68 + 8 = 76 signatures. They want to reach 140 signatures total. This means Tara needs to collect the remaining 140 - 76 = 64 signatures.

Gabrielle's flowers grow 3 meters wide so she needs to leave 15 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Gabrielle already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs $3 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a $8 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Gabrielle spend at the store to fill up her flower bed? **Answer:** 1. **Calculate the space each plant needs:** Each plant requires 3 meters (for its width) plus 15 meters of space between it and the next plant, totaling 3 + 15 = 18 meters. 2. **Determine how many plants can fit:** The flower bed is 150 meters long. Divide the total length by the space needed for each plant: 150 / 18 = 8.33. Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, Gabrielle can fit a maximum of 8 plants. 3. **Calculate how many plants Gabrielle needs to buy:** Gabrielle already has 7 flowers and needs 8 total, so she only needs to purchase 8 - 7 = 1 plant. 4. **Calculate the cost:** One plant costs $3. Since she's only buying one plant, she does *not* qualify for the $8 discount (as that requires purchasing more than 2 plants). 5. **Final cost:** Gabrielle will spend $3 at the store.

Due to the natural disaster, 30 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 3 weeks. **Answer:** 1. **Initial unoccupied rooms:** The clinic has a capacity of 1600 rooms. One-tenth (1/10) are occupied, meaning 1600 * (1/10) = 160 rooms are occupied. Two-fifths (2/5) are out of service, meaning 1600 * (2/5) = 640 rooms are out of service. Initially, the number of unoccupied rooms is 1600 - 160 - 640 = 800. 2. **Rooms occupied after 3 weeks:** There are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days. 30 patients are admitted each day, so 21 days * 30 patients/day = 630 new patients are admitted. 3. **Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:** We assume each patient occupies one room. After 3 weeks, the number of occupied rooms will be 160 (initially occupied) + 630 (newly admitted) = 790 rooms. The number of unoccupied serviceable rooms will be 1600 - 640 (out of service) - 790 (occupied) = 170 rooms. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms (including those out of service) after 3 weeks is 170 (serviceable unoccupied) + 640 (out of service) = 810 rooms.

She also uses 6 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use? Answer: Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream. From the ratio of sugar to water (48:10), we have s/w = 48/10. This simplifies to w = (10/48)s = (5/24)s. From the ratio of milk to water (6 tablespoons for every 10 cups), we have m/w = 6/10. This means m = (3/5)w. Substituting the expression for 'w' in terms of 's', we get m = (3/5)*(5/24)s = (1/8)s. From the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon), we have c/s = 2/1. So, c = 2s. We are given that the total quantity of ingredients used is 210. Therefore, s + w + m + c = 210. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get: s + (5/24)s + (1/8)s + 2s = 210 Multiplying throughout by 24 to eliminate fractions: 24s + 5s + 3s + 48s = 5040 70s = 5040 s = 5040 / 70 s = 72 Therefore, Olga used 72 teaspoons of sugar.

If the city is 72 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city? **Answer:** The fog bank covers 10 miles in 75 minutes. This means it covers 1 mile in 75/10 = 7.5 minutes. We want to know how long it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. The city is 72 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is (1/4) * 72 = 18 miles. The problem mentions a change in wind speed after one hour (60 minutes). However, since we are calculating the time to cover only 18 miles, and at the initial speed the fog covers 10 miles in 75 minutes (which is more than an hour), the change in wind speed is irrelevant for this part of the question.

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. Half of the soccer players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition? **Answer:** First, we calculate the number of soccer players in the class: 150 students * 40% = 60 soccer players. However, half of these soccer players are absent, so 60 / 2 = 30 soccer players are going to the competition. Next, we determine the number of students who are not soccer players: 150 students - 60 soccer players = 90 students. Of these remaining students, 30% are dancers or choir members: 90 students * 30% = 27 dancers/choir members. So, the total number of students from the three groups (leaving early for the competition) is 30 soccer players + 27 dancers/choir members = 57 students. Finally, we add the cheerleaders: 3 groups * 3 cheerleaders/group = 9 cheerleaders.

Sakura weighs 130 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 175 calories in ice cream. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura? **Answer:** Theo's daily calorie target is 250 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3750 calories. He has a net calorie consumption of 1100 calories - 150 calories = 950 calories. This means he can still consume 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories. Sakura's daily calorie target is 130 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 1950 calories. She has consumed 900 calories + 175 calories = 1075 calories. This means she can still consume 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories. Each serving of cookies has 175 calories, and a bag contains 5 servings, totaling 175 * 5 = 875 calories per bag. Since a bag is 125 oz, each serving is 125 oz / 5 servings = 25 oz. Theo can consume 2800 more calories, so he can eat 2800 calories / 175 calories/serving = 16 servings of cookies. This translates to 16 servings * 25 oz/serving = 400 oz of cookies. Since a bag is 125 oz, this is more cookies than we have information for. So we focus on how much he *can* eat from what is available: 125 oz. Sakura can consume 875 more calories, which is exactly the number of calories in a 125 oz bag of cookies (5 servings at 175 calories/serving). Therefore, Sakura can eat 125 oz of cookies. The difference in the amount of cookies they can consume is 125 oz (Theo) - 125 oz (Sakura) = 0 oz.

However, during the remaining 3 weeks, Mei is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Haruka decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Haruka need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? **Answer:** First, we need to figure out Mei's current collection rate. She collected 24 signatures over 5 weeks, so her current rate is 24 / 5 = 4.8 signatures per week. Next, we calculate Mei's reduced collection rate. Due to only collecting signatures on weekends, her rate decreases by 5 signatures per week, so her new rate will be 4.8 - 5 = -0.2 signatures per week. Since she can't collect negative signatures, we assume she collects 0 signatures during these weeks. Now, let's determine how many signatures Mei will collect in the remaining 3 weeks. At her reduced collection rate, she collects 0 signatures/week * 3 weeks = 0 signatures. We know they want to reach 135 signatures total. They currently have 24 (Mei) + 51 (Haruka) = 75 signatures. So, they need 135 - 75 = 60 more signatures. Since Mei will collect 0 additional signatures, Haruka needs to collect all the remaining 60 signatures in the remaining 3 weeks.

However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Zahra decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? **Answer:** First, we need to figure out Uma's average weekly signature collection rate during the first 6 weeks. She collected 29 signatures over 6 weeks, meaning she collected 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. Next, we determine how many signatures Uma will collect during the remaining 4 weeks. Due to her reduced collection ability, she will collect 4.83 - 5 = -0.17 signatures per week. Since she can't collect negative signatures, we can assume she collects 0 signatures in the last 4 weeks. Her total collected will remain at 29. Now we calculate how many signatures Zahra needs to collect in total. Together they want 130 signatures, and Uma will have 29, so Zahra needs to collect 130 - 29 = 101 signatures in total. Finally, we figure out Zahra's required weekly collection rate. She already has 37 signatures, so she needs to collect an additional 101 - 37 = 64 signatures over the remaining 4 weeks. This means she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

Ava recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 350. How many bouncy balls came in the tube? Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is 44 blocks + 7 stuffed animals = 51 items. Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. So, there are 2 * 51 = 102 action figures.

The total cost of the folders is 12 folders * $13 = $156. The cost of the ream of bond paper is $14. The total cost of the pencils is 8 pencils * $11 = $88. So, the total cost without any discount is $62 + $156 + $14 + $88 = $320. If Sanjay becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay a one-time $20 fee. The total discount will be 20% of $320, which is 0.2 * $320 = $64. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $320 - $64 + $20 = $276. If Sanjay does not become a member, he will get only a 5% discount. The total discount will be 5% of $320, which is 0.05 * $320 = $16. So, the total cost without the membership discount is $320 - $16 = $304. Since $276 is less than $304, the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything is $276. The answer is {276}.",276.0,True,835,False,symbolic,276.0

What is the least amount James can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items James bought. The cost of the notebooks is 6 notebooks * ¥7.0 = ¥42. The cost of the pencils is 14 pencils * ¥10.0 = ¥140. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ¥24. The cost of the markers is 6 markers * ¥9 = ¥54. The total cost is ¥42 + ¥140 + ¥24 + ¥54 = ¥260. If James becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay a one-time ¥20 fee. The discount amount will be ¥260 * 0.20 = ¥52. So, the total amount James will have to pay as a member is ¥260 - ¥52 + ¥20 = ¥228. If James does not become a member, he will receive only a 5% discount. The discount amount will be ¥260 * 0.05 = ¥13. So, the total amount James will have to pay as a non-member is ¥260 - ¥13 = ¥247.

Ali can either pay a one-time €20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Ali can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the markers is 24 * €4.0 = €96. The cost of the rulers is 4 * €13.5 = €54. The cost of the ream of bond paper is €13. The cost of the colored pencils is 7 * €11 = €77. So, the total cost without any discount is €96 + €54 + €13 + €77 = €240. Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €240, which is €240 * 0.05 = €12. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €240 - €12 = €228. Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time €20 fee. The discount amount is 20% of €240, which is €240 * 0.20 = €48. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €240 - €48 = €192. Adding the one-time €20 fee, the total cost is €192 + €20 = €212.

After 30 minutes from the start of the call, the price drops even more to $0.1 per two minutes. If your total bill is more than $15, you get a 15% discount on your total bill. How much would a 90-minute call cost? Answer: The call can be divided into three parts: the first 10 minutes, the next 30-10=20 minutes, and the last 90-30=60 minutes. For the first 10 minutes, the cost is $0.9 per minute * 10 minutes = $9. For the next 20 minutes, the cost is $0.4 per minute * 20 minutes = $8. For the last 60 minutes, since the price is $0.1 per two minutes, we need to divide the time by 2 to get the number of 2-minute intervals, which is 60/2 = 30 intervals. The cost for this part is $0.1 per two minutes * 30 intervals = $3. The total cost before discount is $9 + $8 + $3 = $20. Since the total bill is more than $15, we get a 15% discount on the total bill, which is $20 * 0.15 = $3. So, the final cost is $20 - $3 = $17. The answer is {17}.",17.0,True,442,False,symbolic,17.0

What is the least amount Diego can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of erasers is 20 erasers * €2.25 = €45. The total cost of colored pencils is 8 colored pencils * €14.25 = €114. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is €21. The total cost of crayons is 5 crayons * €8 = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €45 + €114 + €21 + €40 = €220. If Diego becomes a member and pays the one-time €20 fee, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases. The total discount will be €220 * 0.20 = €44. So, the total cost with the membership discount is €220 - €44 = €176. Adding the one-time €20 fee, the total cost with membership is €176 + €20 = €196. If Diego does not become a member, he will receive only a 5% discount. The total discount will be €220 * 0.05 = €11. So, the total cost without membership is €220 - €11 = €209.

How many marked balls are there in total? Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since a quarter of the balls are tennis balls, the number of tennis balls is 240 * 1/4 = 60. The rest are golf balls, so there are 240 - 60 = 180 golf balls. Next, we need to find out how many blue tennis balls are marked. Since 1/6 of the tennis balls are blue, the number of blue tennis balls is 60 * 1/6 = 10. And since a tenth of those blue tennis balls are marked, the number of marked blue tennis balls is 10 * 1/10 = 1. Now, we need to find out how many gray golf balls are marked. Since 1/2 of the golf balls are gray, the number of gray golf balls is 180 * 1/2 = 90. And since all except 1/6 of those gray balls are marked, the number of marked gray golf balls is 90 - 90 * 1/6 = 90 - 15 = 75.

How much would a 105-minute call cost? Answer: To calculate the cost of the call, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 15 minutes, the next 20 minutes, and the remaining 70 minutes. The first 15 minutes cost €0.8 per minute, so the total cost for this part is €0.8 * 15 = €12. The next 20 minutes cost €0.7 per minute, so the total cost for this part is €0.7 * 20 = €14. The remaining 70 minutes are charged at a rate of €0.4 per two minutes, which is equivalent to €0.2 per minute. So, the total cost for this part is €0.2 * 70 = €14. The total cost of the call is €12 + €14 + €14 = €40. Since the total bill is more than €15, we get a 20% discount on the total bill. The discount amount is €40 * 0.2 = €8.

In addition, Luis owns a 9-square meter apricot field that produces 13 apricots per square meter. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more grapes does Luis harvest than apricots? Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years. Since Luis can harvest his grapes every 12 months, he can harvest twice in two years. The number of grapes per square meter is 16 grapes per five-sixths of a square meter, so the number of grapes per square meter is 16 / (5/6) = 16 * 6 / 5 = 96 / 5 = 19.2 grapes per square meter. Therefore, the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years is 2 * 60 square meters of grape field * 19.2 grapes per square meter = 2 * 60 * 19.2 = 2304 grapes. Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years. Since the apricots can be harvested every 4 months, Luis can harvest 6 times in two years. The total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years is 6 * 9-square meter apricot field * 13 apricots per square meter = 6 * 9 * 13 = 702 apricots. Finally, we subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of grapes to find the difference. The difference is 2304 - 702 = 1602.

A quarter of the tennis balls are purple, and all except a tenth of those purple balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total? Answer: There are half of 240 balls = 240/2 = 120 golf balls. A tenth of the golf balls are brown, so there are 120/10 = 12 brown golf balls. Of those, 1/3 are marked, so there are 12/3 = 4 marked brown golf balls. There are 240 - 120 = 120 tennis balls. A quarter of the tennis balls are purple, so there are 120/4 = 30 purple tennis balls.

How much would a 115-minute call cost? Answer: The call can be divided into three parts: the first 10 minutes, the next 35 - 10 = 25 minutes, and the remaining 115 - 35 = 80 minutes. For the first 10 minutes, the cost is ¥0.6 per minute * 10 minutes = ¥6. For the next 25 minutes, the cost is ¥0.4 per minute * 25 minutes = ¥10.

If the cupcake cost ¥7 and the banana pie cost ¥20, what was Leon's average daily earning? Answer: On Friday, Leon sold 21 boxes of cupcakes and 25 - 12 = 13 boxes of banana pie. On Saturday, he sold 21 + 11 = 32 boxes of cupcakes and 25 boxes of banana pie. On Sunday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, so he sold (21 + 32) boxes of cupcakes and (13 + 25) boxes of banana pie.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget? Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is 20% of the selling price of $590000, which is 0.2 x $590000 = $118000. So, the discounted selling price is $590000 - $118000 = $472000. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 x $590000 = $17700. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $590000 = $70800. However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $472000 + $17700 + $70800 = $560500. Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's $490000 budget. The difference is $560500 - $490000 = $70500.

She also uses 10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use? Answer: Let's assume that Elena used x sets of the ratio of 44:11 for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Then, she used 44x teaspoons of sugar and 11x cups of water. Since she uses 10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water, she used 11x * (10/10) = 11x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, she used 44x * 2 = 88x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 210. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 44x + 11x + 88x + 11x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 154x = 210. Dividing both sides by 154, we get x = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a set). Since x represents the number of sets of the ratio, we multiply x by 44 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 1 * 44 = 44. The answer is {44}.",60.0,False,241,False,symbolic,44.0

Due to the pandemic, 45 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 2 weeks. Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since 1/3 of the rooms are occupied, the number of occupied rooms is 1900 * 1/3 = 633.33, which we will round down to 633 rooms. Next, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since one-sixth of all the rooms are out of service, the number of rooms out of service is 1900 * 1/6 = 316.67, which we will round down to 316 rooms. Now, we can find the initial number of unoccupied rooms. This is 1900 - 633 - 316 = 951 rooms. Since 45 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 45 * 14 = 630 patients. Assuming each patient occupies one room, the number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks is 951 - 630 = 321 rooms. The answer is {321}.",320.0,False,1257,False,symbolic,321.0

If Mrs. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget? Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is 20% of the selling price of $450000, which is 0.2 * $450000 = $90000. So, the discounted selling price is $450000 - $90000 = $360000. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 * $450000 = $13500. The transfer fee is 14% of the selling price, which is 0.14 * $450000 = $63000. However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

In addition, Xavier owns a 11-square meter plum field that produces 13 plums per square meter. The plums can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums? Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are 13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With 65 square meters of apple field, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every 6 months, he can harvest twice in a year, and in two years, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples. Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With 11-square meter plum field and 13 plums per square meter, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every 4 months, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in two years, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums. Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of apples and plums harvested in two years.

Since Luis' friends will cover the cost of all the food for the conference, which is ¥20 * 2 = ¥40, Luis only needs to pay ¥380 - ¥40 = ¥340. Luis has ¥10, so he still needs ¥340 - ¥10 = ¥330. The youth club will cover a quarter of the remaining cost of the conference, which is ¥330 / 4 = ¥82.50. Therefore, Luis still needs ¥330 - ¥82.50 = ¥247.50. The answer is {247.50}.",245.0,False,1558,False,symbolic,247.5
34,405B,"Reformatted Question: Dr. Johnson sold his apartment for $780000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 1% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. He also paid $490000 for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and $10000 for closing costs. Dr. Johnson used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Johnson's net proceeds after two years? Answer: Dr. Johnson paid 1% of the selling price in legal fees, which is 0.01 * $780000 = $7800. He also paid 4% of the selling price in realtor fees, which is 0.04 * $780000 = $31200. Adding these fees to the $490000 remaining loan amount and the $10000 closing costs, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $7800 + $31200 + $490000 + $10000 = $538000. Subtracting this amount from the $780000 selling price, Dr. Johnson's initial net proceeds were $780000 - $538000 = $242000. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years, so the net proceeds after two years were $242000 * (1 + 0.10)^2 = $242000 * 1.1^2 = $242000 * 1.21 = $292820.

19,405B,"Reformatted Question: In a 80-item quiz, 25% of the questions are physics, 10% are biology, and the rest are equally divided as algebra and geometry questions. If Kayla is sure to get 25% of the biology questions, 65% of the physics questions, and a quarter of the algebra and geometry questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get? Answer: First, we need to find the number of questions for each subject. The number of physics questions is 80 * 0.25 = 20. The number of biology questions is 80 * 0.10 = 8. The number of algebra and geometry questions is 80 - 20 - 8 = 52, and since they are equally divided, there are 52/2 = 26 questions for each subject. Now, let's calculate the number of correct answers for each subject. For biology, Kayla will get 25% of 8 questions correct, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2. For physics, Kayla will get 65% of 20 questions correct, which is 0.65 * 20 = 13. For algebra and geometry, Kayla will get a quarter of 26 questions correct for each subject, which is 0.25 * 26 = 6.5 for each subject. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we'll round down to 6 correct answers for each subject. In total, Kayla will get 2 + 13 + 6 + 6 = 27 questions correct. Therefore, she is sure to get 27 points. The answer is {27}.",28.0,False,869,False,symbolic,27.0
13,405B,"Reformatted Question: Gabrielle is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 28 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 90 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Gabrielle remain with? Answer: Gabrielle originally had 10 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges, so she had 10 * 56 = 560 potted plants. She received 28 new potted plants and purchased 90 new plants at a 50% discount, which means she purchased 90 * 0.5 = 45 plants. So, she had 560 + 28 + 45 = 633 potted plants. She decided to give 3 potted plants from each ledge, so she gave 3 * 56 = 168 potted plants away. Therefore, she will remain with 633 - 168 = 465 potted plants.

32,405B,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Smith is looking for a new house that will not go beyond her $400000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $580000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget? Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is 20% of the selling price of $580000, which is 0.2 * $580000 = $116000. So, the discounted selling price is $580000 - $116000 = $464000. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 * $580000 = $17400. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $580000 = $69600. However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $464000 + $17400 + $69600 = $550000. Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's $400000 budget. The difference is $550000 - $400000 = $150000. The answer is {150000}.",133600.0,False,1442,False,symbolic,150000.0
17,405B,"Reformatted Question: Nia walks 24 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Nia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Nia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk, in minutes? Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks 10 kilometers in 60 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 10 kilometers / 60 minutes = 1/6 kilometers per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute. We also know that Nia walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk 14 kilometers on the sidewalk. Time = distance / speed = 14 kilometers / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes. Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = 60 minutes + 42 minutes = 102 minutes. The answer is {102}.",81.0,False,753,False,symbolic,102.0

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the science fair. Diego has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover a tenth of the remaining cost of the science fair. How much money is Diego still missing? Answer: The total cost of the science fair is ($150 + $40 + $30) * 2 days = $440. Since Diego's friends will cover the cost of all the food for the science fair, which is $40 * 2 days = $80, Diego only needs to cover $440 - $80 = $360. Diego has $40, so he still needs $360 - $40 = $320. The school will cover a tenth of the remaining cost of the science fair, which is $320 / 10 = $32. Therefore, Diego is still missing $320 - $32 = $288. The answer is {288}.",284.0,False,1562,False,symbolic,288.0

Due to the major accident, 85 patients are admitted into the medical center each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the medical center after 2 weeks. Answer: The number of occupied beds is 1700 * 1/8 = 212.5 beds. Since we can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 212 beds. The number of beds out of service is 1700 * 1/8 = 212.5 beds. Again, we'll round down to 212 beds. The total number of unavailable beds is 212 + 212 = 424 beds. The number of available beds is 1700 - 424 = 1276 beds. The number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 85 patients per day * 14 days = 1190 patients. The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 1276 - 1190 = 86 beds.
