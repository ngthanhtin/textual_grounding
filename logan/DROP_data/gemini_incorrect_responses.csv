The population density was 73 people per square mile (28/km²).  There were 12,064 housing units at an average density of 36 per square mile (14/km²).  The racial makeup of the county was <fact1>97.90% White</fact1>, <fact2>0.56% African American</fact2>, <fact3>0.15% Native American</fact3>, <fact4>0.28% Asian</fact4>, <fact5>0.02% Pacific Islander</fact5>, <fact6>0.36% from Race (United States Census)</fact6>, and <fact7>0.74% from two or more races</fact7>. <fact8>Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.93% of the population</fact8>. 21.3% were of English people, 16.5% Germans, 11.4% Irish people, 10.7% United States, 5.3% danish people and 5.3% Italian people ancestry according to Census 2000. How many people, in terms of percentage, were not solely White or solely African American?


Answer: The question asks for the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American.  We are given the following percentages:
* <fact1>White: 97.90%</fact1>
* <fact2>African American: 0.56%</fact2>
* <fact3>Native American: 0.15%</fact3>
* <fact4>Asian: 0.28%</fact4>
* <fact5>Pacific Islander: 0.02%</fact5>
* <fact6>Other Race: 0.36%</fact6>
* <fact7>Two or more races: 0.74%</fact7>
* <fact8>Hispanic/Latino: 0.93%</fact8>

The question is asking for everyone *except* those solely identified as White or solely identified as African American.  We can find this by adding all the other percentages or by subtracting the White and African American percentages from 100%.

Adding all the other percentages:  0.15 + 0.28 + 0.02 + 0.36 + 0.74 + 0.93 = 2.48%

Subtracting White and African American from 100%: 100 - 97.90 - 0.56 = 1.54%


Note: The provided percentages don't sum to 100%, which might be intentional to reflect some level of overlapping identifications (like being both White and Hispanic). The prompt doesn't explicitly say whether Hispanic/Latino is a racial classification in the context of this particular census data, so there is potential ambiguity around the <fact8>0.93% Hispanic/Latino</fact8> statistic.

Since the question asks for people not solely identified as White or African American, the most accurate method, given this ambiguity and the fact that the categories don't neatly sum to 100%, is to sum the explicitly non-White, non-African American percentages, ignoring the potentially overlapping Hispanic/Latino statistic. Therefore:

0.15 + 0.28 + 0.02 + 0.36 + 0.74  = 1.55%

Final Answer: {1.55}

Answer: The question asks the difference between the second largest and second smallest ancestry groups.  The passage lists ancestries in descending order.
<fact2>The second largest group is Guyanese at 12.3%</fact2>.
<fact4>The second smallest group listed is Polish at 5.4%</fact4>.

12.3% - 5.4% = 6.9%

So the answer is {6.9}.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković.

The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as offensive tackle Kareem McKenzie missed the game with a groin injury. McKenzie returned the following week. How many interceptions did Arizona catch?


**Answer:** The question asks how many interceptions *Arizona* caught. The passage states that there was <fact1>one interception by Terrell Thomas</fact1>, which resulted in a Giants touchdown.  It also mentions <fact2>three interceptions thrown by Manning</fact2> and that the game ended on an <fact3>interception by Antrel Rolle</fact3>. Since Manning was the Giants' quarterback, and Rolle plays for the Giants, the <fact2>three interceptions of Manning</fact2> and the <fact3>interception by Rolle</fact3> were all caught by Arizona. Therefore, Arizona caught 3 + 1 = 4 interceptions.  So the answer is {4}.

Answer: The passage says the lease was renegotiated in <fact2>2010</fact2> and extended <fact3>until 2042</fact3>, with an option for 5 more years <fact4>until 2047</fact4>.  2042 - 2010 = 32 years. Including the optional 5 years, the renegotiated lease was for 32 + 5 = 37 years.

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>the garrisons in Calais and Brest cost £36,000 a year</fact1>. <fact2>Military expeditions could consume £50,000 in six months</fact2>.
