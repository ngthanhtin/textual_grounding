The medium blue circle is positioned such that the big black square is to its left and above it, and the big blue square is also above and to the left of it. Therefore, the medium blue circle is below both the big black square and the big blue square. Since Block A is below Block B, the small yellow circle in Block A is below the big blue square in Block B. Thus, the big blue square is above a small thing (the small yellow circle in Block A).

Therefore, medium blue square number one is below another medium blue square (medium blue square number two), while the medium blue square in Block C is not below any other square. Thus, the correct answer is option 1.<br><br>Final_Answer: {1}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>1</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>
