How many games does Steve have after 3 years?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: Initially, Steve receives <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">5 games for his birthday</span>. In the first year, he buys <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">1 game per month</span>, which totals 1 x 12 = 12 games. In the second year, he buys <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">2 games per month</span>, which totals 2 x 12 = 24 games. Additionally, he receives <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">5 games for Christmas every year</span>, so he gets 5 games in the first year and 5 games in the second year, totaling 10 games. In the third year, he buys <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">4 games a month</span>, which totals 4 x 12 = 48 games, and he receives another 5 games for Christmas. Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 5 (initial) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 10 (Christmas in first and second year) + 48 (third year) + 5 (Christmas in third year) = 104 games.<br><br>Final_Answer: {104}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>104</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 104</div></div>

It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?</div><div class='full-response'>Reformatted_Question: Billy is <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">peeling and cutting potatoes</span> in preparation for <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">making potato salad</span> for his <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">big family reunion barbecue</span>.

It takes him <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">a minute and a half</span> (which is 90 seconds) to peel each potato and <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">5 seconds</span> to cut each one. Therefore, the total time to prepare one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. For <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">60 potatoes</span>, the total time is 60 x 95 = 5700 seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60, resulting in 5700/60 = 95 minutes.

Therefore, the discounted price per CD is $15 x (1 - 0.40) = $9. James spent 10 x $9 = $90 on the CDs. He sold <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">5 of them</span> for <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$40</span>.

The school auditorium has <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">4 rows of seats</span>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium: <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">18 seats in each row</span> x <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">4 rows</span> = 72 seats. Next, determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators: <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One-fourth of the seats</span> = 72 / 4 = 18 seats. Subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total seats to find the remaining seats: 72 - 18 = 54 seats. Then, calculate how many of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents: <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">One-third of the remaining seats</span> = 54 / 3 = 18 seats. Finally, subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by the students: 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Each square inch of the mosaic requires <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">twelve glass chips</span>. Therefore, the total area Milo can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches. Since the mosaic is <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">three inches tall</span>, the length of the mosaic can be calculated by dividing the total area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

How many miles does the last dog need?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: According to the information, Bernie has <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4 dogs</span>. The first dog needs to walk <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">1 mile</span>, the second dog needs to walk <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">4 miles</span>, and the third dog needs to walk <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">3 miles</span>. The average distance they need to walk is <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">3 miles per day</span>. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first calculate the total miles needed for all dogs to meet the average: 4 dogs x 3 miles = 12 miles.

She gathers <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">half this amount from the shortest trees</span>, which is 30/2 = 15 apples.

How much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: First, convert the width of each flower from inches to feet: <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">12 inches</span> is 1 foot. The total space each plant occupies is the width of the plant plus the space between plants: 1 foot + <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">1.5 feet</span> = 2.5 feet per plant. To find out how many plants Pat needs, divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies: <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">111 feet</span> / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4, which rounds up to 45 plants (since you can't have a fraction of a plant). Pat already owns <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">17 flowers</span>, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more plants.

How much will it cost to fill the pool?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: To find the volume of the pool, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = width x length x depth.

The east and west walls are <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">5 x 8 feet</span>. How much will it cost to paint the room?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the area of the north and south walls. Each wall is <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">10 x 8 feet</span>, so the area of one wall is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet. Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls. Each wall is <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">5 x 8 feet</span>, so the area of one wall is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since a gallon of paint covers <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">20 square feet</span>, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: Jim starts with <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">20 pieces of gum</span>. During the school day, he chews <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">1 piece for every 2 hours</span>, so he chews 8/<span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">2</span> = 4 pieces at school.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags.

How much money is used?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate how long Jack can play. Since <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">they play for 4 hours</span>, Jack can play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. According to <fact2>, Jack uses 1 quarter for every 20 minutes, so he uses 240/20 = 12 quarters. <br><br>Next, consider the two friends who are worse than Jack. According to <fact4>, they can only play half as long as Jack, so they play for 240/2 = 120 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 120/20 = 6 quarters. Since there are two friends, they use 6 x 2 = 12 quarters in total.<br><br>Finally, consider the friend who is better than Jack. According to <fact7>, this friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 x 1.5 = 360 minutes. This friend uses 360/20 = 18 quarters.<br><br>Adding up all the quarters used: Jack uses 12 quarters, the two worse friends use 12 quarters, and the better friend uses 18 quarters.

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: <br><br>1. Calculate the cost of the pins: <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2 seniors will receive pins</span> at $5 each, so the cost for pins is 2 x $5 = $10.<br><br>2. Calculate the cost of the picture frames: <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">44 seniors</span> each receive a picture frame costing <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$20</span>. The total cost for the frames is 44 x $20 = $880.<br><br>3. Calculate the additional cost for etching the frames: The etching cost is <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">20% of the frame cost</span>. So, the etching cost per frame is 20% of $20 = $4. The total etching cost is 44 x $4 = $176.<br><br>4. Calculate the cost of the cords: <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">1/4 of the seniors are officers</span>, so 44/4 = 11 officers. Each officer receives a cord costing <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">$12</span>, so the total cost for cords is 11 x $12 = $132.<br><br>5.

How many slices of pizza were left?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: There are <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Bryce and four of his friends</span>, so there are 5 pizzas in total. Each pizza has <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">12 slices</span>, so there are 5 x 12 = 60 slices in total. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Bryce and two friends</span> ate <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">2/3 of their pizzas</span>.

How many trees does he have left?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: Tom starts with <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">50 trees</span>. Over 10 years, he plants <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">10 trees a year</span>, so he plants 10 x 10 = 100 trees.

Over the 10 years, he chops down <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">2 trees a year</span>, so he chops down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of eggs hidden by Cole: <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">3 dozen eggs</span> = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">5 eggs</span>.

How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact1>, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. From <fact2>, half of them were Trekking bikes, so 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes were sold. From <fact3>, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so 300 x 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes were sold. According to <fact4>, the rest were MTB bikes, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes were sold. From <fact5>, the price of one MTB is $500, so Marcel earned 105 x $500 = $52,500 from MTB bikes. From <fact6>, BMX is half the price of an MTB, so the price of one BMX is $500/2 = $250, and Marcel earned 45 x $250 = $11,250 from BMX bikes. From <fact7>, a Trekking bike is $450, so Marcel earned 150 x $450 = $67,500 from Trekking bikes. Therefore, Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles during that month were $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.<br><br>Final_Answer: {131250}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>131,250</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 131,250</div></div>

Therefore, a normal student spends 6 x 40 = 240 minutes in class per day. John takes <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">2 extra classes a day</span>, so he spends an additional 2 x 40 = 80 minutes per day.

Since there are six tests and the lowest score is removed, the average is calculated over five tests. Therefore, the total score needed for an average of 93 is 93 x 5 = 465.<br><br>Brinley's current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71, which will be removed.

There are 5280 feet in a mile. Therefore, Tim's distance is <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">2 miles</span> x 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. Steve's distance is <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">3 miles</span> x 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet. <br><br>Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home. Tim's time is 10560 feet / <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">264 feet per minute</span> = 40 minutes. Steve's time is 15840 feet / <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">440 feet per minute</span> = 36 minutes.<br><br>Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner.

The company <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars</span>. How much did he make?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total sales revenue from the cars. James sold <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">10 cars</span> at <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">$25,000 each</span>, so the total sales revenue is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000. The company paid <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">30% of the price to acquire the cars</span>, which means the cost to acquire the cars is 30% of $250,000 = $75,000. The profit is the total sales revenue minus the acquisition cost, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000. James earns a <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">10% commission on the profits</span>, so he makes 10% of $175,000 = $17,500.<br><br>Final_Answer: {17,500}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>17,500</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 17,500</div></div>
