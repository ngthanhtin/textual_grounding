    "You are a helpful assistant tasked with highlighting key facts in text. Given a question and answer pair, you need to identify distinct sections of the text that were needed to answer the question. You are only concerned with identifying excerpts of the text that are ESSENTIAL to answering the question. You should ignore irrelevant information that does not help answer the final question. You should extract the exact parts of the text, not summarized versions of the text. After you have decided what specific quotes to use, tag the original question and answer with xml tags around those quotes. The xml tags should follow the format of <fact1>, <fact2>, etc. Here is what your response should look like:\n",

    "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a bus, a motorcyle, a hatchback, a station wagon, a minivan, a truck, and a limousine. The station wagon is the fourth-newest. The motorcyle is newer than the truck. The station wagon is older than the hatchback. The minivan is newer than the hatchback. The bus is newer than the minivan. The truck is newer than the limousine.\n",

    "Answer: To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts:\n",
    "1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest**: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon.\n",
    "2. **The motorcycle is newer than the truck**: This indicates that the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age.\n",
    "3. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback**: This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon.\n",
    "4. **The minivan is newer than the hatchback**: This places the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age.\n",
    "5. **The bus is newer than the minivan**: This means the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback.\n",
    "6. **The truck is newer than the limousine**: This indicates that the limousine is older than the truck.\n",
    "Now, let's summarize the order based on the information:\n",
    "- Since the station wagon is the fourth-newest, we can denote the order as follows:\n",

Adding the $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents to the $50 she already has, Betty now has $50 + $15 + $30 = $95. Since the wallet costs $100, she still needs $100 - $95 = $5 more to buy the wallet.\n",
