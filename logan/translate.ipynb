Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?\n",
    "Answer: Sam completes a widget every 10 minutes. \n",
    "When Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget.\n",
    "Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = 36 widgets.\n",
    "Jack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = 16 widgets.\n",
    "Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets.\n",
    "It took Tony 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = 8*60/16=30 minutes per widget.\n",

    "Answer: There are 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $6 for the cans. There are 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected. So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $6 for the newspapers.

The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?\n",
    "Answer: The mileage cost for the first apartment will be 31*20*0.58 = $359.60\n",
    "This makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.60 + 800 + 260 = $1419.60\n",
    "Similarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be 21*20*0.58 = $243.60\n",

Ellie says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors she saw her reflection 3 times. They both passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each and they both passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each. In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?\n",
    "Answer: In the rooms with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 10 reflections * 3 passes = 30 times.\n",
    "In the rooms with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 5 reflections * 5 passes = 25 reflections.\n",

    "In the rooms with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 3 reflections * 5 passes = 15 times.\n",

Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?\n",
    "Answer: The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = 90 peppers for very spicy curries.\n",
    "They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = 60 peppers for spicy curries.\n",
    "They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 10 peppers for mild curries.\n",
    "So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers.\n",
    "They now buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries = 30 peppers for spicy curries.\n",
    "They also now buy 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = 90 peppers for mild curries.\n",
    "So they now buy 30 + 90 = 120 peppers.\n",

When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute.  But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute.

During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?\n",
    "Answer: The first 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50*15=750 feet.\n",
