How many percent more people were in the the second largest group compared to the second smallest?

Answer: The question asks the difference between the second largest and second smallest ancestry groups.  The passage lists ancestries in descending order.
<fact2>The second largest group is Guyanese at 12.3%</fact2>.
<fact4>The second smallest group listed is Polish at 5.4%</fact4>.

12.3% - 5.4% = 6.9%

So the answer is {6.9}.

The Giants scored first, sending Jacobs in for a 4-yard touchdown run following a Terrell Thomas interception. Later, Arizona running back Beanie Wells scored his first career touchdown on a 13-yard rush. Manning responded by throwing a 62-yard touchdown to Nicks for his longest reception of the year. In the second half, the Cardinals' Tim Hightower and Jason Wright scored touchdowns. But it was turnovers that decided this game; Manning's 3 interceptions were as many as he had thrown all season. The Giants scored only 3 points in the second half, ending the game on an interception to Antrel Rolle. The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as offensive tackle Kareem McKenzie missed the game with a groin injury.

The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as offensive tackle Kareem McKenzie missed the game with a groin injury. McKenzie returned the following week. How many interceptions did Arizona catch?


**Answer:** The question asks how many interceptions *Arizona* caught. The passage states that there was <fact1>one interception by Terrell Thomas</fact1>, which resulted in a Giants touchdown.  It also mentions <fact2>three interceptions thrown by Manning</fact2> and that the game ended on an <fact3>interception by Antrel Rolle</fact3>. Since Manning was the Giants' quarterback, and Rolle plays for the Giants, the <fact2>three interceptions of Manning</fact2> and the <fact3>interception by Rolle</fact3> were all caught by Arizona. Therefore, Arizona caught 3 + 1 = 4 interceptions.  So the answer is {4}.

**Answer:** We are looking for the number of times the entrant count exceeded 760 between the <fact1>2008-09</fact1> and <fact3>2011-12</fact3> FA Cups.  The passage tells us there were <fact2>759 entrants in the 2010-11 FA Cup</fact2>.  Since 759 is not over 760, there were zero seasons with more than 760 entrants between 2008-09 and 2011-12.

history_1665_d6089739-9950-4c32-86a2-d64fbef8cbdf,"In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne. Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.
