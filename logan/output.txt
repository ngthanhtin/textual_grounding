Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block A has a medium blue square. Below block A is block B which has <fact1>one medium black square</fact1>. To the left of block B there is block C which has <fact2>two medium blue squares</fact2>. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? a medium blue square that is in block A or a medium blue square number two?
(a) medium blue square that is in block A
(b) medium blue square number two
(c) both of them
(d) none of them
Answer: Block A has a medium blue square, and Block B (below A) has a <fact1>black square</fact1>. Block C, <fact3>to the left of Block B</fact3>, has <fact2>two medium blue squares</fact2>, with blue square number two on top and number one below it. Since the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B.
The answer is {B}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle, we need to focus on the relative positions of the objects in blocks A and B. Specifically, we need to identify the positions of the small yellow triangles in block A and the small blue triangle and circle in block B. The key facts are the presence of the small yellow triangles in block A, the position of block B relative to block A, and the positions of the small blue triangle and circle within block B.

Question: We have two blocks. Lets call them A and B. There are <fact1>two small yellow triangles in block A</fact1>. Small yellow triangle number one is above and near to small yellow triangle number two. <fact2>To the right of block A there is block B</fact2> which contains <fact3>one small blue triangle</fact3>. To the left of and far from a small blue circle is a big blue circle. It is above the small blue triangle. The <fact4>small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block</fact4>. <fact5>To the right of the small blue triangle is the small blue circle</fact5>. Which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle? the small blue circle or the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block?
(a) the small blue circle
(b) the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block
(c) both of them
(d) none of them
Answer: In block A, there are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1>. <fact2>To the right of block A</fact2>, block B contains a <fact4>small blue triangle touching the bottom edge</fact4> and a <fact5>small blue circle to its right</fact5>. Since both the small blue circle and the small blue triangle are to the right of the small yellow triangles.
The answer is {C}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is above the big black triangle, we need to focus on the relative positions of the blocks and the shapes within them. Specifically, we need to identify the contents of Block B and Block C, as Block B contains the big black triangle, and Block C is directly above Block B.

(a) small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block
(b) big yellow triangle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A contains a <fact1>small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge</fact1>, and Block C (<fact3>above Block B</fact3>) contains <fact4>two big yellow triangles</fact4>, with <fact6>big yellow triangle number one above big yellow triangle number two</fact6>. Since <fact3>Block C is directly above Block B</fact3> (<fact2>which contains the big black triangle</fact2>), the object above the big black triangle is a <fact4>big yellow triangle</fact4>.
The answer is {B}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine which object is to the left of the small yellow triangle, we need to focus on the relative positions of the blocks and the objects within them. The key facts are the positions of Block A and Block B, and the contents of these blocks. Specifically, we need to know that Block A is to the left of Block B, and that Block A contains the small yellow circle while Block B contains the small yellow triangle.

Block A contains a medium yellow triangle and a <fact3>small yellow circle</fact3>. The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and above the small yellow circle. <fact4>Block B contains one small yellow triangle</fact4>. And block C contains one medium yellow circle, one medium black circle and one small black circle. A medium blue circle is near to the small black circle. This object is near to and to the left of the medium yellow circle which is to the right of, near to and above the medium black circle. It is above the medium black circle. Which object is to the left of a small yellow triangle? the small yellow circle or the medium yellow circle?
(a) the small yellow circle
(b) the medium yellow circle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A contains a <fact3>small yellow circle</fact3>, and <fact4>Block B contains a small yellow triangle</fact4>. Since <fact2>Block A is to the left of Block B</fact2>, and the small yellow circle is in Block A, it is to the left of the small yellow triangle. The medium yellow circle, which is in Block C, is above and to the right of the small yellow triangle, but not to the left of it.
The answer is {A}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is below the big black triangle, we need to identify the relative positions of the blocks and the objects within them. The key facts are the positions of Block A and Block B, and the contents of each block. Specifically, we need to know that Block A is below Block B and that Block A contains a big black square.

Answer: <fact2>Block A, which is below Block B</fact2>, contains <fact1>a big black square</fact1>. Since the <fact3>big black triangle is in Block B</fact3> and Block A is directly below Block B, the object directly below the big black triangle is the big black square in Block A.
The answer is {A}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is to the right of the big blue square, we need to identify the location of the big blue square and the positions of the medium yellow circle and square. The big blue square is in Block B, and the medium yellow circle and square are in Block C, which is below Block A. Therefore, neither the medium yellow circle nor the medium yellow square is to the right of the big blue square.
