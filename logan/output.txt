Answer: Block A contains a <fact1>small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge</fact1>, and Block C (above Block B) contains <fact3>two big yellow triangles</fact3>, with big yellow triangle number one above big yellow triangle number two. Since Block C is directly above Block B (which contains the <fact2>big black triangle</fact2>), the object above the big black triangle is a big yellow triangle. The answer is {B}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
The question asks which object is to the left of a small yellow triangle. To answer this, we need to know the relative positions of the small yellow circle and the medium yellow circle in relation to the small yellow triangle. The key facts are:
1. Block A contains a small yellow circle.
2. Block B contains a small yellow triangle.
3. Block A is to the left of Block B.
4. The medium yellow circle is in Block C and is above and to the right of the small yellow triangle.

These facts are essential to determine the relative positions of the objects in question.
