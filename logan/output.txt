### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is to the left of the black thing, we need to focus on the spatial arrangement of the blocks and the squares within them. Specifically, we need to identify the position of the black square and what is directly to its left. The key facts are the positions of the blocks and the squares within them.

Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block A has a medium blue square. Below block A is block B which has <fact1>one medium black square</fact1>. To the left of block B there is block C which has <fact2>two medium blue squares</fact2>. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? a medium blue square that is in block A or a medium blue square number two?
(a) medium blue square  that is in block A
(b) medium blue square  number two
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A has a medium blue square, and Block B (below A) has a <fact1>black square</fact1>. Block C, <fact2>to the left of Block B</fact2>, has two medium blue squares, with blue square number two on top and number one below it. Since the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B.
The answer is {B}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle, we need to focus on the relative positions of the objects in blocks A and B. Specifically, we need to identify the positions of the small yellow triangles in block A and the small blue triangle and small blue circle in block B.

Question: We have two blocks. Lets call them A and B. There are <fact1>two small yellow triangles in block A</fact1>. Small yellow triangle number one is above and near to small yellow triangle number two. To the right of block A there is block B which contains <fact2>one small blue triangle</fact2>. To the left of and far from a small blue circle is a big blue circle. It is above the small blue triangle. The <fact3>small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block</fact3>. To the right of the small blue triangle is the <fact4>small blue circle</fact4>. Which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle? the small blue circle or the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block?
(a) the small blue circle
(b) the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: In block A, there are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1>. To the right of block A, block B contains a <fact2>small blue triangle</fact2> <fact3>touching the bottom edge</fact3> and a <fact4>small blue circle to its right</fact4>. Since both the <fact4>small blue circle</fact4> and the <fact2>small blue triangle</fact2> are to the right of the <fact1>small yellow triangles</fact1>.
The answer is {C}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is above the big black triangle, we need to focus on the relative positions of the blocks and the shapes within them. The key information is the arrangement of blocks A, B, and C, and the contents of each block. Specifically, we need to know what is in Block B and what is directly above it in Block C.

Question: There are three blocks. We call them A, B and C. Block A contains two big black circles. There is also a <fact1>small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge of this block</fact1>. Big black circle number two is touching the right edge of this block. Big black circle number one is to the left of and near to big black circle number two. This shape is above the small yellow triangle. <fact2>Above block A is block B with a big black triangle in it</fact2>. <fact3>Above block B there is block C</fact3>. It contains <fact4>two big yellow triangles</fact4>. Big yellow triangle number one is touching the right edge of this block. It is above big yellow triangle number two. What is above the big black triangle? a small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block or a big yellow triangle?
(a) small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block
(b) big yellow triangle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A contains a <fact1>small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge</fact1>, and Block C (<fact3>above Block B</fact3>) contains <fact4>two big yellow triangles</fact4>, with big yellow triangle number one above big yellow triangle number two. Since Block C is directly <fact3>above Block B</fact3> (<fact2>which contains the big black triangle</fact2>), the object above the big black triangle is a <fact4>big yellow triangle</fact4>.
The answer is {B}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine which object is to the left of the small yellow triangle, we need to identify the positions of the small yellow circle and the medium yellow circle relative to the small yellow triangle. The key facts are the locations of the small yellow circle and the small yellow triangle, as well as the relative positions of the blocks.

Block A contains a medium yellow triangle and a <fact3>small yellow circle</fact3>. The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and above the small yellow circle. Block B contains one <fact4>small yellow triangle</fact4>. And block C contains one medium yellow circle, one medium black circle and one small black circle. A medium blue circle is near to the small black circle. This object is near to and to the left of the medium yellow circle which is to the right of, near to and above the medium black circle. It is above the medium black circle. Which object is to the left of a small yellow triangle? the small yellow circle or the medium yellow circle?
(a) the small yellow circle
(b) the medium yellow circle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A contains a <fact3>small yellow circle</fact3>, and Block B contains a <fact4>small yellow triangle</fact4>. Since Block <fact2>A is to the left of Block B</fact2>, and the <fact3>small yellow circle</fact3> is in Block A, it is to the left of the <fact4>small yellow triangle</fact4>. The medium yellow circle, which is in Block C, is above and to the right of the small yellow triangle, but not to the left of it.
The answer is {A}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is below the big black triangle, we need to identify the relative positions of the blocks and the objects within them. The key facts are the positions of Block A and Block B, and the contents of each block. Specifically, we need to know that Block A is below Block B and that Block A contains a big black square.

The answer is {A}.
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine what is to the right of the big blue square, we need to identify the positions of the relevant objects in relation to each other. The key facts are the location of the big blue square in Block B and the positions of the medium yellow circle and square in Block C. We need to establish that Block C is below Block A and not to the right of Block B.

A big yellow circle is to the left of the medium black circle. The medium black circle is touching the right edge of this block. To the left of the medium black circle there is the big blue circle. It is below the yellow object which is to the left of the medium black circle. To the left of block A we have <fact1>block B with a big blue square in it</fact1>. Below block A there is <fact2>block C which has a medium yellow square</fact2>. This block also has one <fact3>medium yellow circle</fact3>. Above the medium yellow square there is the medium yellow circle. What is to the right of the big blue square? a medium yellow circle or a medium yellow square?
(a) medium yellow circle
(b) medium yellow square
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: <fact1>Block B contains the big blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block C, which is below Block A, contains both the medium yellow square</fact2> and the <fact3>medium yellow circle</fact3>. Since the medium yellow circle is above the medium yellow square and both are located in Block C, which is below Block A, neither of these objects is directly to the right of the big blue square in Block B.
The answer is {D}.
