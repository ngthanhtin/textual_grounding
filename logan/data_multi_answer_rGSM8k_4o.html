At least how many degrees is the second bottle?</div><div class='full-response'><span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>. He has two mugs of water. <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</span> into his water bottle and <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">one ounce from the other bottle</span>, <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">he is now able to drink the water</span>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that allows Donny to drink the water mixture, which must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Problem:**<br>   - <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>.<br>   - He has two mugs of water. <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>.<br>   - The other mug has an unknown temperature.<br>   - He pours <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</span> into his water bottle.<br>   - He also pours <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">one ounce from the other bottle</span>.<br>   - <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">He is now able to drink the water</span>.<br><br>2. **Setting Up the Equation:**<br>   - The total mixture is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, making a total of 5 ounces.<br>   - Let \( x \) be the temperature of the second mug.<br>   - The average temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>3. **Calculating the Average Temperature:**<br>   - The formula for the average temperature of the mixture is:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5} \geq 40<br>     \]<br>   - Simplifying the equation:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40<br>     \]<br>   - Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:<br>     \[<br>     132 + x \geq 200<br>     \]<br>   - Solve for \( x \):<br>     \[<br>     x \geq 200 - 132<br>     \]<br>     \[<br>     x \geq 68<br>     \]<br><br>4. **Conclusion:**<br>   - The temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is {68}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>68</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 68</div></div>

How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.<br><br>1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**<br>   - The plane cost is given as <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$150,000</span>.<br><br>2. **Monthly Hanger Rent:**<br>   - James pays <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$5000 a month to rent a hanger</span>.<br><br>3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**<br>   - James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on the hanger rent.

Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, Steve's distance in feet is:<br>     \[<br>     3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}<br>     \]<br>   - Tim lives 2 miles from the school. His distance in feet is:<br>     \[<br>     2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}<br>     \]<br><br>2. **Calculate Time for Each to Get Home:**<br>   - Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. The time it takes for Steve to get home is:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}<br>     \]<br>   - Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. The time it takes for Tim to get home is:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}<br>     \]<br><br>3. **Determine the Waiting Time:**<br>   - Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the faster one. The waiting time for Steve before Tim finishes is:<br>     \[<br>     40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}<br>     \]<br><br>Therefore, the winner, Steve, will be waiting for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the selling price of the boards after the price increase and then subtract the original cost.<br><br>1. **Original Cost Calculation:**<br>   - Sasha has <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each</span>. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is 10 boards * $10/board = $100.<br>   - She also has <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each</span>. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is 5 boards * $16/board = $80.<br>   - The total original cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.<br><br>2. **Selling Price Calculation:**<br>   - The prices for lumber have gone up <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">50%</span>. Therefore, the selling price for each type of board will be 150% of the original price.<br>   - The selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 * 1.50 = $15. For ten boards, the total selling price is 10 boards * $15/board = $150.<br>   - The selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 * 1.50 = $24. For five boards, the total selling price is 5 boards * $24/board = $120.<br>   - The total selling price for all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.<br><br>3. **Profit Calculation:**<br>   - Profit is calculated as the total selling price minus the total original cost.<br>   - Profit = $270 (total selling price) - $180 (total original cost) = $90.<br><br>Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of {90}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>90</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 90</div></div>

How many trees does he have left?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:<br><br>1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">50 trees</span>.<br><br>2. **Net Trees Added Each Year**: Each year, Tom plants <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">10 trees</span> and chops down <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2 trees</span>. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.<br><br>3. **Total Trees After 10 Years**: Over <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">10 years</span>, the net increase in trees is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.<br><br>4. **Trees Dying After 10 Years**: After 10 years, <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">30% of the trees die</span>. Therefore, the number of trees that die is 30% of 130, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.<br><br>5. **Final Number of Trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees gives us 130 - 39 = 91 trees.<br><br>Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has {91} trees left.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>91</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 91</div></div>

The <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">first scene has twice the number of lines</span>, but <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">only a third of them are his lines</span>. The <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">second scene has six more lines than the song</span>, and <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">four-fifths of them are his</span>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines he has in each part of his performance.<br><br>1. **Solo Song:**<br>   - The solo song has <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">54 lines</span>. Since Sean has to memorize all the lines of his solo song, he needs to memorize 54 lines from the song.<br><br>2. **First Scene:**<br>   - The first scene has <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">twice the number of lines</span> as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has 54 * 2 = 108 lines.<br>   - Sean's lines in the first scene are <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">only a third of them</span>. So, Sean has 108 / 3 = 36 lines to memorize from the first scene.<br><br>3. **Second Scene:**<br>   - The second scene has <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">six more lines than the song</span>. Therefore, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.<br>   - Sean's lines in the second scene are <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">four-fifths of them</span>. So, Sean has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines to memorize from the second scene.<br><br>Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:<br>- Solo Song: 54 lines<br>- First Scene: 36 lines<br>- Second Scene: 48 lines<br><br>Total lines Sean has to memorize = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.<br><br>Therefore, Sean has to memorize {138} lines.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>138</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 138</div></div>

How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we will use the information provided in the data tags step by step.<br><br>1. **First Week:**<br>   - According to <data1>, after the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.<br><br>2. **Second Week:**<br>   - In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. So, we take the height from the first week and double it: <br>     - 3 inches (from the first week) * 2 = 6 inches.<br>   - Therefore, after the second week, the beanstalk was 6 inches tall.<br><br>3. **Third Week:**<br>   - In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches, as stated in <data3>.<br>   - We add this growth to the height at the end of the second week:<br>     - 6 inches (from the second week) + 4 inches = 10 inches.<br><br>Thus, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

How many toys in total does James need?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many toys James needs in total, let's break down the situation step by step using the provided data:<br><br>1. **Initial Situation:**<br>   - <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</span>. This means initially, there is a 1:1 ratio of toys to dogs.<br><br>2. **First Change:**<br>   - <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</span>. This means there are now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs in total.<br>   - To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 12 toys in total. Since he already has 4 toys, he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.<br><br>3. **Second Change:**<br>   - After buying the toys, <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</span>. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.<br>   - To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.<br><br>4. **Third Change:**<br>   - <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">3 dogs were gone</span>, so there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.<br>   - To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys and actually has 3 extra toys.<br><br>Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21. <br><br>The answer is {21}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>21</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 33</div></div>

After she returned the item, she bought a <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00</span> and a <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">set of towels that was 10% off $30.00</span>. She put both of these purchases on her credit card. What is the new balance on her credit card?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:<br><br>1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$85.00 worth of merchandise</span> on her credit card.<br><br>2. **Return of an Item**: She returned an item that cost <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$15.00</span>. This means the amount charged on her credit card is reduced by $15.00. So, the balance after the return is:<br>   \[<br>   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00<br>   \]<br><br>3. **Purchase of Frying Pan**: Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">20% off $20.00</span>. The discount on the frying pan is:<br>   \[<br>   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, the sale price of the frying pan is:<br>   \[<br>   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00<br>   \]<br><br>4. **Purchase of Towels**: She also bought a set of towels that was <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">10% off $30.00</span>. The discount on the towels is:<br>   \[<br>   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, the sale price of the towels is:<br>   \[<br>   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00<br>   \]<br><br>5. **Total New Purchases**: The total cost of the new purchases (frying pan and towels) is:<br>   \[<br>   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00<br>   \]<br><br>6. **New Balance on Credit Card**: Adding the cost of the new purchases to the balance after the return gives us the new balance on the credit card:<br>   \[<br>   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is {113.00}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>113.00</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 113</div></div>

This is the total amount he earned for the entire week.<br><br>To find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week, we divide the total earnings by the amount earned per branch:<br><br>Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Earnings per branch<br>Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25<br><br>Calculating this gives us:<br><br>Total branches climbed = 420<br><br>Since a week typically consists of 7 days, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:<br><br>Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week<br>Average branches per day = 420 / 7<br><br>Calculating this gives us:<br><br>Average branches per day = 60<br><br>Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the data tags.<br><br>1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).<br><br>2. According to <data1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).<br><br>3. According to <data2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).<br><br>4. According to <data3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:<br>   \[<br>   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>   \]<br><br>5. Simplifying the equation:<br>   \[<br>   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19<br>   \]<br><br>6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:<br>   \[<br>   4x + x + 8 = 38<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   5x + 8 = 38<br>   \]<br><br>7. Subtract 8 from both sides:<br>   \[<br>   5x = 30<br>   \]<br><br>8. Divide by 5:<br>   \[<br>   x = 6<br>   \]<br><br>9. Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:<br>   \[<br>   x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>10</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 10</div></div>

How much money will she have left for her clothing?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract it from her budget.<br><br>1. Start with Elvira's total budget: <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">€1500</span>.<br><br>2. Calculate the total cost of the items she purchased:<br>   - The computer with accessories costs: <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">€1090</span>.<br>   - The scanner costs: <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">€157</span>.<br>   - The CD burner costs: <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">€74</span>.<br>   - The printer costs: <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">€102</span>.<br><br>3.

Perform the addition:<br>   - Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.<br><br>5. Subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she has left:<br>   - Money left = €1500 (budget) - €1423 (total cost).<br><br>6.

If <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</span>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider the following information:<br><br>1. <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">It takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</span>. This means Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.<br><br>2. <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</span>. Since Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, Bernadette's drive will take 4 times 4 minutes, which is 16 minutes.<br><br>3. <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</span>. This means Bernadette needs to complete her journey 5 minutes earlier than Wayne.<br><br>Now, let's calculate the time difference in their departure times:<br><br>- Wayne's total time to arrive at the theater is 4 minutes.<br>- Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to complete her 16-minute drive 5 minutes before Wayne's 4-minute drive ends.<br><br>To achieve this, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes (her drive time) + 5 minutes (to arrive earlier) = 21 minutes before Wayne.<br><br>Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

So, she needs installation for 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.<br>   - Chandeliers: Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the package includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs installation for 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.<br>   - Pictures: Angela has 20 pictures, and the package includes 10 pictures. So, she needs installation for 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.<br><br>4. **Total Additional Items**:<br>   - Total additional items = 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 additional items.<br><br>5. **Cost for Additional Items**:<br>   - The cost for additional items is <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$15.00 per item</span>.

How much is the boat worth after the three years?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially to the initial purchase price.<br><br>1. **Initial Purchase Price**: <br>   - <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Gary bought a boat for $9000</span>.<br><br>2. **First Year Depreciation**:<br>   - The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year.<br>   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.<br>   - Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.<br><br>3. **Second Year Depreciation**:<br>   - The boat depreciated by another 30% in the second year.<br>   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.<br>   - Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.<br><br>4. **Third Year Depreciation**:<br>   - The boat depreciated by 20% in the third year.<br>   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.<br>   - Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.<br><br>Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years of depreciation. The final answer is {3528}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>3528</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 3528</div></div>

What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, let's go through the information step by step:<br><br>1. **Initial Balloons:**<br>   - Sally initially had <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">25 red balloons</span>, <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">7 green balloons</span>, and <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">12 yellow balloons</span>.<br><br>2. **Red Balloons Burst:**<br>   - A gust of wind caused <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">40% of the red balloons to burst</span>.<br>   - 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.<br>   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.<br><br>3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**<br>   - Sally accidentally <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">released half of the yellow balloons</span>.<br>   - Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.<br>   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.<br><br>4. **Blue Balloons Added:**<br>   - Sally found <span class="data6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">8 blue balloons caught in a tree</span>.<br>   - She <span class="data7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">added 75% of them</span> to her remaining balloons.<br>   - 75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.<br><br>5. **Total Balloons Carried into School:**<br>   - Total balloons = Remaining red balloons + Green balloons + Remaining yellow balloons + Added blue balloons.<br>   - Total balloons = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34 balloons.<br><br>Therefore, Sally finally carried {34} balloons into the school.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>34</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 34</div></div>
