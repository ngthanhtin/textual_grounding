We have three blocks: A, B, and C.<br>2. <important1>Block C is below A</span>.<br>3. <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Block A is above B</span>.<br>4. <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Block A contains one medium blue square</span>.<br>5. <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">Block B has two medium yellow squares</span>.<br>6. <span class="important5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">A medium black square is also in this block</span>.<br>7. <span class="important6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">This shape is below medium yellow square number two</span>.<br>8. <span class="important7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</span>.<br>9. <span class="important8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">It is below medium yellow square number two and the medium black square</span>.<br><br>From the information above, we can deduce the following:<br><br>- Block A contains a medium blue square, and it is above Block B.<br>- Block B contains two medium yellow squares and a medium black square.<br>- The shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is below both medium yellow square number two and the medium black square.<br><br>Since Block A is above Block B, the medium blue square in Block A is above all the objects in Block B. Therefore, both medium yellow square number two and the shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block B are below the medium blue square in Block A.<br><br>Thus, the answer is {2}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>
