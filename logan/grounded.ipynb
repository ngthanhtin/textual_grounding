Your goal is to analyze the input question, identify distinct key points needed to answer the question, and then wrap each of these points in custom HTML-like tags like <fact1>, <fact2>, <fact3>, etc and then use these tags to answer the question. After you have tagged the question in tags, use these tags in your reasoning process to answer the question. The <fact> tags should be interweaved in the sentences in your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read and Understand the Input Question**:\n",
    "   - Carefully analyze the input question to understand its context.\n",
    "   - Identify distinct facts, entities, or concepts that contribute to the meaning of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Key Points (Facts)**:\n",
    "   - Each distinct and meaningful segment of the question that provides important information should be considered a \"fact.\"\n",
    "   - This can include the subject, object, context, or any qualifiers that make the question specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tag Each Fact**:\n",
    "   - Assign a unique tag to each fact in the form <fact1>, <fact2>, etc.\n",
    "   - Wrap each identified key point in these tags.\n",
    "   - The tags should start from <fact1> for the first key point, and increment for each new fact identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Formatting Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Maintain the original structure of the question as much as possible.\n",
    "   - Make sure each tag encapsulates the entire key point clearly without splitting phrases unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Question:\n",
    "\"Does climate change positively affect polar bear populations in the Arctic? Anwser Options: Yes, No, Depends\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Identification:\n",
    "1. Fact 1: \"Climate change\" (main topic causing the effect)\n",
    "2. Fact 2: \"Polar bear populations\" (who is affected)\n",
    "3. Fact 3: \"In the Arctic\" (the location/context)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reformatted Output:\n",
    "\"How does <fact1>climate change</fact1> affect <fact2>polar bear populations</fact2> in <fact3>the Arctic</fact3>?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer Reasoning\n",
    "\"<fact1>Climate change</fact1> primarily affects <fact2>polar bears</fact2> through the loss of <fact3>sea ice</fact3>, which is crucial for their hunting and survival. As <fact3>Arctic ice</fact3> melts earlier and forms later due to <fact1>rising temperatures</fact1>, <fact2>polar bears</fact2> face reduced access to their main prey (seals), leading to nutritional stress, longer fasting periods, and <fact2>overall population decline</fact2>. The impact of <fact1>climate change</fact1> on <fact2>polar bear populations</fact2> is therefore negative, so the answer is {No}\"\n",

    "- Grammatically correct.\n",

    "Each tag should be named according to the type of information it represents. There are multiple distinct types of tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <person> for people or characters\n",
    "- <location> for places or regions\n",
    "- <number> for numerical values\n",
    "- <time> for time-related information\n",
    "- <concept> for abstract ideas\n",
    "- <object> for physical things\n",

    "## Tagging Examples \n",
    "\n",
    "### Person Example\n",
    "For the text \"Adam worked as a volunteer firefighter in order to help serve his community.\", you would tag the text as follows: \"<person>Adam worked as a volunteer firefighter</person> in order to help serve his community.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The text in the <person> tag should include key information relevant to that person. While acceptable, it does not always need to be just their name. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Location Example\n",
    "For the text \"What is the capital of France?\", you would tag the question as follows: \"What is the <location>capital of France</location>?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number Example\n",
    "For the text \"The average temperature in the desert is 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\", you would tag the text as follows: \"The average temperature in the desert is <number>110 degrees Fahrenheit</number>.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The text in the <number> tag should include any information relevant to a quantity of something. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Example\n",
    "For the text \"The earliest recorded human writing was composed nearly 4,000 years ago, sometime around 2000 B.C.\" would be tagged as \"The earliest recorded human writing was composed nearly <time1>4,000 years</time1> ago, sometime around <time2>2000 B.C.</time2>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept Example\n",
    "For the text \"The field of machine learning is a rapidly growing area of study.\", you would tag the text as follows: \"The field of <concept>machine learning</concept> is a rapidly growing area of study.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Example\n",
    "For the text \"The astronaut used a special tool to repair the damaged satellite.\", you would tag the text as follows: \"The astronaut used a <object1>special tool</object2> to repair the <object2>damaged satellite</object2>.\"\n",
