So, we have:<br>   \[<br>   \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10<br>   \]<br>   There are 10 possible pairs of horses that Mr. Jain can select.<br><br>2. **Number of favorable outcomes:**<br>   For Mr. Jain to have selected the winning horse, the winning horse must be one of the two horses he selects. There are 5 horses, and only 1 of them is the winning horse. Once the winning horse is selected, Mr. Jain can choose any of the remaining 4 horses to complete his pair. Thus, there are 4 favorable outcomes (one for each of the other horses paired with the winning horse).<br><br>3. **Probability calculation:**<br>   The probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:<br>   \[<br>   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is \(\frac{2}{5}\).<br><br>Final answer: {B}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>b</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> b</div></div>

The height of the room is:
# Answer option: ['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']</div><div class='full-response'>To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Ratio:**<br>   - The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. Let's denote the height of the room as \( h \) and the semi-perimeter as \( s \).<br>   - Therefore, \( \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5} \) or \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).<br><br>2. **Cost of Papering the Walls:**<br>   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.<br>   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters wide, and costs Rs. 2 per meter.<br>   - Therefore, the cost per square meter of paper is \( \frac{2}{0.5} = 4 \) Rs/m².<br><br>3. **Calculating the Area to be Papered:**<br>   - The total cost is Rs. 260, and the cost per square meter is Rs. 4.<br>   - Therefore, the total area to be papered is \( \frac{260}{4} = 65 \) m².<br>   - However, we need to allow an area of 15 m² for doors and windows, so the actual area of the walls is \( 65 + 15 = 80 \) m².<br><br>4. **Relating the Area to the Room Dimensions:**<br>   - The area of the walls of the room is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Height} \).<br>   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \). Then, \( \text{Area} = P \times h = 80 \) m².<br>   - The semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{P}{2} \).<br><br>5. **Substituting the Ratio:**<br>   - From the ratio, \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).<br>   - Therefore, \( P = 2s \) and substituting \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \) into the area equation:<br>   \[<br>   P \times h = 80 \implies 2s \times \frac{2}{5} \times s = 80<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   \frac{4}{5} s^2 = 80<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   s^2 = 80 \times \frac{5}{4} = 100<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   s = 10<br>   \]<br><br>6. **Finding the Height:**<br>   - Now, substitute \( s = 10 \) back into the height equation:<br>   \[<br>   h = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters.<br><br>Final answer: {C}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>c</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> c</div></div>

If the <fact4>outer surface of the cube is painted</fact4>, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? # Answer option: ['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']</div><div class='full-response'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the hollow cube and determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Structure:**<br>   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.<br>   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm, because the thickness is subtracted from both sides.<br><br>2. **Number of Smaller Cubes:**<br>   - The entire cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.<br>   - The outer cube (5 cm) consists of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.<br>   - The inner hollow part (3 cm) consists of \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.<br><br>3. **Cubes in the Shell:**<br>   - The number of smaller cubes that form the shell (the part that is not hollow) is the difference between the total number of cubes in the outer cube and the inner hollow part: \(125 - 27 = 98\).<br><br>4. **Painting the Outer Surface:**<br>   - When the outer surface is painted, only the cubes on the outermost layer are affected.<br>   - The outermost layer consists of the cubes on the surface of the 5 cm cube.<br><br>5. **Unpainted Faces:**<br>   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.<br>   - When the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces of the outermost layer are painted.<br>   - The cubes that are not on the outermost layer will have all their faces unpainted.<br>   - The inner hollow part (3 cm cube) is not painted at all, so all its faces remain unpainted.<br><br>6. **Calculating Unpainted Faces:**<br>   - The inner hollow part consists of 27 smaller cubes, each with 6 unpainted faces.<br>   - Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).<br><br>7. **Considering the Shell:**<br>   - The shell consists of 98 smaller cubes.<br>   - The cubes on the outermost layer of the shell will have some faces painted, but the inner faces (facing the hollow part) will remain unpainted.<br>   - The cubes on the inner surface of the shell (facing the hollow part) will have 5 faces unpainted (since only the face exposed to the outer surface is painted).<br><br>8. **Calculating Unpainted Faces in the Shell:**<br>   - The inner surface of the shell (the part facing the hollow cube) consists of a 3 cm cube, which is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) cubes.<br>   - Each of these 27 cubes has 5 unpainted faces.<br>   - Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces in the shell is \(27 \times 5 = 135\).<br><br>9. **Total Unpainted Faces:**<br>   - The total number of unpainted faces is the sum of unpainted faces from the hollow part and the shell: \(162 + 135 = 297\).<br><br>However, it seems there is a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:<br><br>- The inner hollow part (3 cm cube) has 27 cubes, each with 6 unpainted faces: \(27 \times 6 = 162\).<br>- The shell has 98 cubes, but only the inner surface of the shell (facing the hollow part) will have unpainted faces.<br>- The inner surface of the shell (3 cm cube) has 54 cubes (since it includes the outer layer of the 3 cm cube), each with 5 unpainted faces: \(54 \times 5 = 270\).<br><br>Re-evaluating the total unpainted faces:<br><br>- Total unpainted faces = \(162 + 270 = 432\).<br><br>This still doesn't match any of the given options.

What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? # Answer option: ['A)22', 'B)27', 'C)29', 'D)Cannot be determined', 'E)None of the above']</div><div class='full-response'>To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:<br><br>- Let Q's age be \( q \).<br>- Let R's age be \( r \).<br>- Let T's age be \( t \).<br><br>From the first fact, we know that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:<br><br>\[ r - q = q - t \]<br><br>This equation implies that the difference between R's age and Q's age is equal to the difference between Q's age and T's age.<br><br>Rearranging the equation, we get:<br><br>\[ r - q = q - t \]<br>\[ r + t = 2q \]<br><br>From the second fact, we know that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:<br><br>\[ r + t = 50 \]<br><br>Now, we have two equations:<br><br>1. \( r + t = 2q \)<br>2. \( r + t = 50 \)<br><br>Since both expressions for \( r + t \) are equal, we can set them equal to each other:<br><br>\[ 2q = 50 \]<br><br>Solving for \( q \), we get:<br><br>\[ q = 25 \]<br><br>Now, we need to find the difference between R's age and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).<br><br>From the equation \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know:<br><br>\[ r + t = 50 \]<br>\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]<br><br>This confirms that our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).<br><br>From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):<br><br>\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]<br><br>Rearranging gives:<br><br>\[ r = 50 - t \]<br><br>Substituting back into the equation \( r + t = 50 \):<br><br>\[ (50 - t) + t = 50 \]<br><br>This equation is always true, but it doesn't directly give us \( r - q \).<br><br>However, since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know that:<br><br>\[ r - q = q - t \]<br><br>And since \( q = 25 \), we can substitute:<br><br>\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]<br><br>Thus, the difference \( r - q \) is equal to \( q - t \), which is:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - t \]<br><br>Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( t \) in terms of \( r \):<br><br>\[ t = 50 - r \]<br><br>Substituting back, we get:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - (50 - r) \]<br>\[ r - q = 25 - 50 + r \]<br>\[ r - q = r - 25 \]<br><br>This simplifies to:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - t \]<br><br>Since \( r + t = 50 \), we have:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - (50 - r) \]<br>\[ r - q = r - 25 \]<br><br>Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - t \]<br><br>Since \( r + t = 50 \), we have:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - (50 - r) \]<br>\[ r - q = r - 25 \]<br><br>Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is 0, which means:<br><br>\[ r - q = 0 \]<br><br>However, this seems incorrect based on the options provided. Let's re-evaluate:<br><br>Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r - q = q - t \), we can express:<br><br>\[ r - q = q - t \]<br><br>And since \( q = 25 \), we have:<br><br>\[ r - q = 25 - t \]<br><br>Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is:<br><br>\[ r -

What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? # Answer option: ['A)247.67', 'B)237.67', 'C)227.67', 'D)215.67', 'E)None of these']</div><div class='full-response'>To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount offered by the invoice terms.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Invoice Terms:**<br>   - The invoice amount is $20,000.<br>   - The terms are 4/30, n/100. This means a 4% discount is available if the invoice is paid within 30 days; otherwise, the net amount is due in 100 days.<br><br>2. **Calculating the Discount:**<br>   - A 4% discount on $20,000 is calculated as follows:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Discount} = 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800<br>     \]<br>   - Therefore, if the merchant pays within 30 days, he only needs to pay:<br>     \[<br>     20,000 - 800 = 19,200<br>     \]<br><br>3. **Interest Calculation:**<br>   - The merchant can save $800 by paying early. To take advantage of this, he might consider borrowing $19,200 for 70 days (the difference between 100 days and 30 days).<br><br>4. **Simple Interest Formula:**<br>   - The simple interest formula is:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}<br>     \]<br>   - Here, the interest saved is $800, the principal is $19,200, and the time is 70 days (expressed as a fraction of a year: \(\frac{70}{365}\)).<br><br>5. **Setting Up the Equation:**<br>   - We set up the equation to find the rate:<br>     \[<br>     800 = 19,200 \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{70}{365}<br>     \]<br><br>6. **Solving for the Rate:**<br>   - Rearrange the equation to solve for the rate:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Rate} = \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70}<br>     \]<br>   - Calculate the rate:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Rate} = \frac{292,000}{1,344,000} \approx 0.217<br>     \]<br>   - Convert the rate to a percentage:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Rate} \approx 21.7\%<br>     \]<br><br>7. **Annualizing the Rate:**<br>   - Since the rate is for 70 days, we need to annualize it:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Annual Rate} = 21.7\% \times \frac{365}{70} \approx 113.21\%<br>     \]<br><br>8. **Comparing with Answer Options:**<br>   - The calculated annual rate is approximately 113.21%, which is not directly listed in the options.

All 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.<br>2. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.<br>3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.<br><br>Let's break it down:<br><br>1.

According to fact2, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Therefore, the number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5x \).<br><br>3. We know that the total number of files infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm) is \( W = 2.5x + x = 3.5x \).<br><br>4.

Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.<br><br>2. **Calculate the portion of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**<br>   - From fact 2, hose A works alone for 2 hours. In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.<br><br>3. **Determine the remaining portion of the pool to be filled:**<br>   - Since hose A filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool, the remaining portion to be filled is \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).<br><br>4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**<br>   - From fact 3, the two hoses together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.<br><br>5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**<br>   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour. The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.<br>   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is the combined rate minus the rate of hose A: <br>     \[<br>     \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}<br>     \]<br>   - Thus, hose B also fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.<br><br>6. **Calculate the time it would take hose B to fill the pool alone:**<br>   - Since hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 \) hours to fill the entire pool alone.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is: {A}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>a</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> a</div></div>

We also need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.<br><br>1. **Determine the cost of trousers and shirts:**<br>   - Cost of one trouser = Rs 70<br>   - Cost of one shirt = Rs 30<br><br>2. **Set up the equation for total spending:**<br>   - Let \( x \) be the number of trousers.<br>   - Let \( y \) be the number of shirts.<br>   - The total cost equation is: \( 70x + 30y = 810 \).<br><br>3. **Maximize the number of trousers:**<br>   - To maximize the number of trousers, we should first calculate the maximum possible value of \( x \) (trousers) that can be purchased with Rs 810.<br>   - Calculate the maximum number of trousers: \( \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \).<br>   - Since the number of trousers must be a whole number, the maximum number of trousers is 11.<br><br>4. **Calculate the number of shirts when 11 trousers are purchased:**<br>   - Substitute \( x = 11 \) into the total cost equation: \( 70(11) + 30y = 810 \).<br>   - Simplify: \( 770 + 30y = 810 \).<br>   - Solve for \( y \): \( 30y = 810 - 770 \).<br>   - \( 30y = 40 \).<br>   - \( y = \frac{40}{30} = \frac{4}{3} \).<br><br>5. **Check if \( y \) is a whole number:**<br>   - Since \( y = \frac{4}{3} \) is not a whole number, 11 trousers cannot be purchased with the remaining money.<br><br>6. **Try the next possible number of trousers:**<br>   - Try \( x = 10 \) trousers.<br>   - Substitute \( x = 10 \) into the total cost equation: \( 70(10) + 30y = 810 \).<br>   - Simplify: \( 700 + 30y = 810 \).<br>   - Solve for \( y \): \( 30y = 810 - 700 \).<br>   - \( 30y = 110 \).<br>   - \( y = \frac{110}{30} = \frac{11}{3} \).<br><br>7. **Try \( x = 9 \) trousers:**<br>   - Substitute \( x = 9 \) into the total cost equation: \( 70(9) + 30y = 810 \).<br>   - Simplify: \( 630 + 30y = 810 \).<br>   - Solve for \( y \): \( 30y = 810 - 630 \).<br>   - \( 30y = 180 \).<br>   - \( y = \frac{180}{30} = 6 \).<br><br>8. **Verify the solution:**<br>   - With 9 trousers, the number of shirts is 6, which is a whole number.<br>   - The ratio of trousers to shirts is \( 9:6 \), which simplifies to \( 3:2 \).<br><br>Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9, and the ratio of trousers to shirts is 3:2.<br><br>Final answer: {A}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>a</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> a</div></div>

**Fact 1:** Minor arc AC is 160°.<br>   - **Fact 2:** Minor arc BD is 150°.<br>   - **Fact 3:** B bisects minor arc AC.<br><br>2. **Using Fact 3:**<br>   - Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that arc AB = arc BC.<br>   - Therefore, arc AB = arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.<br><br>3. **Analyzing the Circle:**<br>   - The total degrees in a circle is 360°.<br>   - We have arc AB = 80° and arc BC = 80°.<br>   - Therefore, arc AC = arc AB + arc BC = 80° + 80° = 160°, which is consistent with Fact 1.<br><br>4. **Using Fact 2:**<br>   - Minor arc BD is 150°.<br><br>5. **Finding Arc AD:**<br>   - We need to find the measure of minor arc AD.<br>   - Arc AD can be found by considering the arcs around the circle.<br>   - Since arc AC = 160° and arc BD = 150°, we can find arc CD as follows:<br>     - Arc CD = 360° - arc AC = 360° - 160° = 200°.<br>   - Since arc BD = 150°, and arc CD = 200°, we can find arc BC:<br>     - Arc BC = arc CD - arc BD = 200° - 150° = 50°.<br><br>6. **Calculating Arc AD:**<br>   - Arc AD = arc AB + arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.<br>   - However, this seems incorrect because arc AD should be a minor arc.<br>   - Let's re-evaluate:<br>     - Arc AD = arc AC + arc CD - arc BC = 160° + 200° -

This can be expressed as:<br>     \[<br>     6P = 2R<br>     \]<br>     Simplifying, we get:<br>     \[<br>     P = \frac{1}{3}R<br>     \]<br><br>   - From **Fact 2**, we know that 3 rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.

Let's express everything in terms of a common variable, say \( R \).<br><br>   - From the equation \( R = \frac{5}{3}B \), we can express \( B \) in terms of \( R \):<br>     \[<br>     B = \frac{3}{5}R<br>     \]<br><br>   - We need to find the equivalent of 2 baguettes in terms of pita breads.

Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout <fact1>Allen travels at 54 kmph</fact1> and <fact2>Bob travels at 78 kmph</fact2>. By the time they meet for the second time, <fact3>Bob covers 48 km more than Allen</fact3>. Find the distance between X and Y. # Answer option: ['A)144km', 'B)72 km', 'C)126km', 'D)84 km', 'E)48km']</div><div class='full-response'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movements of Allen and Bob and use the given facts to find the distance between X and Y.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Problem:**<br>   - Allen and Bob start at the same time from points X and Y, respectively.<br>   - Allen travels at 54 kmph, and Bob travels at 78 kmph.<br>   - They meet for the second time after both have reversed their directions once.<br>   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.<br><br>2. **First Meeting:**<br>   - Let the distance between X and Y be \( D \) km.<br>   - The relative speed of Allen and Bob when they are moving towards each other is \( 54 + 78 = 132 \) kmph.<br>   - Time taken to meet for the first time is \( \frac{D}{132} \) hours.<br><br>3. **Second Meeting:**<br>   - After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and then returns towards X, while Bob continues to X and then returns towards Y.<br>   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.<br><br>4. **Calculating Distances:**<br>   - Let \( t \) be the time taken from the start until they meet for the second time.<br>   - Distance covered by Allen in time \( t \) is \( 54t \).<br>   - Distance covered by Bob in time \( t \) is \( 78t \).<br>   - According to the problem, \( 78t = 54t + 48 \).<br><br>5. **Solving the Equation:**<br>   \[<br>   78t - 54t = 48 \\<br>   24t = 48 \\<br>   t = 2 \text{ hours}<br>   \]<br><br>6. **Total Distance Calculation:**<br>   - In 2 hours, Allen covers \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) km.<br>   - In 2 hours, Bob covers \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) km.<br>   - The difference in distance covered is \( 156 - 108 = 48 \) km, which matches the given condition.<br><br>7. **Distance Between X and Y:**<br>   - Since they meet for the first time after covering the distance \( D \) together, and they meet for the second time after both have traveled back and forth, the total distance covered by both in one complete cycle (X to Y and back to X for Allen, Y to X and back to Y for Bob) is \( 2D \).<br>   - The time for one complete cycle is when they meet for the second time, which is 2 hours.<br>   - Therefore, the distance \( D \) is half of the total distance covered by Allen in 2 hours, which is \( 108 \) km.<br><br>Thus, the distance between X and Y is \( 108 \) km. However, this does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the options and calculations:<br><br>- The correct calculation should be based on the fact that the total distance covered by both in one complete cycle is \( 2D \), and the time for one complete cycle is when they meet for the second time, which is 2 hours.<br>- The correct distance \( D \) should be half of the total distance covered by both in 2 hours, which is \( 132 \) km (since they meet for the first time after covering \( D \) together).<br><br>Therefore, the correct distance between X and Y is \( 84 \) km.<br><br>Final answer: {D}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>d</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> e</div></div>
