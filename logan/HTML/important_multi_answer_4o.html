This shape is above the circle which is to the right of the small black square.<br><br>Now, let's determine what is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A:<br><br>- Since Block B is directly above Block A, we need to consider the shapes in Block B.<br>- In Block B, the small yellow triangle is touching the right edge and is above the medium blue square. The big blue triangle is to the left of the small yellow triangle and far from the medium blue square.<br>- The small black square is not mentioned to be on the right edge, so it is likely not directly above the medium yellow triangle.<br><br>Since Block C is above Block B, we need to consider the shapes in Block C:<br><br>- The big blue square is near to and below the small black square, and the medium blue circle is to the right of the small black square.<br>- The big blue square is above the medium blue circle.<br><br>Given the arrangement, the medium blue circle in Block C is positioned to the right of the small black square and below the big blue square.

This means that any object in Block B is to the left of any object in Block A.<br><br>2. **Block B**:<br>   - Block B contains two medium yellow squares.

This means Block C is vertically aligned with Block B, but it is not to the left or right of Block B.<br>   - Block C contains a <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">medium blue square</span> and a <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">medium black square</span>. The medium black square is below the medium blue square.<br><br>4. **Relative Position of Squares**:<br>   - Since Block C is directly below Block B, the medium blue and black squares in Block C are not horizontally aligned with the medium yellow squares in Block B. Therefore, they are not to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block B.<br><br>5. **Conclusion**:<br>   - Since Block C is below Block B and not to the left, neither the medium blue square nor the medium black square is to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block B or Block A.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is {3: none of them}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>3</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 3</div></div>
