This means the hawk is in the 6th position.<br>   - The <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">raven is the fourth from the left</span>. This places the raven in the 4th position.<br><br>2. **Positioning the Robin:**<br>   - The <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">robin is the second from the left</span>. This places the robin in the 2nd position.<br><br>3. **Positioning the Cardinal:**<br>   - The <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">cardinal is to the left of the raven</span>. Since the raven is in the 4th position, the cardinal must be in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. However, the robin is already in the 2nd position, so the cardinal can only be in the 1st or 3rd position.<br><br>4. **Positioning the Falcon:**<br>   - The <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">falcon is to the left of the robin</span>. Since the robin is in the 2nd position, the falcon must be in the 1st position.<br><br>5. **Positioning the Cardinal Again:**<br>   - Since the falcon is in the 1st position, the cardinal must be in the 3rd position.<br><br>6. **Positioning the Crow and Blue Jay:**<br>   - The <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">crow is to the right of the blue jay</span>. With the positions 5 and 7 remaining, the blue jay must be in the 5th position and the crow in the 7th position.<br><br>Now, let's summarize the positions:<br>1. Falcon<br>2. Robin<br>3. Cardinal<br>4. Raven<br>5. Blue Jay<br>6. Hawk<br>7. Crow<br><br>According to this arrangement, the robin is the second from the left.<br><br>Therefore, the correct answer is {C}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>c</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> c</div></div>

Next, we need to find the second-cheapest fruit. We know:<br>   - <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">The loquats are the third-cheapest</span>.<br>   - Therefore, the second-cheapest fruit must be more expensive than plums but less expensive than loquats.<br><br>3.

We know that <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">the bus is the newest</span>. Therefore, it must be in the last position (7th).<br><br>2. <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">The truck is the third-newest</span>, which means it is in the 5th position.<br><br>3. <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">The motorcycle is the fourth-newest</span>, placing it in the 6th position.<br><br>4. Now, we have the following positions filled:<br>   - 5th: Truck<br>   - 6th: Motorcycle<br>   - 7th: Bus<br><br>5. Next, we consider the remaining vehicles: minivan, limousine, tractor, and convertible.<br><br>6. <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">The limousine is older than the minivan</span>, so the minivan must be newer than the limousine.<br><br>7. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">The tractor is older than the limousine</span>, so the limousine must be newer than the tractor.<br><br>8. <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">The convertible is older than the tractor</span>, so the tractor must be newer than the convertible.<br><br>9. Based on these facts, the order from oldest to newest for the remaining vehicles is:<br>   - Convertible<br>   - Tractor<br>   - Limousine<br>   - Minivan<br><br>10. Since the truck is the third-newest, it is in the 5th position, and the motorcycle is in the 6th position, the minivan must be in the 4th position.<br><br>11. Therefore, the order from oldest to newest is:<br>   - Convertible<br>   - Tractor<br>   - Limousine<br>   - Minivan<br>   - Truck<br>   - Motorcycle<br>   - Bus<br><br>12. The minivan is in the 4th position, not the 3rd. The truck is in the 5th position, not the 3rd. The motorcycle is in the 6th position, not the 3rd. The bus is in the 7th position, not the 3rd. The convertible is in the 1st position, not the 3rd. The tractor is in the 2nd position, not the 3rd. The limousine is in the 3rd position.<br><br>Therefore, the limousine is the third-newest.

This gives us the following partial arrangement:<br>   ```<br>   _ _ _ _ _ Falcon _<br>   ```<br><br>2. **Positioning the Owl**:  <br>   According to <fact6>, the owl is the third from the left. This gives us:<br>   ```<br>   _ _ Owl _ _ Falcon _<br>   ```<br><br>3. **Positioning the Crow**:  <br>   According to <fact1>, the falcon is to the left of the crow. Since the falcon is second from the right, the crow must be the rightmost bird:<br>   ```<br>   _ _ Owl _ _ Falcon Crow<br>   ```<br><br>4. **Positioning the Hawk**:  <br>   According to <fact5>, the hummingbird is to the left of the hawk. Since the falcon is second from the right and the crow is the rightmost, the hawk must be to the left of the falcon. Therefore, the hawk is the fourth from the right:<br>   ```<br>   _ _ Owl Hawk _ Falcon Crow<br>   ```<br><br>5. **Positioning the Hummingbird**:  <br>   According to <fact3>, the hummingbird is to the right of the quail. Since the hummingbird is to the left of the hawk, it must be the third from the right:<br>   ```<br>   _ _ Owl Hawk Hummingbird Falcon Crow<br>   ```<br><br>6. **Positioning the Quail and Cardinal**:  <br>   According to <fact2>, the quail is to the right of the cardinal. The only remaining positions are the first and second from the left. Therefore, the cardinal is first, and the quail is second:<br>   ```<br>   Cardinal Quail Owl Hawk Hummingbird Falcon Crow<br>   ```<br><br>Now, we can determine which bird is second from the left. According to the arrangement, the quail is second from the left.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is {F}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>f</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> f</div></div>

We know from <fact3> that the apples are the cheapest. So, apples are in the 7th position.<br><br>2. According to <fact2>, the oranges are the third-most expensive. Therefore, oranges are in the 3rd position.<br><br>3. From <fact1>, the loquats are less expensive than the oranges, so loquats cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd positions. <br><br>4. From <fact6>, the loquats are more expensive than the kiwis. Therefore, kiwis must be cheaper than loquats.<br><br>5. From <fact4>, the kiwis are more expensive than the pears. Therefore, pears are cheaper than kiwis.<br><br>6. From <fact5>, the mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons. Therefore, watermelons are cheaper than mangoes.<br><br>Now, let's arrange the fruits based on the information:<br><br>- Apples are the cheapest (7th position).<br>- Pears are cheaper than kiwis, so pears are in the 6th position.<br>- Kiwis are cheaper than loquats, so kiwis are in the 5th position.<br>- Loquats are cheaper than oranges, so loquats are in the 4th position.<br>- Oranges are the third-most expensive (3rd position).<br>- Watermelons are cheaper than mangoes, so watermelons are in the 2nd position.<br>- Mangoes are the most expensive (1st position).<br><br>The order from most expensive to cheapest is:<br>1. Mangoes<br>2. Watermelons<br>3. Oranges<br>4. Loquats<br>5. Kiwis<br>6. Pears<br>7. Apples<br><br>According to this arrangement, the oranges are indeed the third-most expensive.<br><br>Therefore, the correct answer is {C}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>c</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> c</div></div>

We know that <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">the yellow book is the rightmost</span>. This means the yellow book is in the 7th position.<br><br>2. <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">The black book is the fourth from the left</span>. This places the black book in the 4th position.<br><br>3. <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">The brown book is the third from the right</span>. Since the yellow book is in the 7th position, the brown book must be in the 5th position.<br><br>4. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">The green book is to the right of the white book</span>. This means the white book must be placed to the left of the green book.<br><br>5. <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">The blue book is to the right of the green book</span>. This means the green book must be placed to the left of the blue book.<br><br>6. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">The blue book is to the left of the orange book</span>. This means the blue book must be placed to the left of the orange book.<br><br>Now, let's place the books in order:<br><br>- The yellow book is in the 7th position.<br>- The black book is in the 4th position.<br>- The brown book is in the 5th position.<br><br>We need to place the white, green, blue, and orange books in the remaining positions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th.<br><br>- Since the green book is to the right of the white book, and the blue book is to the right of the green book, and the blue book is to the left of the orange book, the only possible order for these four books is: white, green, blue, orange.<br><br>Thus, the final order of the books is:<br><br>1. White<br>2. Green<br>3. Blue<br>4. Black<br>5. Brown<br>6. Orange<br>7. Yellow<br><br>According to this arrangement, the yellow book is the rightmost.

This means the purple book must be placed in a position further left than the green book.<br><br>6. <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">The green book is to the left of the yellow book</span>. This means the green book must be placed in a position further left than the yellow book.<br><br>Given these constraints, let's try to place the remaining books:<br><br>- The blue book must be to the right of the brown book and to the left of the purple book. Let's place the blue book in the third position:<br><br>   Position: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  <br>   Book:     ?  Brown  Blue  ?  ?  ?

On a branch, there are seven birds: a cardinal, a blue jay, a robin, a crow, a falcon, a hawk, and a raven. <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">The hawk is the second from the right</span>. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">The raven is the fourth from the left</span>. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">The robin is the second from the left</span>. <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">The cardinal is to the left of the raven</span>. <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">The falcon is to the left of the robin</span>. <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">The crow is to the right of the blue jay</span>. Options: (A) The cardinal is the fourth from the left (B) The blue jay is the fourth from the left (C) The robin is the fourth from the left (D) The crow is the fourth from the left (E) The falcon is the fourth from the left (F) The hawk is the fourth from the left (G) The raven is the fourth from the left<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to arrange the birds based on the given facts and determine which bird is fourth from the left.<br><br>1. **Initial Placement Based on Key Facts:**<br>   - <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">The hawk is the second from the right</span>. This means the hawk is in the 6th position.<br>   - <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">The raven is the fourth from the left</span>. This places the raven in the 4th position.<br>   - <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">The robin is the second from the left</span>. This places the robin in the 2nd position.<br><br>2. **Placing the Cardinal:**<br>   - <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">The cardinal is to the left of the raven</span>. Since the raven is in the 4th position, the cardinal must be in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. However, the robin is already in the 2nd position, so the cardinal can only be in the 1st or 3rd position.<br><br>3. **Placing the Falcon:**<br>   - <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">The falcon is to the left of the robin</span>. Since the robin is in the 2nd position, the falcon must be in the 1st position.<br><br>4. **Placing the Cardinal Again:**<br>   - With the falcon in the 1st position, the cardinal must be in the 3rd position.<br><br>5. **Placing the Blue Jay and Crow:**<br>   - <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">The crow is to the right of the blue jay</span>. With the hawk in the 6th position and the raven in the 4th position, the crow can only be in the 5th or 7th position. Since the hawk is in the 6th position, the crow must be in the 5th position, and the blue jay must be in the 7th position.<br><br>6. **Final Arrangement:**<br>   - 1st: Falcon<br>   - 2nd: Robin<br>   - 3rd: Cardinal<br>   - 4th: Raven<br>   - 5th: Crow<br>   - 6th: Hawk<br>   - 7th: Blue Jay<br><br>According to this arrangement, the bird that is fourth from the left is the raven.<br><br>Therefore, the correct answer is {G}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>g</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> g</div></div>
