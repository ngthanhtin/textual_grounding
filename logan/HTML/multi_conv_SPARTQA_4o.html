Below medium blue square number three and medium blue square number one there is the medium black square. Then, we have block B with one medium blue square in it. Finally, we have <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">block C which is above both blocks A and B</span>. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">It contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square</span>. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Below the medium yellow square is the medium black square</span>.

This means that any object in block C is positioned above the objects in blocks A and B.<br><br>2. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Block C contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square</span>. <br><br>3. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Below the medium yellow square is the medium black square</span>. This indicates that within block C, the yellow square is directly above the black square.<br><br>Since block C is above both blocks A and B, the objects in block C do not directly interact with the objects in blocks A and B in terms of vertical positioning. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block C is not directly above any medium blue square in block A or block B.<br><br>Thus, the answer to the question "What is below the yellow object?" is that there is no medium blue square directly below the yellow object in block C.

Since Block B is above Block C, the medium yellow square in Block B is not relevant to the question about what is below a medium yellow square.<br><br>4. <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">Block C has two medium blue squares and two other medium yellow squares</span>. This means Block C contains two medium yellow squares, which we will refer to as medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two.<br><br>5. According to <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">Below medium yellow square number two there is medium yellow square number one</span>. This indicates that medium yellow square number one is directly below medium yellow square number two.<br><br>6. Since medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, medium yellow square number one is the object that is below a medium yellow square.<br><br>Therefore, the object below a medium yellow square is medium yellow square number one, which corresponds to medium yellow square number two being above it.

We have two blocks, <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">A and B. Block A is below B</span>. This means Block B is on top, and Block A is underneath it.<br><br>2. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Block A contains two medium yellow squares</span>. This indicates that within Block A, there are two medium yellow squares.<br><br>3. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Below medium yellow square number two is a medium black square</span>. This tells us that the medium black square is directly beneath medium yellow square number two.<br><br>4. <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">Below the medium black square is medium yellow square number one</span>. This means medium yellow square number one is at the bottom of this sequence in Block A.<br><br>5. <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">Block B contains a medium blue square</span>. This indicates that within Block B, there is a medium blue square.<br><br>6. <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block</span>. This suggests that there is a medium yellow square at the bottom edge of Block B.<br><br>7. <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">It is below the medium blue square</span>. This confirms that the medium yellow square in Block B is directly below the medium blue square.<br><br>Now, let's address the question: Which object is above a medium yellow square? The options are the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium yellow square number two.<br><br>- The object touching the bottom edge of Block B is a medium yellow square, which is below the medium blue square. Therefore, the medium blue square is above this medium yellow square.<br><br>- Medium yellow square number two is above the medium black square, which in turn is above medium yellow square number one. Therefore, medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.<br><br>Since both the medium blue square in Block B and medium yellow square number two in Block A are above a medium yellow square, the correct answer is {2}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>
