How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer_Reasoning: The opening bid is <fact5>$200</fact5>. Each of the <fact4>3 other people</fact4> bids once, so there are 3 bids of <fact3>$50</fact3> each, totaling 3 x $50 = $150. Carmen bids after each of these 3 bids, so she makes 3 bids of $50 each, totaling 3 x $50 = $150. Therefore, the total cost of the desk is the opening bid of $200 plus the $150 from Carmen's bids, which equals $200 + $150 = $350.

For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Steve loves playing video games</fact1>. <fact2>His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday</fact2>. <fact3>For the third year he buys 4 games a month</fact3> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money. <fact4>He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>. <fact5>He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year</fact5>, and then <fact6>the second year he starts buying 2 games a month</fact6>. How many games does Steve have after 3 years?

Answer_Reasoning: Initially, Steve receives <fact2>5 games for his birthday</fact2>. In the first year, he buys <fact5>1 game per month</fact5>, which totals 1 x 12 = 12 games. In the second year, he buys <fact6>2 games per month</fact6>, which totals 2 x 12 = 24 games. Additionally, he receives <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>, so he gets 5 games in the first year and 5 games in the second year, totaling 10 games. In the third year, he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3>, which totals 4 x 12 = 48 games, and he receives another 5 games for Christmas. Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 5 (initial) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 10 (Christmas in first and second year) + 48 (third year) + 5 (Christmas in third year) = 104 games.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Billy is <fact1>peeling and cutting potatoes</fact1> in preparation for <fact2>making potato salad</fact2> for his <fact3>big family reunion barbecue</fact3>. It's a big event, so he has <fact4>60 potatoes</fact4> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact5>a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact5>, but only about <fact6>5 seconds to cut it up</fact6>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer_Reasoning: Billy has <fact4>60 potatoes</fact4> to prepare. It takes him <fact5>a minute and a half</fact5> (which is 90 seconds) to peel each potato and <fact6>5 seconds</fact6> to cut each one. Therefore, the total time to prepare one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. For <fact4>60 potatoes</fact4>, the total time is 60 x 95 = 5700 seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60, resulting in 5700/60 = 95 minutes. Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>James gets 10 new CDs</fact1>. <fact2>He decides he doesn't like 5 of them</fact2> and <fact3>sells them for 40</fact3>. <fact4>Each CD cost $15</fact4>. <fact5>He gets them for 40% off</fact5>. How much money was he out?

Answer_Reasoning: James originally bought <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>. The original cost of each CD was <fact4>$15</fact4>, but he got them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>. Therefore, the discounted price per CD is $15 x (1 - 0.40) = $9. James spent 10 x $9 = $90 on the CDs. He sold <fact2>5 of them</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>. Therefore, he recouped $40 from the sale. The total money he was out is the amount he spent minus the amount he recouped: $90 - $40 = $50.

How many students were there in the school auditorium?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1>. <fact2>One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators</fact2>. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents</fact3> and <fact4>the rest were occupied by the students</fact4>. The school auditorium has <fact5>4 rows of seats</fact5>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium: <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1> x <fact5>4 rows</fact5> = 72 seats. Next, determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators: <fact2>One-fourth of the seats</fact2> = 72 / 4 = 18 seats. Subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total seats to find the remaining seats: 72 - 18 = 54 seats. Then, calculate how many of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents: <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats</fact3> = 54 / 3 = 18 seats. Finally, subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by the students: 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact3>three inches tall</fact3>. It takes <fact4>twelve glass chips</fact4> to make every square inch of the mosaic. <fact5>If he has two bags of glass chips</fact5>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer_Reasoning: Milo has <fact5>two bags of glass chips</fact5>, so he has 2 x <fact1>72 chips</fact1> = 144 chips. Each square inch of the mosaic requires <fact4>twelve glass chips</fact4>. Therefore, the total area Milo can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches. Since the mosaic is <fact3>three inches tall</fact3>, the length of the mosaic can be calculated by dividing the total area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches. Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

Answer_Reasoning: According to the information, Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The first dog needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second dog needs to walk <fact5>4 miles</fact5>, and the third dog needs to walk <fact6>3 miles</fact6>. The average distance they need to walk is <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first calculate the total miles needed for all dogs to meet the average: 4 dogs x 3 miles = 12 miles. The total miles already accounted for by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles to meet the average requirement.

Answer_Reasoning: The company sells <fact1>5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> and they have <fact3>4 vanilla scents</fact3> available, so they sell 5 x 4 = 20 vanilla scents. The company sells <fact2>2 of each of the fruity scents available</fact2> and they have <fact4>8 fruity scents available</fact4>, so they sell 2 x 8 = 16 fruity scents. The difference in sales between the vanilla and fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4. Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Answer_Reasoning: If Ron does not fix the pothole, he will incur <fact2>$450 worth of damage to his car</fact2>. If he fixes it himself, he will need to buy <fact3>3 buckets of asphalt</fact3> at <fact4>$25 each</fact4>, costing him 3 x $25 = $75. Additionally, he will be fined <fact6>$120 for unauthorized road maintenance</fact6>. Therefore, the total cost of fixing it himself is $75 + $120 = $195.

The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom. His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>. His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot to remove the old carpet</fact2>, and <fact3>$34 per square foot to install the new carpet</fact3>. The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>. How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the area of the bedroom using <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>, which is 18 x 12 = 216 square feet. The cost to remove the old carpet is 216 x <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> = $864. The cost to install the new carpet is 216 x <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> = $7,344. The cost of the new carpet itself is 216 x <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> = $2,592. The cost for the padding is 216 x <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5> = $432.

How many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer_Reasoning: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>. She gathers <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, which is 30/2 = 15 apples. Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees. Therefore, Joanne gathers a total of 30 + 15 + x apples.

Her sister gathers <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4>, which is 2 x 30 = 60 apples. She also gathers <fact5>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5>, which is 3 x 15 = 45 apples. According to <fact6>, she doesn't take any from the average trees. Therefore, her sister gathers a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

According to <fact7>, the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500. Simplifying this equation gives 150 + x = 500. Solving for x gives x = 500 - 150 = 350.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long</fact1>. <fact2>Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants</fact2>. <fact3>Pat already owns 17 flowers</fact3>. <fact4>Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide</fact4> so <fact5>she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant</fact5>. <fact6>Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store</fact6>. How much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer_Reasoning: First, convert the width of each flower from inches to feet: <fact4>12 inches</fact4> is 1 foot. The total space each plant occupies is the width of the plant plus the space between plants: 1 foot + <fact5>1.5 feet</fact5> = 2.5 feet per plant. To find out how many plants Pat needs, divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies: <fact1>111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4, which rounds up to 45 plants (since you can't have a fraction of a plant). Pat already owns <fact3>17 flowers</fact3>, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more plants. Each plant costs <fact6>$6</fact6>, so the total cost is 28 x $6 = $168.

He spends <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and <fact4>half that time swimming</fact4>. He also watched <fact5>3 different shows</fact5> which were <fact6>2 hours each</fact6>. How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total time spent on the events mentioned. John spends <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and <fact4>half that time swimming</fact4>, which is 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. He also watched <fact5>3 different shows</fact5> which were <fact6>2 hours each</fact6>, so he spent 3 x 2 = 6 hours watching shows. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours. Since this is <fact2>30% of the time</fact2>, the total time John spent on vacation is 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours. Therefore, the time he spent sightseeing is <fact1>40% of his time</fact1>, which is 50 x 0.40 = 20 hours.

If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer_Reasoning: The teacher starts with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1>. By the end of Monday, he has used <fact6>45%</fact6> of the chalk, which means he has 55% of the chalk left. 55% of 5 inches is 0.55 x 5 = 2.75 inches. According to <fact2>, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Therefore, he can use up to 0.75 inches more before recycling. If he uses <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, he uses 0.20 x 5 = 1 inch per day. Since he can use 0.75 inches more, he can use the chalk for 0.75/1 = 0.75 days. Since he cannot use a fraction of a day, he has 0 full days left before he has to recycle the chalk.

How much will it cost to fill the pool?

Answer_Reasoning: To find the volume of the pool, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = width x length x depth. So, the volume is <fact1>14 feet wide</fact1> x <fact2>25 feet long</fact2> x <fact3>4 feet deep</fact3> = 1,400 cubic feet. According to the pool company's instructions, we need to <fact5>multiply it by 5.9</fact5> to convert cubic feet to gallons. Therefore, 1,400 x 5.9 = 8,260 gallons of water are needed. The cost to fill the pool is <fact7>$0.10 per gallon</fact7>, so the total cost is 8,260 x $0.10 = $826.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Blake and Kelly are having a contest</fact1> to see <fact2>who can run the most in 15 minutes</fact2>. <fact3>They decide to do it on a football field</fact3> that is <fact4>100 yards long</fact4>. <fact5>Kelly runs back and forth once</fact5>, and then <fact6>decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake</fact6>, so <fact7>she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back</fact7>. <fact8>She does this 34 times</fact8>. <fact9>Blake runs back and forth 15 times</fact9>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the distance Kelly runs. Initially, she runs back and forth once on the full field, which is 2 x <fact4>100 yards</fact4> = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back <fact8>34 times</fact8>, which is 2 x 40 yards x 34 = 2720 yards. So, Kelly runs a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Next, calculate the distance Blake runs. He runs back and forth <fact9>15 times</fact9> on the full field, which is 2 x <fact4>100 yards</fact4> x 15 = 3000 yards.

Now, find the difference between the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards, and Kelly runs 2920 yards. Therefore, Blake runs 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards farther than Kelly.

How much will it cost to paint the room?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: A gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1> and cost <fact2>$12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with <fact3>four walls</fact3>. The north and south walls are <fact4>10 x 8 feet</fact4>. The east and west walls are <fact5>5 x 8 feet</fact5>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the area of the north and south walls. Each wall is <fact4>10 x 8 feet</fact4>, so the area of one wall is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet. Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls. Each wall is <fact5>5 x 8 feet</fact5>, so the area of one wall is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since a gallon of paint covers <fact1>20 square feet</fact1>, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. The cost for the paint is 12 gallons x <fact2>$12</fact2> per gallon = $144.

How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, <fact1>the kernels start popping faster</fact1>. <fact2>The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds</fact2>, but <fact3>in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds</fact3>. <fact4>Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking</fact4>, then <fact5>three times that amount in the next 30 seconds</fact5>. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, <fact6>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact6>. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?

Answer_Reasoning: In the first 30 seconds, <fact4>20 kernels pop</fact4>. In the next 30 seconds, <fact5>three times that amount</fact5> means 20 x 3 = 60 kernels pop. In the final 30 seconds, <fact3>the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds</fact3>, so 60 / 2 = 30 kernels pop. After taking the pan off the heat, <fact6>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds</fact6> also pop, which is 30 / 4 = 7.5, rounded to 8 kernels.

How much money is used?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate how long Jack can play. Since <fact5>they play for 4 hours</fact5>, Jack can play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. According to <fact2>, Jack uses 1 quarter for every 20 minutes, so he uses 240/20 = 12 quarters. 

Next, consider the two friends who are worse than Jack. According to <fact4>, they can only play half as long as Jack, so they play for 240/2 = 120 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 120/20 = 6 quarters. Since there are two friends, they use 6 x 2 = 12 quarters in total.

Finally, consider the friend who is better than Jack. According to <fact7>, this friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 x 1.5 = 360 minutes. This friend uses 360/20 = 18 quarters.

Adding up all the quarters used: Jack uses 12 quarters, the two worse friends use 12 quarters, and the better friend uses 18 quarters. In total, they use 12 + 12 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is 42 x $0.25 = $10.50.

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. First, calculate the number of movies that are in series:  
   A third of the movies are in series, so <fact5>1/3 of 600</fact5> = 200 movies are in series.

2. Calculate the cost of replacing the series movies:  
   The cost of replacing these series movies is <fact6>$6</fact6> each, so 200 x 6 = $1,200.

3. Calculate the number of movies that are not in series:  
   The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

4. Calculate the number of older movies:  
   <fact3>40% of the remaining movies</fact3> are older movies, so 0.4 x 400 = 160 older movies.

5. Calculate the cost of replacing the older movies:  
   The cost of replacing these older movies is <fact4>$5</fact4> each, so 160 x 5 = $800.

6. Calculate the number of normal movies:  
   The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

7. Calculate the cost of replacing the normal movies:  
   The cost of replacing these normal movies is <fact8>$10</fact8> each, so 240 x 10 = $2,400.

8. Calculate the total cost:  
   The total cost of replacing all the movies is $1,200 (series) + $800 (older) + $2,400 (normal) = $4,400.

Out of the <fact7>remaining class</fact7>, <fact8>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact8>. How many students are leaving early?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the number of football players. According to <fact6>, 20% of <fact5>30 students</fact5> are football players, which is 0.20 x 30 = 6 students. These students are leaving early. Next, determine the number of students remaining after accounting for the football players. According to <fact7>, the remaining class is 30 - 6 = 24 students. Out of these 24 students, <fact8>25% are cheerleaders or part of band</fact8>, which is 0.25 x 24 = 6 students. These students are also leaving early. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or part of band) = 12 students.

How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. On the first day, Wanda filled <fact4>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact4>, which is 18000 gallons x 1/4 = 4500 gallons.
2. Ms. B pumped <fact5>3/4 as much water as Wanda</fact5> on the first day, which is 4500 gallons x 3/4 = 3375 gallons.
3. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact7>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact7>, which is 4500 gallons x 2/3 = 3000 gallons.
4. Ms. B pumped <fact8>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact8>, which is 3375 gallons x 1/3 = 1125 gallons.
5. Total water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

He needs <fact1>2 implants</fact1>. Each implant has a <fact2>base price of $2000</fact2>. The crown costs an <fact3>extra $500</fact3>. For one of the implants, he wants a <fact4>crown made of porcelain</fact4>. He's already put down a <fact5>deposit of $600</fact5>. He makes <fact6>$15 per hour</fact6> at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Answer_Reasoning: George needs <fact1>2 implants</fact1>, and each implant has a <fact2>base price of $2000</fact2>. Therefore, the cost for the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. Each crown costs an <fact3>extra $500</fact3>, and since he wants a <fact4>crown made of porcelain</fact4> for one of the implants, the total cost for the crowns is 2 x $500 = $1000. The total cost for the dental work is $4000 + $1000 = $5000. George has already put down a <fact5>deposit of $600</fact5>, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $5000 - $600 = $4400. He makes <fact6>$15 per hour</fact6> at work, so he needs to work $4400 / $15 = 293.33 hours.

How much does he produce the fourth week?

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact7>, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. In the second week, as per <fact4>, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000/2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, according to <fact6>, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. According to <fact2>, Boris produces 50,000 bars each month.

Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could <fact4>charge their phones</fact4>. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was <fact5>losing 9% of the total capacity each hour</fact5>.

What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer_Reasoning: Initially, the power bank was losing <fact5>9% of the total capacity each hour</fact5>. This continued for <fact7>5 hours</fact7>, so the total loss during this period was 9% x 5 = 45%. After these 5 hours, the power bank had <fact6>28%</fact6> charge remaining.

Answer_Reasoning: Rose initially picks a total of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 flowers. She drops 1 of each type, so she loses 3 flowers, leaving her with 12 - 3 = 9 flowers. The petals on these remaining flowers are calculated as follows: 

- From <fact2>, she has 2 flowers with 5 petals each, contributing 2 x 5 = 10 petals.
- From <fact3>, she has 3 flowers with 6 petals each, contributing 3 x 6 = 18 petals.
- From <fact4>, she has 4 flowers with 4 petals each, contributing 4 x 4 = 16 petals.

Next, from <fact6>, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, but drops 1 as per <fact7>, leaving her with 5 flowers. These contribute 5 x 7 = 35 petals.

Adding all the petals together, we have 10 + 18 + 16 + 35 = 79 petals in total on the flowers in the vase.

If he also paid <fact5>$250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house</fact5>, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the transfer fees: <fact4>$400,000</fact4> x <fact2>3%</fact2> = $12,000. Next, calculate the brokerage fee: <fact4>$400,000</fact4> x <fact3>5%</fact3> = $20,000.

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Answer_Reasoning: Tobias howls for <fact7>20 seconds</fact7>. According to <fact4>, Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. According to <fact5>, Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. The total time for all three wolves howling is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60, resulting in 120/60 = 2 minutes.

Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Joe has $50</fact1> to buy an outfit for his new field trip. <fact2>The shirt he picks out has a price of $25</fact2>. <fact3>There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store</fact3>. <fact4>He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35</fact4>. <fact5>Assuming that sales tax is included</fact5>, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer_Reasoning: The shirt originally costs <fact2>$25</fact2>, but with a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3>, the discount is 0.30 x 25 = $7.50. Therefore, the sale price of the shirt is 25 - 7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost <fact4>$35</fact4>. The total cost for both items is 17.50 + 35 = $52.50. Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1>, so he cannot afford both items as the total exceeds his budget. However, if we assume he only buys what he can afford, he would only buy the shirt for $17.50. Therefore, Joe will have 50 - 17.50 = $32.50 left after purchasing just the shirt.

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?

Answer_Reasoning: On <fact1>Tuesday</fact1>, Clara bought <fact4>20 pomegranates</fact4> at <fact5>$20 each</fact5>. The total cost before the voucher was 20 x $20 = $400. With the <fact2>$2 off at the till</fact2>, Clara paid $400 - $2 = $398. On the <fact6>next day</fact6>, the price was <fact7>$30 per fruit</fact7>. Sheila bought <fact10>20 pomegranates</fact10>, so the total cost before the discount was 20 x $30 = $600.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact5>, each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so the total for the middle shelves is 2 x 10 = 20 books. From <fact3>, the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. From <fact4>, the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books. Therefore, one bookcase can hold 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books. From <fact6>, Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

According to the reformatted question, Sophie had <fact3>9 multicolored rings</fact3>, <fact4>31 building blocks</fact4>, and <fact5>8 stuffed animals</fact5>. Adding these together gives 9 + 31 + 8 = 48 toys. After buying the bouncy balls, the total number of toys became <fact7>62</fact7>. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 62 - 48 = 14.

How many calories is the omelet?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Eggs are 75 calories each</fact1>. <fact2>Cheese is 120 calories per ounce</fact2>. <fact3>Ham is 40 calories per ounce</fact3>. <fact4>John makes himself a 6 egg omelet</fact4> with <fact5>2 oz of cheese</fact5> and <fact6>an equal amount of ham</fact6>. How many calories is the omelet?

Answer_Reasoning: The omelet contains <fact4>6 eggs</fact4>, so it has 6 x <fact1>75 calories</fact1> = 450 calories from the eggs. It also contains <fact5>2 oz of cheese</fact5>, which adds 2 x <fact2>120 calories</fact2> = 240 calories from the cheese. Since the amount of ham is equal to the amount of cheese, there are <fact6>2 oz of ham</fact6>, contributing 2 x <fact3>40 calories</fact3> = 80 calories from the ham.

She <fact5>put both of these purchases on her credit card</fact5>. The <fact6>returned item cost $15.00</fact6>. What is the new balance on her credit card?

Answer_Reasoning: Sheila initially charged <fact1>$85.00</fact1> on her credit card. She returned an item costing <fact6>$15.00</fact6>, so the balance is reduced by $15.00, making it $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00. She then bought a frying pan with a 20% discount on <fact3>$20.00</fact3>, which is $20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00 off, so the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00. She also bought a set of towels with a 10% discount on <fact4>$30.00</fact4>, which is $30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00 off, so the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The <fact1>hotel is 20% more expensive than normal</fact1> because it is a busy weekend. The <fact2>normal price is $1500 per day</fact2>. The <fact3>plane tickets cost $5000 each</fact3>. If they are there for <fact4>3 days</fact4>, how much did the trip cost?

Answer_Reasoning: The hotel is <fact1>20% more expensive than normal</fact1>, so the increased price per day is <fact2>$1500</fact2> + (20% of <fact2>$1500</fact2>) = $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. For <fact4>3 days</fact4>, the hotel cost is $1800 x 3 = $5400. The plane tickets cost <fact3>$5000 each</fact3>, so for two people, the total cost is $5000 x 2 = $10000.

How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Answer_Reasoning: Mark edits <fact2>1000 sentences each week</fact2> and <fact5>edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers</fact5>. Therefore, he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays <fact3>5 cents per sentence</fact3>, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 x 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A. Publisher B pays <fact4>twice what Publisher A pays</fact4>, which is 5 x 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 x 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer_Reasoning: Morgan wants each person, including herself, to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. The total cost per person is calculated as follows:

- Mini-golf: <fact2>$5</fact2>
- Arcade tokens: <fact4>$5</fact4>
- Go-karts: 2 rides x <fact6>$10</fact6> = $20

The total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan has a budget of <fact1>$90</fact1>. To find out how many people (including Morgan) can participate, we divide the total budget by the cost per person: $90 / $30 = 3.

Since Morgan is one of the participants, she can invite 3 - 1 = 2 friends.

Answer_Reasoning: The brokerage fee is <fact3>5%</fact3> of the <fact2>selling price of $350,000</fact2>, which is $350,000 x 0.05 = $17,500.

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. Adam has collected <fact5>50 points</fact5>.
2. Betty collected <fact8>30% more</fact9> than Adam, so Betty collected 50 + (0.30 x 50) = 65 points.

How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Answer_Reasoning: Bob started with <fact6>7 fish in his pond</fact6>, consisting of <fact7>3 orange</fact7> and <fact8>4 white</fact8> fish. After buying <fact3>17 fish</fact3> from the store, he found that <fact5>he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact5>. Let W be the number of white fish he bought, and O be the number of orange fish he bought. We know that W + O = 17 (the total number of fish bought) and that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish after adding the new fish to the pond. Therefore, the equation becomes (3 + O) = 2(4 + W). Solving these equations:

1. W + O = 17
2. 3 + O = 2(4 + W)

From equation 2: 3 + O = 8 + 2W, which simplifies to O = 5 + 2W.

Substitute O = 5 + 2W into equation 1:

W + (5 + 2W) = 17
3W + 5 = 17
3W = 12
W = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: A toy manufacturer <fact1>receives an order for 400 toys</fact1>. <fact2>5 workers are available</fact2> to work on the order. They all <fact3>work on the order during their 10-hour shift</fact3>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer <fact4>still needs another 20 toys</fact4> to be able to ship the order. <fact5>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, and <fact6>another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer_Reasoning: The total number of toys needed is <fact1>400</fact1>. By the end of the shift, <fact4>20 toys</fact4> are still needed, so they produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys during the shift. The shift is <fact3>10 hours</fact3> long. 

The first 2 workers produce <fact5>6 toys an hour</fact5>, so together they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 12 x 10 = 120 toys.

The next 2 workers produce <fact6>4 toys an hour</fact6>, so together they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 8 x 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 380 - 200 = 180 toys over the 10-hour shift. Therefore, the fifth worker produces 180/10 = 18 toys per hour.

How far off was his guess?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Tim enters a competition</fact1> and <fact2>has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar</fact2>. <fact3>He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches</fact3>. <fact4>He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing</fact4>. <fact5>He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red</fact5>. <fact6>The jar has a square base</fact6> and <fact7>is 6 inches by 6 inches</fact7> and <fact8>15 inches tall</fact8>. <fact9>The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</fact9>. <fact10>How far off was his guess?</fact10>

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the volume of the jar using <fact6>the square base</fact6> and <fact7>dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches</fact7> and <fact8>15 inches tall</fact8>. The volume is 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches. Considering <fact4>80% efficiency in packing</fact4>, the effective volume for jelly beans is 540 x 0.8 = 432 cubic inches. Given <fact3>each jelly bean is .15 cubic inches</fact3>, the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans. According to <fact5>Tim's estimate that 30% of the jelly beans are red</fact5>, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 x 0.3 = 864. The true number of red jelly beans is <fact9>900</fact9>.

How long did the trip take?

Answer_Reasoning: The distance to the friend's house is <fact6>200 miles</fact6> plus the <fact3>10 miles detour</fact3>, totaling 210 miles. At a speed of <fact2>70 mph</fact2>, the time taken to reach the friend's house is 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact4>, the tattered jeans cost $28. From <fact5>, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. <fact8> states that he saved a total of $6. According to <fact9>, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6/3 = $2. Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24. The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $28 = -$4. However, this doesn't make sense as the jogger jeans should be cheaper. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28, so the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $22 = $6 less than the tattered jeans.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact5>, Frankie watched 1 hour on Monday and 1 hour on Tuesday, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, as per <fact8>, he watched 1.5 hours (1-hour episode + 30-minute show). On Friday, <fact11> states he watched 2 hours. Adding these, we have 2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5.5 hours. According to <fact12>, he watched 7 hours in total. Therefore, on Wednesday, he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, he watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes on Wednesday.

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If <fact1>the normal teacher comes in</fact1>, there's a <fact2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact2>. There's a <fact3>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher</fact3> who <fact4>won't collect the homework</fact4>. Even if <fact5>the whole class doesn't get an extension</fact5>, there's a <fact6>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment</fact6> and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer_Reasoning: To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he does not get an extension. 

1. If the normal teacher comes in (<fact1>), there is a 60% chance she will not give an extension (100% - <fact2>40% chance of extension</fact2>).
2. If there is a substitute teacher (<fact3>), there is a 50% chance the homework will not be collected (<fact4>).
3. If the normal teacher comes in and does not give an extension (<fact5>), there is an 80% chance Marcus cannot convince her to give a personal extension (100% - <fact6>20% chance of personal extension</fact6>).

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- Probability that the normal teacher comes in and Marcus has to turn in his homework: 60% (no class extension) * 80% (no personal extension) = 48%.
- Probability that a substitute teacher comes in and Marcus has to turn in his homework: 0% (since the substitute won't collect the homework).

Since these are mutually exclusive events, we add the probabilities:

- Total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework = 48% (normal teacher, no extension) + 0% (substitute teacher) = 48%.

How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer_Reasoning: Lorraine starts with <fact7>40 large stickers</fact7>. She trades <fact8>50%</fact8> of them, which is 40 x 0.5 = 20 large stickers, for large buttons. According to <fact2>, each large sticker is worth a large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade. She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. According to <fact3>, each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.

Lorraine also starts with <fact6>30 small stickers</fact6>. She trades <fact10>90%</fact10> of them, which is 30 x 0.9 = 27 small stickers, for large buttons. According to <fact5>, a large button is worth three small stickers, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons from this trade.

In total, Lorraine has 20 (from large stickers) + 9 (from small stickers) = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. Calculate the cost of the pins: <fact2>2 seniors will receive pins</fact2> at $5 each, so the cost for pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

2. Calculate the cost of the picture frames: <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> each receive a picture frame costing <fact3>$20</fact3>. The total cost for the frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

3. Calculate the additional cost for etching the frames: The etching cost is <fact4>20% of the frame cost</fact4>. So, the etching cost per frame is 20% of $20 = $4. The total etching cost is 44 x $4 = $176.

4. Calculate the cost of the cords: <fact5>1/4 of the seniors are officers</fact5>, so 44/4 = 11 officers. Each officer receives a cord costing <fact6>$12</fact6>, so the total cost for cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

5. Add all the costs together: $10 (pins) + $880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

Answer_Reasoning: Mike is currently a pen pal with <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact3>2</fact3> = 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends <fact4>2 letters a week</fact4>, and each letter is <fact5>5 pages long</fact5>. Therefore, Mike writes 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages a week. Since <fact1>Mike can write a page every 6 minutes</fact1>, he spends 30 x 6 = 180 minutes writing each week. Converting minutes to hours, 180 minutes is equal to 180/60 = 3 hours.

How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?

Answer_Reasoning: To determine the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar. According to <fact5>, each jar requires 2 pounds of passion fruit, which costs 2 x <fact1>$6</fact1> = $12. From <fact6>, each jar requires 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, which costs 1.5 x <fact2>$8</fact2> = $12. From <fact7>, each jar requires 2 pounds of honey, which costs 2 x <fact3>$10</fact3> = $20. Therefore, the total cost to make one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. 

According to <fact4>, each jar is sold for $50. Thus, the profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6. 

To find the total profit for selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 x 10 = $60.

The school as a whole is <fact5>50% boys</fact5> and <fact6>50% girls</fact6>. How many boys are in the third class?

Answer_Reasoning: The total number of students in the school is <fact1>3 classes</fact1> x <fact2>20 students</fact2> = 60 students. Since the school is <fact5>50% boys</fact5> and <fact6>50% girls</fact6>, there are 60 x 0.5 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school. The first class has <fact3>15 girls</fact3>, and the second class has <fact4>12 girls</fact4>, so together they have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. Therefore, the third class must have 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

How many slices of pizza were left?

Answer_Reasoning: There are <fact1>Bryce and four of his friends</fact1>, so there are 5 pizzas in total. Each pizza has <fact7>12 slices</fact7>, so there are 5 x 12 = 60 slices in total. <fact3>Bryce and two friends</fact3> ate <fact4>2/3 of their pizzas</fact4>. Since there are 3 people, they ate 3 x (2/3) = 2 pizzas. Therefore, they ate 2 x 12 = 24 slices. <fact5>The two remaining friends</fact5> ate <fact6>3/4 of their pizzas</fact6>. Since there are 2 people, they ate 2 x (3/4) = 1.5 pizzas. Therefore, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices. In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices. Therefore, there are 60 - 42 = 18 slices left.

How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?

Answer_Reasoning: The cost of renting the hanger for a year is <fact2>$5000</fact2> x 12 = $60,000. The cost of fuel per month is <fact2>$5000</fact2> x 2 = $10,000, so for a year, it is $10,000 x 12 = $120,000.

After buying the toys, <fact4>he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</fact4> so <fact5>he had to buy some more toys</fact5>. When James came back yet again, <fact6>3 dogs were gone</fact6> so <fact7>he no longer needed those toys</fact7>. <fact8>Each dog needs one toy</fact8>.

Answer_Reasoning: Initially, James has <fact2>4 dogs</fact2> and <fact1>4 toys</fact1>, so he is covered for those dogs. With <fact3>8 more dogs</fact3> arriving, he needs 8 additional toys, making it 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in total. After buying toys for these 12 dogs, <fact4>he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</fact4>, meaning there are now 12 x 2 = 24 dogs. He needs to buy additional toys for the new dogs, so he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

How many trees does he have left?

Answer_Reasoning: Tom starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2>. Over 10 years, he plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1>, so he plants 10 x 10 = 100 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees before any die or are chopped down is 50 + 100 = 150 trees. Over the 10 years, he chops down <fact4>2 trees a year</fact4>, so he chops down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. This leaves him with 150 - 20 = 130 trees. According to <fact3>, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. 30% of 130 trees is 0.30 x 130 = 39 trees.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of eggs hidden by Cole: <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Stacy finds <fact4>twice as many as Lamar</fact4>, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <fact5>2 less than Stacy</fact5>, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds <fact3>half as many as Charlie</fact3>, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. The total number of eggs found is 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since <fact1>each crayon weighs 1 ounce</fact1> and <fact3>Nik has 200 crayons</fact3>, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces. Next, determine how many boxes are needed. Since <fact4>he wants to separate them into groups of 8</fact4>, he will need 200/8 = 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is 25 x <fact7>8 ounces</fact7> = 200 ounces. The combined weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces. Finally, convert the total weight to pounds using <fact2>each pound is 16 ounces</fact2>.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. From <fact2>, we know that 11 students need size extra-small.
2. According to <fact5>, twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 x 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. From <fact1>, four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. According to <fact3>, half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. From <fact4>, six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Adding all these together, the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts.

Answer_Reasoning: Colby has already spent money on <fact2>5 movies on a Friday or Saturday</fact2> and <fact3>8 movies on other days</fact3>. The cost for these movies is 5 x <fact6>$10</fact6> + 8 x <fact7>$7</fact7> = $50 + $56 = $106.

Answer_Reasoning: Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \). According to <fact3>, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \). From <fact7>, the amount of salt is \( 2z \), and from <fact4>, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \). According to <fact6>, the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \). The total amount of all ingredients is \( z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z \). According to <fact5>, this total is 10 ounces. Therefore, \( 10z = 10 \), which means \( z = 1 \).

If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Artemis is potting flowers with her father</fact1>. <fact2>They buy a 30-pound bag of soil</fact2>. <fact3>Each rose needs 1 pound</fact3>. <fact4>Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds</fact4>. <fact5>Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds</fact5>. <fact6>If they plant 4 sunflowers</fact6> and <fact7>10 carnations</fact7>, how many roses can they plant?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers. They plant <fact6>4 sunflowers</fact6>, and each sunflower needs <fact4>3 pounds</fact4> of soil, so they use 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers. Next, calculate the soil used for the carnations. They plant <fact7>10 carnations</fact7>, and each carnation needs <fact5>1.5 pounds</fact5> of soil, so they use 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil for the carnations. The total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. They have a <fact2>30-pound bag of soil</fact2>, so the remaining soil is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds. Each rose needs <fact3>1 pound</fact3> of soil, so they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: A bus has a <fact1>capacity of 200 people</fact1>. On the <fact2>first stop</fact2>, <fact3>40 people entered the bus</fact3>. On the <fact4>second station</fact4>, <fact5>3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station</fact5> entered the bus. <fact6>Before its first stop</fact6>, it had <fact7>20 people</fact7>. If the <fact8>number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station</fact8>, calculate the <fact9>total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus</fact9>.

Answer_Reasoning: Initially, the bus had <fact7>20 people</fact7>. At the <fact2>first stop</fact2>, <fact3>40 people entered the bus</fact3>, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60. At the <fact4>second station</fact4>, <fact5>3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station</fact5> entered the bus, which is 3/4 x 40 = 30 people. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90. At the third station, the <fact8>number of passengers on the bus doubled</fact8>, so the total number of people became 90 x 2 = 180. The <fact1>capacity of the bus is 200 people</fact1>, so the <fact9>total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus</fact9> is 200 - 180 = 20.

How many total points did Sasha score during both games?

Answer_Reasoning: From the reformatted question, we know that Sasha scored <fact6>14 points</fact6> in the <fact4>first game</fact4>. According to <fact11>, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. According to <fact10>, Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Since <fact1>Sasha has leftover lumber</fact1>, <fact2>she decides to sell them</fact2>. <fact3>She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50%</fact3> in the last few months after <fact4>she bought some lumber</fact4>. <fact5>She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact5> that <fact6>cost her $10 each</fact6>. <fact7>She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact7> <fact8>she bought for $16 each</fact8>. If <fact9>she sells them all</fact9>, how much profit does she make?

Answer_Reasoning: Sasha has <fact5>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact5> that <fact6>cost her $10 each</fact6>. The total cost for these boards is 10 x $10 = $100. She also has <fact7>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact7> that <fact8>she bought for $16 each</fact8>. The total cost for these boards is 5 x $16 = $80. The total cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180. 

With the <fact3>prices for lumber having gone up 50%</fact3>, the selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 + (50% of $10) = $15. Therefore, the total selling price for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 x $15 = $150. The selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 + (50% of $16) = $24. Therefore, the total selling price for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 x $24 = $120. The total selling price for all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact1>, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. From <fact2>, half of them were Trekking bikes, so 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes were sold. From <fact3>, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so 300 x 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes were sold. According to <fact4>, the rest were MTB bikes, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes were sold. From <fact5>, the price of one MTB is $500, so Marcel earned 105 x $500 = $52,500 from MTB bikes.

He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</fact4> as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>?

Answer_Reasoning: A normal student has <fact1>6 periods</fact1> a day, and each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>. Therefore, a normal student spends 6 x 40 = 240 minutes in class per day. John takes <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>, so he spends an additional 2 x 40 = 80 minutes per day. Therefore, John spends 240 + 80 = 320 minutes in class per day. Over <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, John spends 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in class. John spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</fact4> as extra learning time. Therefore, he spends 1600/16 = 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday, totaling 200 minutes for the weekend. In total, John spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning per week.

What score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?

Answer_Reasoning: To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to calculate the total score required for an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are six tests and the lowest score is removed, the average is calculated over five tests. Therefore, the total score needed for an average of 93 is 93 x 5 = 465.

Brinley's current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71, which will be removed. The sum of the remaining scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To achieve a total of 465, Brinley needs a score on the sixth test such that 367 + sixth score = 465. Therefore, the sixth score needed is 465 - 367 = 98.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: A nurses' station <fact1>orders bandages in bulk packs of 50</fact1>. On the third day, <fact2>they ordered two bulk packs of bandages</fact2> and <fact3>only used half a pack</fact3>. On the second day, <fact4>they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day</fact4>. On the first day, <fact5>the nurses used 38 bandages</fact5> and <fact6>ordered one bulk pack of bandages</fact6>. They had <fact7>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</fact7>. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. On the first day, the nurses ordered <fact6>one bulk pack of bandages</fact6>, which is <fact1>50 bandages</fact1>, and used <fact5>38 bandages</fact5>. Therefore, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.

2. On the second day, they used <fact4>ten fewer bandages compared to the first day</fact4>, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

3. At the end of the second day, they had 12 (left from the first day) + 50 (ordered on the first day) - 28 (used on the second day) = 34 bandages left.

4. On the third day, they ordered <fact2>two bulk packs of bandages</fact2>, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages, and used <fact3>half a pack</fact3>, which is 50/2 = 25 bandages.

5. At the end of the third day, they had 34 (left from the second day) + 100 (ordered on the third day) - 25 (used on the third day) = 109 bandages.

6. According to <fact7>, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day must have been 109 - 78 = 31 bandages.

What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?

Answer_Reasoning: The base price of the truck is <fact1>$30,000</fact1>. The king cab upgrade costs an extra <fact8>$7,500</fact8>. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is <fact8>$7,500</fact8> / 3 = $2,500. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package costs <fact11>$1,500</fact11>. Adding these costs together, the total cost of the truck is <fact1>$30,000</fact1> + <fact8>$7,500</fact8> + $2,500 + $2,000 + <fact11>$1,500</fact11> = $43,500.

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest</fact1>. <fact2>Steve lives further away than Tim</fact2>, so <fact3>he is allowed to ride his bike</fact3>. <fact4>Tim lives 2 miles away from the school</fact4>. <fact5>Steve lives 3 miles from the school</fact5> and <fact6>can bike at 440 feet per minute</fact6>. If <fact7>Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</fact7>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer_Reasoning: First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile. Therefore, Tim's distance is <fact4>2 miles</fact4> x 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. Steve's distance is <fact5>3 miles</fact5> x 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet. 

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home. Tim's time is 10560 feet / <fact7>264 feet per minute</fact7> = 40 minutes. Steve's time is 15840 feet / <fact6>440 feet per minute</fact6> = 36 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. The time Steve will be waiting for Tim is 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

If <fact12>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact12>, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total straw used by the hamsters. Since there are <fact3>10 cages of hamsters</fact3> and <fact4>each hamster is kept alone</fact4>, there are 10 hamsters. Each hamster receives <fact5>5 pieces of straw</fact5>, so the total straw for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 pieces.

Next, calculate the straw used by the rabbits. According to <fact10>, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Now, calculate the straw used by the rats. The total straw distributed is <fact12>160 pieces</fact12>. Subtract the straw used by the hamsters and rabbits: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

The rats are <fact6>kept in 3 cages</fact6> and <fact7>in equal groups</fact7>. Each rat receives <fact8>6 pieces of straw</fact8>. Let x be the number of rats in each cage. Then, the total number of rats is 3x, and the total straw for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x. Set this equal to the straw used by the rats: 18x = 90. Solving for x gives x = 90 / 18 = 5.

What percent of the plants are flowering plants?

Answer_Reasoning: First, we need to determine how many plants are indoor plants. According to <fact5>, one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, so there are <fact1>100</fact1> x 1/4 = 25 indoor plants. This means there are <fact1>100</fact1> - 25 = 75 plants that are not indoor plants. According to <fact3>, two-thirds of the non-indoor plants are outdoor plants, so there are 75 x 2/3 = 50 outdoor plants. The remaining plants are flowering plants, so there are 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we calculate (25/<fact1>100</fact1>) x 100% = 25%.

In total, he <fact7>bought 3 packs</fact7> for <fact8>$1800 each</fact8>. How much money profit did he make?

After a month, <fact2>she collected three times that number</fact2>.

In the second month, <fact4>she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact4>. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?

Answer_Reasoning: In the first month, Elaine had <fact1>20 Pokemon cards</fact1>. In the second month, she collected <fact2>three times that number</fact2>, which is 3 x 20 = 60 cards. However, according to <fact4>, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she actually collected 20 - 20 = 0 cards in the second month. This seems to be a contradiction, so let's correct it: she collected 60 cards in the second month, not 0. In the third month, she collected <fact3>twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months</fact3>. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 20 + 60 = 80 cards. Therefore, in the third month, she collected 2 x 80 = 160 cards.

He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that <fact1>the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on</fact1>. <fact2>The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes</fact2>, and <fact3>this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes</fact3>. <fact4>The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station</fact4>, and <fact5>this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station</fact5>. <fact6>The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves</fact6>, and <fact7>this is the train Paul will board</fact7>. <fact8>The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact8>, and <fact9>this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives</fact9>. In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Answer_Reasoning: Paul needs to board the fourth train (<fact1>), and he will wait for the following sequence of events:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes (<fact2>) and stays for 20 minutes (<fact3>), so it leaves 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (<fact4>), which is 30 minutes after the first train leaves, totaling 60 minutes from the start. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (<fact5>), so it leaves 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves (<fact8>), which is 60 minutes after the second train leaves, totaling 125 minutes from the start. It leaves immediately after it arrives (<fact9>), so it leaves at 125 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (<fact6>), which is 20 minutes after the third train leaves, totaling 145 minutes from the start. This is the train Paul will board (<fact7>).

Therefore, Paul will wait a total of 145 minutes for his train.

They have <fact2>2 fewer green cars than they have red cars</fact2>. The rink also has <fact3>yellow cars</fact3>. They have <fact4>3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars</fact4>. If the rink has <fact5>75 cars in total</fact5>, how many yellow cars do they have?

Answer_Reasoning: The rink has <fact1>12 red cars</fact1>. According to <fact2>, they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. From <fact4>, they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars. Let the number of yellow cars be Y. The total number of cars is given by <fact5>75 cars in total</fact5>. Therefore, the equation is 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) + Y (yellow) = 75. Solving for Y gives Y = 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The <fact1>first venue charges a flat fee of $200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend. At the <fact2>second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price</fact2>. The <fact3>second venue charges $25 per person who attends</fact3>. However, the <fact4>first venue does not include food</fact4>, which Mark estimates will <fact5>cost $5 for each person who attends</fact5>. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer_Reasoning: To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the costs of each venue. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food per guest. This can be expressed as:
Total cost for the first venue = <fact1>$200</fact1> + <fact5>$5</fact5> * number of guests.

For the second venue, the total cost is simply the cost per person, as food is included:
Total cost for the second venue = <fact3>$25</fact3> * number of guests.

We set these two expressions equal to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:
200 + 5 * number of guests = 25 * number of guests.

Solving for the number of guests:
200 = 25 * number of guests - 5 * number of guests,
200 = 20 * number of guests,
number of guests = 200 / 20,
number of guests = 10.

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Reformatted_Question: Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the <fact1>third set</fact1>, he retrieved <fact2>half as many balls as in the second</fact2>. He retrieved <fact3>19 tennis balls in all</fact3>. In the <fact4>first of three sets</fact4>, he had to retrieve <fact5>four more balls than in the second set</fact5>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the <fact6>first set of the match</fact6>?

Answer_Reasoning: Let the number of balls retrieved in the second set be \( x \). According to <fact2>, in the third set, he retrieved \( x/2 \) balls. According to <fact5>, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls. The total number of balls retrieved is given by <fact3> as 19. Therefore, the equation is:

\[ x + (x + 4) + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combining terms, we have:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, he retrieved 6 balls. According to <fact5>, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \) balls.
