    <div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug such that the mixture of water from both mugs results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Mug 1: 4 ounces of water at 33 degrees.
   - Mug 2: 1 ounce of water at an unknown temperature, which we will call \( x \).

2. **Set up the equation for the final temperature:**
   - The final temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the formula for the weighted average of the temperatures:
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{(4 \text{ oz} \times 33^\circ) + (1 \text{ oz} \times x)}{4 \text{ oz} + 1 \text{ oz}}
   \]

3. **Substitute the known values and simplify:**
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5}
   \]
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{132 + x}{5}
   \]

4. **Set the final temperature to be at least 40 degrees:**
   \[
   \frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   132 + x \geq 200
   \]
   - Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x \geq 68
   \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To calculate how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to consider both the cost per mile and the monthly bonus he gives to his driver.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven per day:**
   - John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day.
   - Total miles per day = 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles driven per week:**
   - John works 5 days a week.
   - Total miles per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles.

3. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**
   - John works 50 weeks a year.
   - Total miles per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.

4. **Calculate the cost per mile driven:**
   - The driving service charges $2 per mile.
   - Total cost for miles driven per year = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

5. **Calculate the total bonus given per year:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\"  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract it from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Calculate the cost of the taffy:**
   - The deal is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Calculate the cost of the seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Calculate the cost of the magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

5. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Sally's parents gave her $10.
   - Remaining money = $10 - Total cost
   - Remaining money = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. How many dollars did she make that day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much Shawnda made on the first day, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - 5 people came by on bicycles.
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - Total bicycle tires = 5 people × 2 tires/person = 10 tires.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - 3 people came by on tricycles.
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - Total tricycle tires = 3 people × 3 tires/person = 9 tires.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - 1 person came by on a unicycle.
   - Each unicycle has 1 tire.
   - Total unicycle tires = 1 person × 1 tire/person = 1 tire.

4. **Total Tires:**
   - Total tires inflated = 10 (bicycle) + 9 (tricycle) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total earnings in cents = 20 tires × 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

6. **Convert to Dollars:**

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations to find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

2. **Apples Gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: Half of 30, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: \( x \) apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
   \[
   30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
   \]

3. **Apples Gathered by Joanne's Sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: Twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: Three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
   \[
   60 + 45 = 105
   \]

4. **Total Apples Gathered by Both Sisters:**
   - The problem states that together they gather 500 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (45 + x) + 105 = 500
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   - Subtract 150 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. A round of mini-golf is $5. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person for the activities and then see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

1. **Cost Breakdown per Person:**
   - Mini-golf: $5
   - Arcade tokens: $5
   - Go-karts: $10 per ride, and each person rides twice, so $10 x 2 = $20

2. **Total Cost per Person:**
   - Total cost = Mini-golf + Arcade tokens + Go-karts
   - Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

3. **Determine the Number of People:**
   - Morgan has a total budget of $90.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of people (including Morgan) who can participate.
   - The total cost for \( x \) people is \( 30x \).
   - We set up the inequality: \( 30x \leq 90 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 30: \( x \leq \frac{90}{30} \)
   - \( x \leq 3 \)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Morgan can invite 2 friends, as she is also included in the count of 3 people.

After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Cups and Rows**: Lana has a total of 27 cups, which she divides into 3 rows. This means each row has:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

2. **Cups of Cinnamon Tea**: Lana uses some of these cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is:
   \[
   27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Distribution of Chamomile and Mint Tea**: These 12 cups are divided equally among the 3 rows. Therefore, each row has:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups of chamomile and mint tea}
   \]

4. **Equal Amounts of Chamomile and Mint Tea**: Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we can denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, for each row:
   \[
   x + x = 4

1. **Calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display:**
   - The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
   - Total city fireworks = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

2. **Determine how many of the city's fireworks Hannah can see:**
   - Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
   - Fireworks Hannah can see from the city = 40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

3. **Calculate the total number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard display:**
   - Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
   - Total backyard fireworks = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

4. **Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:**
   - Total fireworks Hannah will see = Fireworks from the city she can see + Fireworks from her backyard
   - Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in class during the weekdays and the additional time he spends on the weekend.

1. **Calculate the total class time per day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods a day, with each class lasting 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total class time per day is:
     \[
     6 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 240 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total class time per week for a normal student:**
   - The student attends classes 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total class time per week is:
     \[
     240 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1200 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the additional class time for John:**
   - John takes 2 extra classes a day, each lasting 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, the additional class time per day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ extra classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 80 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total additional class time per week for John:**
   - John attends these extra classes 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total additional class time per week is:
     \[
     80 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 400 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total class time per week for John:**
   - Add the normal class time and the additional class time:
     \[
     1200 \text{ minutes/week} + 400 \text{ minutes/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

6. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the total extra learning time on the weekend is:
     \[
     2 \times \left(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes}\right) = 2 \times 100 \text{ minutes} = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total learning time per week for John:**
   - Add the total class time and the extra learning time:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

8. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours}
     \]

And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of payment separately and then sum them up.

1. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check every month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 checks for the gas bill.

2. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly for this service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for the pest and lawn service.

3. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check every month for the electric bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.

4. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. Therefore, in one month, he writes 2 checks, and over 12 months, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks for the church.

Now, we add up all the checks:

- Gas Bill: 12 checks
- Pest and Lawn Service: 4 checks
- Electric Bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 4 + 12 + 24 = 52\).

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each person finds and then subtract the total from the number of eggs Cole initially hid.

1. **Initial number of eggs:**
   - Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 3 dozen eggs is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Eggs found by each person:**
   - **Lamar:** Finds 5 eggs.
   - **Stacy:** Finds twice as many as Lamar. Therefore, Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.
   - **Charlie:** Finds 2 less than Stacy. Therefore, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
   - **Mei:** Finds half as many as Charlie. Therefore, Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

3. **Total eggs found:**
   - Add up the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
     \[
     5 \, (\text{Lamar}) + 10 \, (\text{Stacy}) + 8 \, (\text{Charlie}) + 4 \, (\text{Mei}) = 27 \, \text{eggs}
     \]

4. **Eggs still hidden:**
   - Subtract the total eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
     \[
     36 \, (\text{initial eggs}) - 27 \, (\text{eggs found}) = 9 \, \text{eggs}

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to consider each meal separately and then sum up the slices.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so he made 7 sandwiches.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

2. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinner:**
   - Carl made a dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

3. **Cheese and Egg Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:

- Total slices for sandwiches = 14 slices

At the start of the game, Maria had one water balloon for herself. Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.  At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Maria starts with 1 water balloon.

2. **Balloons from Maria's Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gives each of the 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons.
   - Total balloons given by Maria's mom = 5 people × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons.

3. **Total Balloons After Mom's Contribution:**
   - Maria's initial balloon + balloons from her mom = 1 + 3 = 4 balloons for Maria.
   - Each of her 4 friends also receives 3 balloons from Maria's mom.

4. **Balloons Given by Maria:**
   - Maria gives each of her 4 friends 2 balloons.
   - Total balloons given by Maria = 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons.

5. **Maria's Balloons After Giving:**
   - Maria initially had 4 balloons (1 initial + 3 from her mom).
   - After giving away 8 balloons, Maria has 4 - 8 = -4 balloons, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate:
   - Maria had 4 balloons after her mom's contribution, but she can't give away more than she has. So, she gives away 2 balloons to each friend from the 3 she received, leaving her with 1 balloon.

6. **Final Count of Balloons:**
   - Maria has 1 balloon left.
   - Each of her 4 friends received 3 balloons from Maria's mom and 2 from Maria, totaling 5 balloons each.

7. **Total Balloons Among All:**
   - Maria has 1 balloon.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the journey.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - The total distance across the lake is 20 miles.
   - James swims 60% of this distance initially.
   - Distance swum initially = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = 0.5 * 6 hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum = 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

5. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   - After resting, James swims at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour (since half of 2 miles per hour is 1 mile per hour).
   - Time taken to swim 8 miles = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

6. **Calculate the total time taken to get across the lake:**
   - Total time = Time for initial swim + Rest time + Time for remaining swim
   - Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried and then find the total number of balls.

1. **Identify the number of balls each boy carried:**
   - Let the number of balls Jason carried be \( J \).
   - According to the problem, Jason carried 2 balls. So, \( J = 2 \).

2. **Determine the number of balls Jordan carried:**
   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.
   - Therefore, the number of balls Jordan carried is \( 2 \times J = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

3. **Determine the number of balls Jeffrey carried:**
   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.
   - Let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( x \).
   - Therefore, \( J = 2x \).
   - Since \( J = 2 \), we have \( 2 = 2x \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 1 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of balls:**
   - Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
   - Jason carried 2 balls.
   - Jordan carried 4 balls.

The normal price is $1500 per day. The plane tickets cost $5000 each. If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider both the hotel and the plane tickets.

1. **Calculate the hotel cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal due to it being a busy weekend.
   - To find the increased price, calculate 20% of $1500:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1500 = 300
     \]
   - Add this increase to the normal price to find the new price per day:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

2. **Calculate the plane ticket cost:**
   - The plane tickets cost $5000 each.
   - Since there are two people (Tom and his wife), the total cost for the plane tickets is:

Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference between these times.

1. **Convert distances to feet:**
   - Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Tim's distance in feet is:
     \[
     2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Steve lives 3 miles away from the school. His distance in feet is:
     \[
     3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:**
   - Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. The time it takes for Tim to get home is:
     \[
     \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. The time it takes for Steve to get home is:
     \[
     \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine who gets home first and calculate the waiting time:**
   - Steve takes 36 minutes, and Tim takes 40 minutes. Therefore, Steve gets home first.
   - The difference in time is:
     \[
     40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost per dress pant = $750/5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants × $150/dress pant = $1,500.

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 × 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.

After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. The friend's house is 200 miles away. How long did the trip take?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. **Trip to the friend's house:**
   - The original distance to the friend's house is 200 miles.
   - The detour adds 10 miles, making the total distance to the friend's house 210 miles.
   - John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

   The time taken for this part of the trip is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Trip back home:**
   - The distance for the return trip is 240 miles.
   - John drives at a speed of 80 mph.

   The time taken for the return trip is:
   \[
   \text{Time back home} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Total trip time:**

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately and then compare them.

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires.
- The charge for each car tire is $40.
- Total revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 tires * $40/tire = $480.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- The charge for each truck tire is $60.
- The charge for each car tire is $40.
- Total revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 tires * $60/tire = $360.
- Total revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 tires * $40/tire = $160.
- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 (truck tires) + $160 (car tires) = $520.

Now, we compare the revenues:
- Revenue on Friday = $480.
- Revenue on Thursday = $520.

The day with higher revenue is Thursday. To find out how much more revenue was earned on Thursday compared to Friday, we subtract the revenue of Friday from the revenue of Thursday:

$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.

A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to carefully track Lorraine's trades and conversions of stickers to buttons.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Large Stickers:**
   - Each large sticker is worth either 1 large button or 3 small buttons.
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
     - 50% of 40 large stickers = 20 large stickers.
     - These 20 large stickers are traded for 20 large buttons.
   - She trades the remaining 50% of her large stickers for small buttons:
     - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for 3 small buttons each.
     - 20 large stickers × 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons.

3. **Trading Small Stickers:**
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button.
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
     - 90% of 30 small stickers = 27 small stickers.
     - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small stickers can be traded for 9 large buttons (since 27 ÷ 3 = 9).

4. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 9 large buttons.
   - Total large buttons = 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60 small buttons.
   - Lorraine does not trade any small stickers for small buttons directly, as they were used to trade for large buttons.

5. **Final Inventory:**
   - Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans before the sale:**
   - Tattered jeans: $28
   - Jogger jeans: $22
   - Total cost before the sale: \(28 + 22 = 50\) dollars.

3. **Understand the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on the purchase.
   - He saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Total savings: $6
   - Savings from jogger jeans: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) dollars.
   - Savings from tattered jeans: \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

5. **Determine the original cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The jogger jeans were originally priced at $22 before the savings.
   - Since Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price was \(22 + 2 = 24\) dollars.

6. **Compare the original cost of the jogger jeans to the tattered jeans:**
   - Original cost of jogger jeans: $24

They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table.  They also have 10 boxes of stuff already.  If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes donated:**
   - 10 people donate 5 boxes each.
   - Total boxes from donations = 10 people × 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

2. **Add the boxes they already have:**
   - They already have 10 boxes.
   - Total boxes = 50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already have) = 60 boxes.

3. **Determine how many boxes can fit on the existing tables:**
   - Each table can hold 2 boxes.
   - They have 15 tables.
   - Total boxes that can fit on existing tables = 15 tables × 2 boxes/table = 30 boxes.

4. **Calculate the number of boxes that still need tables:**
   - Total boxes = 60 boxes.
   - Boxes that can fit on existing tables = 30 boxes.
   - Boxes that still need tables = 60 boxes - 30 boxes = 30 boxes.

5. **Determine how many additional tables are needed:**
   - Each new table can hold 2 boxes.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and how much more money she needs to earn.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:**
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs.
   - Total cost for the shoes = 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40.
   - Total cost for the jacket and shoes = $30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70.

2. **Calculate how much money Sara already has:**
   - Sara had $10 saved initially.
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting = 4 times × $5/time = $20.
   - Total money Sara has = $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

3. **Determine how much more money Sara needs:**
   - Total cost of jacket and shoes = $70.
   - Total money Sara has = $30.
   - Additional money needed = $70 - $30 = $40.

4. **Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn:**
   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
   - To earn $40, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn = $40 ÷ $4/time = 10 times.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda from the remaining cans.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Total sodas: 12
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: 9 (since 12 - 3 = 9)

2. **Sodas taken by Ellen's brother:**
   - Shaken sodas taken: 1
   - Unshaken sodas taken: 2

   After Ellen's brother takes the sodas:
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 9 - 2 = 7

3. **Soda taken by Ellen:**
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda.

   After Ellen takes her soda:
   - Remaining shaken sodas: 2 (no change)
   - Remaining unshaken sodas: 7 - 1 = 6

4. **Total remaining sodas:**
   - Total remaining sodas = 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8

5. **Probability calculation:**
   - Probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda = (Number of remaining shaken sodas) / (Total remaining sodas)

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The piece of chalk is initially 5 inches long.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

3. **Chalk Usage per Day**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each subsequent day.
   - 20% of the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

4. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling**:
   - The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - Current chalk length = 2.75 inches.
   - Chalk needs to be reduced to less than 2 inches, so the chalk can be used until it is just above 2 inches.

5. **Calculate the Number of Days**:
   - Remaining chalk before recycling = 2.75 inches - 2 inches = 0.75 inches.
   - Number of days the teacher can use the chalk = 0.75 inches / 0.55 inches per day ≈ 1.36 days.

Since the teacher can only use the chalk for whole days, he can use it for 1 full day before it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate both her total cost and her total revenue from selling the boards at the increased price.

1. **Calculate the original cost of the lumber:**

   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{Cost} = 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
     \]

   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{Cost} = 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
     \]

   - Total original cost:
     \[
     \$100 + \$80 = \$180
     \]

2. **Calculate the selling price of the lumber after a 50% price increase:**

   - The price increase is 50%, so the new price is 150% of the original price.

   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{New price per board} = \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
     \]

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{New price per board} = \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
     \]

   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \$150 + \$120 = \$270
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**

   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total original cost.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rats are in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed.

1. **Calculate the straw used by the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages × 5 pieces of straw per cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the straw used by the rabbits:**
   - The rabbits collectively receive 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used by the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used by rats = Total straw - Straw for hamsters - Straw for rabbits
   - Straw used by rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total number of rats = 3 cages × \( x \) rats per cage = \( 3x \).
   - Total straw for rats = \( 3x \) rats × 6 pieces of straw per rat = 18x pieces of straw.
   - We know from step 3 that the total straw for rats is 90 pieces.
   - Therefore, 18x = 90.

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 18 to find \( x \).
   - \( x = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \).

Thus, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost of each venue and find the point at which they are equal.

1. **First Venue:**
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Additional cost per guest for food: $5
   - Total cost for the first venue with \( x \) guests: 
     \[
     \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Second Venue:**
   - Cost per guest (including food): $25
   - Total cost for the second venue with \( x \) guests:
     \[
     \text{Cost}_2 = 25x
     \]

3. **Set the costs equal to find the number of guests where the costs are the same:**
   \[
   200 + 5x = 25x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 25x - 5x
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of lemons needed for the initial 4 gallons of lemonade:**
   - Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Tim plans to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice for the 4 gallons.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 4 cups of juice, Tim will need:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart:**
   - The extra gallon for Allen needs to be twice as tart, meaning it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Normally, 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, so twice as tart means 2 cups of lemon juice for this extra gallon.
   - For 2 cups of juice, Tim will need:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed:**
   - Add the lemons needed for the initial 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
     \[
     24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\{36\}\).</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span class='correct'>36</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 36</div></div>

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**

   The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]

   Given:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   Plug these values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

   According to the pool company, multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to convert it to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

   The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost is:

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the first race, he lost $5. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the amounts Johnny's dad won and lost in each race and then calculate the average loss for the day.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount lost in the first race was $5.
   - Twice the amount lost is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Therefore, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race.
   - Therefore, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total loss and the average loss:

- **Total Loss:**
  - First race loss: $5
  - Second race: He won $11, so no loss here.
  - Third race loss: $16.5

  Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

- **Average Loss:**
  - There are three races in total.
  - Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $21.5 / 3 = $7.1667

Therefore, the average loss Johnny's dad experienced that day is approximately $7.1667.

In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the number of guests in the hotel after dinner, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Guests:**  
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkouts:**  
   24 guests elected an early checkout.  
   So, the number of guests after early checkouts = 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

3. **Late Checkouts:**  
   15 guests elected a late checkout.  
   So, the number of guests after late checkouts = 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

4. **Check-ins After Dinner:**  
   7 more people checked in after dinner.  
   So, the number of guests after these check-ins = 61 + 7 = 68 guests.

5. **Afternoon Check-ins:**  
   In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  
   Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 2 * 15 = 30 guests.

He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the loan amount:**  
   John gets a loan worth 40% of his house's value.  
   The value of his house is $250,000.  
   So, the loan amount is 40% of $250,000.  
   \[
   \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount used to pay off debts:**  
   John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts.  
   So, the amount used to pay debts is 60% of $100,000.  
   \[
   \text{Amount used for debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the leftover amount:**  
   To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts, we subtract the amount used for debts from the total loan amount.

Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, taking into account the trees he plants, the trees that die, and the trees he chops down.

1. **Initial number of trees:** Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Trees planted over 10 years:** Tom plants 10 trees each year. Over 10 years, he plants:
   \[
   10 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 100 \text{ trees}
   \]

3. **Total trees before any die or are chopped down:** 
   \[
   50 \text{ initial trees} + 100 \text{ planted trees} = 150 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees chopped down over 10 years:** Tom chops down 2 trees each year. Over 10 years, he chops down:
   \[
   2 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 20 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Total trees after chopping down:** 
   \[
   150 \text{ trees} - 20 \text{ chopped trees} = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

6. **Trees that die after 10 years:** 30% of the trees die. Calculate 30% of 130 trees:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

7. **Final number of trees after accounting for deaths:**
   \[
   130 \text{ trees} - 39 \text{ dead trees} = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is \(\{91\}\).

In the first year, they will build 12 homes. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, let's break down the construction plan year by year:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year.
   - Homes built in the second year = 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

3. **Third Year:**
   - By the end of the third year, the town will count the total number of homes built so far and double that amount.
   - Total homes built by the end of the second year = 12 (first year) + 36 (second year) = 48 homes.
   - In the third year, they will double this amount: 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three years:

They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Toys Needed:** The order is for 400 toys.

2. **Toys Remaining After Shift:** By the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means that 400 - 20 = 380 toys have been produced during the shift.

3. **Workers and Their Production Rates:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - 1 worker's production rate is unknown (let's call it \( x \) toys per hour).

4. **Calculate Total Toys Produced by Known Workers:**
   - The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour each will produce:
     \[
     2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour each will produce:
     \[
     2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Total Toys Produced by Known Workers:**
   \[
   120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

6. **Calculate Toys Produced by the Fifth Worker:**
   - Since a total of 380 toys were produced, and the known workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
     \[
     380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

7. **Determine the Fifth Worker's Production Rate:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so their production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bandages ordered each day:**
   - On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs, which is 2 × 50 = 100 bandages.

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used each day:**
   - On the first day, they used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - On the third day, they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

3. **Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:**
   - Total used = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.

4. **Determine the total number of bandages ordered over the three days:**

5. **Calculate the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

6. **Set up the equation to find the initial number of bandages:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - The equation is: 
     \[
     x + \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total used} = \text{Bandages left}
     \]
   - Plug in the known values:
     \[
     x + 150 - 91 = 78
     \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x + 59 = 78
     \]
   - Subtract 59 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 78 - 59
     \]
   - Calculate:

In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total Bikes Sold:**
   - Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.

2. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = 300 / 2 = 150.

3. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45.

4. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

5. **Prices:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Price of one BMX bike = half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250.
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.

6. **Total Earnings:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of one MTB = 105 * $500 = $52,500.
   - Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250.
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of one Trekking = 150 * $450 = $67,500.

7. **Total Earnings from All Bikes:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, but only a third of them are his lines. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines he has in each part of his role: the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Since it's a solo, all 54 lines are Sean's.

2. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Number of lines in the second scene = 54 (lines in the song) + 6 = 60 lines.
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's.
   - Number of lines Sean has in the second scene = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

3. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene = 2 \times 54 = 108 lines.
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's.
   - Number of lines Sean has in the first scene = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Lines from the solo song: 54
- Lines from the second scene: 48
- Lines from the first scene: 36

Total lines Sean has to memorize = 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines.

The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2. How much did everything cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee and the donut.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
   - The normal brand costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, calculate 20% of $5:
     \[
     0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Add this to the original price to find the cost per pound of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     7 \times 6 = 42
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the costs of not fixing it versus fixing it himself.

1. **Cost of not fixing the pothole:**
   - If Ron does not fix the pothole, it will cause $450 worth of damage to his car.

2. **Cost of fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. Therefore, the cost of asphalt is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is:
     \[
     75 + 120 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of not fixing it and the cost of fixing it himself:
     \[
     450 - 195 = 255 \text{ dollars}

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's first determine how many books each shelf can hold.

1. **Middle Shelves:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves.
   - Total books on middle shelves = 2 shelves × 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

2. **Bottom Shelf:**
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - A middle shelf holds 10 books, so the bottom shelf can hold 2 × 10 = 20 books.

3. **Top Shelf:**
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - The bottom shelf holds 20 books, so the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

4. **Total Books per Bookcase:**
   - Total books a single bookcase can hold = books on top shelf + books on bottom shelf + books on middle shelves
   - Total = 15 (top) + 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) = 55 books.

5. **Determine Number of Bookcases Needed:**

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each muffaletta sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs:
     - Meat: \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \)
     - Cheese: \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \)

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**

Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to calculate how many additional plants she needs to buy.

1. **Convert the flower bed length to inches:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the flower bed is \(111 \times 12 = 1332\) inches long.

2. **Calculate the space required for each plant:**
   - Each plant is 12 inches wide.
   - Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Convert 1.5 feet to inches: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) inches.
   - Therefore, the total space required for each plant, including the gap, is \(12 + 18 = 30\) inches.

3. **Determine the number of plants needed:**
   - Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant: \(\frac{1332}{30} \approx 44.4\).
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she needs 45 plants to fill the flower bed.

4. **Calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - Therefore, she needs to buy \(45 - 17 = 28\) additional plants.

The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. The first friend says 80. What is their average guess?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to determine each friend's guess based on the information provided and then calculate the average.

1. **First Friend's Guess:**
   - The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

2. **Third Friend's Guess:**
   - The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend.
   - 25% of 80 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.25 \times 80 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the third friend's guess is:
     \[
     80 + 20 = 100
     \]

3. **Second Friend's Guess:**
   - The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - Half of the first friend's guess is:
     \[
     \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]
   - Adding 20 to this gives the second friend's guess:
     \[
     40 + 20 = 60
     \]

4. **Calculate the Average Guess:**
   - We have the guesses: 80 (first friend), 60 (second friend), and 100 (third friend).
   - The sum of these guesses is:
     \[
     80 + 60 + 100 = 240
     \]
   - The average guess is calculated by dividing the total sum by the number of friends (3):

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. On the seventh day, he wasn't traveling at all. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we need to break down the trip into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = 4 days × 200 km/day = 800 km.

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Tom traveled a total of 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = 0.30 × 800 km = 240 km.

3. **Seventh Day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all on the seventh day, so the distance is 0 km.

4. **Second Week (7 Days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 7 days × 300 km/day = 2100 km.

5. **Total Distance for the Two-Week Trip:**
   - Add up all the distances from each part of the trip:
   - Total distance = 800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 0 km (seventh day) + 2100 km (second week)
   - Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, given that he watched a total of 7 hours of TV throughout the week.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Monday and Tuesday:** Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

2. **Thursday:** Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday = 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours

3. **Friday:** Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Total hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 2 hours (Mon & Tue) + 1.5 hours (Thu) + 2 hours (Fri) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the hours watched on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:

- Total hours on Wednesday = Total hours for the week - Total hours from other days
- Total hours on Wednesday = 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode of the show on Wednesday is 30 minutes long, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes fit into 1.5 hours:

- 1.5 hours = 1.5 * 60 minutes = 90 minutes
- Number of 30-minute episodes = 90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The next day they sold double that number of shoes. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tennis shoes sold each day and then sum them up.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - On Saturday, the store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - On the last day of the sale (Sunday), the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park. Let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Initial Information:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour while charging her friends' phones.
   - After some time, the charge remaining is 28%.

2. **First Phase of Discharge:**
   - The power bank loses 9% per hour for 5 hours.
   - Total loss in this phase = 9% * 5 = 45%.

3. **Charge after First Phase:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial charge when Maria went to the park.
   - After losing 45% of its charge, the remaining charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, \( x - 45\% \text{ of } x = 28\% \).
   - This can be written as: \( x - 0.45x = 0.28 \).
   - Simplifying, we get: \( 0.55x = 0.28 \).

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{0.28}{0.55} \).
   - \( x \approx 0.5091 \) or 50.91%.

5. **Verification with Second Phase:**
   - After the first phase, the charge is 28%.
   - In the second phase, the power bank loses 7% per hour for 3 hours.
   - Total loss in this phase = 7% * 3 = 21%.
   - Remaining charge after second phase = 28% - 21% = 7%.

The calculations are consistent with the problem statement, confirming that the initial charge when Maria went to the park was approximately 50.91%.

Six more students need size extra-large than large. Twice as many students need size small as extra small.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of shirts needed for each size and then sum them up.

1. **Extra-Small (XS):**  
   We know that 11 students need size extra-small shirts.  
   \[
   \text{XS} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S):**  
   Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.  
   \[
   \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M):**  
   Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  
   \[
   \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles.**

- There are 8 rooms in the house.
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.

First, calculate the number of rooms with small candles:
\[ \text{Number of rooms with small candles} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Then, calculate the total number of small candles:
\[ \text{Total small candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles} \]

Next, calculate the number of rooms with medium candles:
\[ \text{Number of rooms with medium candles} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Then, calculate the total number of medium candles:
\[ \text{Total medium candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

Add the small and medium candles together to find the total number of candles:
\[ \text{Total candles} = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of flashlights.**

- There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight.
- There are 2 flashlights for each room.

First, calculate the total number of flashlights for the people:
\[ \text{Flashlights for people} = 4 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ flashlight per person} = 4 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, calculate the total number of flashlights for the rooms:
\[ \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights per room} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Add the flashlights for people and rooms together to find the total number of flashlights:
\[ \text{Total flashlights} = 4 \text{ flashlights for people} + 16 \text{ flashlights for rooms} = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of candles and flashlights combined.**

Add the total number of candles and flashlights:
\[ \text{Total candles and flashlights} = 36 \text{ candles} + 20 \text{ flashlights} = 56 \]

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time each wolf howls and then find the combined length of time for all three wolves.

1. **Determine Tobias's Howling Time:**
   - Tobias howls for a certain number of times, and each howl lasts 20 seconds. Let's denote the number of howls Tobias makes as \( x \).
   - Therefore, Tobias's total howling time is \( 20x \) seconds.

2. **Determine Chikote's Howling Time:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's total howling time is \( 2 \times 20x = 40x \) seconds.

3. **Determine Igneous's Howling Time:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined howling time of Tobias and Chikote is \( 20x + 40x = 60x \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's total howling time is also \( 60x \) seconds.

4. **Calculate the Total Howling Time for All Three Wolves:**
   - The total howling time for all three wolves is the sum of their individual howling times:
   \[
   20x + 40x + 60x = 120x \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert the Total Howling Time to Minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{120x}{60} = 2x \text{ minutes}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of howls \( x \), the final answer is expressed in terms of \( x \).

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then determine how much more is needed to fill the tank.

**Day 1:**
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so Wanda pumped:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did on the first day. Therefore, Ms. B pumped:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Total water pumped on Day 1:**
\[
4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Day 2:**
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, Wanda pumped:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, Ms. B pumped:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Total water pumped on Day 2:**
\[
3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Total water pumped over the two days:**
\[
7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Remaining water needed to fill the tank:**
The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons, so the remaining amount of water needed is:
\[
18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

A company had sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received, we need to determine the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date and then calculate the cost of that milk.

1. **Determine the amount of expired milk:**
   - Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk he purchased had expired.
   - He purchased a total of 4000 gallons of milk.
   - To find the amount of expired milk, multiply the total gallons by the fraction that expired:
     \[
     \text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the expired milk:**
   - The cost per gallon of milk is $3.5.
   - To find the total cost of the expired milk, multiply the number of expired gallons by the cost per gallon:
     \[
     \text{Cost of expired milk} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the refund amount:**
   - Since Mr. Marcellus returned the expired milk and requested a refund, the refund amount is equal to the cost of the expired milk, which is $5600.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to break down the movie collection into different categories and calculate the cost for each category.

1. **Total Movies**: Mike has a total of 600 movies.

2. **Movies in Series**: A third of the movies are in series. Therefore, the number of movies in series is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]

3. **Remaining Movies (Not in Series)**: The remaining movies that are not in series are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older Movies**: 40% of the remaining movies (not in series) are older movies. Therefore, the number of older movies is:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]

5. **Newer Movies**: The rest of the movies that are not in series and not older are newer movies. Therefore, the number of newer movies is:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - **Cost of Movies in Series**: Each movie in a series costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for movies in series is:
     \[
     200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   
   - **Cost of Older Movies**: Each older movie costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for older movies is:
     \[
     160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   
   - **Cost of Newer Movies**: Each newer movie costs $10. Therefore, the total cost for newer movies is:
     \[
     240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Total Cost**: Add up the costs for all categories:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}

The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them, because on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. How many people sang in the performance?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of girls in the choir:**
   - The choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

2. **Determine how many girls were supposed to perform:**
   - Initially, all 26 girls were supposed to perform.

3. **Account for the bus breakdown:**
   - Half of the girls can't make it to the show due to the bus breakdown.
   - Number of girls who can't make it = 50% of 26 = 0.5 * 26 = 13 girls.
   - Number of girls who can still perform = 26 - 13 = 13 girls.

4. **Include the teachers:**
   - The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls.

She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. The laptop Erika wants costs $600. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cost of the new laptop:** $600

2. **Reduction from trading in the old laptop:** $200  
   - New effective cost of the laptop after trade-in: $600 - $200 = $400

3. **Contribution from Erika's mom:** $80

4. **Earnings from Erika's part-time job:** $150

5. **Total money Erika has from her mom and job:** $80 (from mom) + $150 (from job) = $230

6. **Total amount Erika needs to buy the laptop:** $400 (effective cost after trade-in)

7. **Amount Erika still needs to buy the laptop:** $50

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has in her purse:

- Total amount needed to buy the laptop: $400
- Total amount Erika has from her mom and job: $230
- Amount she still needs: $50

To find out how much Erika has in her purse, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total money from mom and job} + \text{Money in purse} = \text{Total amount needed} - \text{Amount still needed} \]

\[ 230 + \text{Money in purse} = 400 - 50 \]

\[ 230 + \text{Money in purse} = 350 \]

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 350 - 230 \]

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day over the course of a week.

1. **Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week:**
   - Felix made $105 in total.
   - He charges $0.25 per branch.
   - To find the total number of branches climbed, we divide the total earnings by the charge per branch:
     \[
     \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \times 4 = 420
     \]
   - So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

2. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - To find the average number of branches climbed per day, divide the total number of branches by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{420}{7} = 60

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students will participate in the escape room and how long it will take for all of them to complete it.

1. **Determine the number of students per grade:**
   - There are 10 students from each grade (grades 4 through 7) who get to try the escape room.
   - There are 4 grades in total (grades 4, 5, 6, and 7).

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Total students = 10 students/grade × 4 grades = 40 students.

3. **Determine the number of groups needed:**
   - Each group can have a maximum of 8 students.
   - Number of groups needed = Total students / Students per group = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

4. **Calculate the total time required:**
   - Each group uses 45 minutes to try the escape room.
   - Total time = Number of groups × Time per group = 5 groups × 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear for all three grandchildren and then sum them up.

1. **Hat**: 
   - It takes 2 skeins of wool to make one hat.
   - Martha wants to make one hat for each of her 3 grandchildren.
   - Total skeins for hats = 2 skeins/hat × 3 hats = 6 skeins.

2. **Scarf**: 
   - It takes 4 skeins of wool to make one scarf.
   - Martha wants to make one scarf for each of her 3 grandchildren.
   - Total skeins for scarves = 4 skeins/scarf × 3 scarves = 12 skeins.

3. **Sweater**: 
   - It takes 12 skeins of wool to make one sweater.
   - Martha wants to make one sweater for each of her 3 grandchildren.

Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break down the events step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees 1/2 of the 30 bees return. 
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back.

By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine which type of scent sold more, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent.

1. **Calculate the total sales for vanilla scents:**
   - The company sells 5 of each vanilla scent.
   - There are 4 vanilla scents available.
   - Total sales for vanilla scents = 5 sales/scent * 4 scents = 20 sales.

2. **Calculate the total sales for fruity scents:**
   - The company sells 2 of each fruity scent.
   - There are 8 fruity scents available.
   - Total sales for fruity scents = 2 sales/scent * 8 scents = 16 sales.

3. **Determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents:**
   - Difference in sales = Total sales for vanilla scents - Total sales for fruity scents
   - Difference in sales = 20 sales (vanilla) - 16 sales (fruity) = 4 sales.

He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on vacation. We know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing and 30% of his time on specific activities, which include boating, swimming, and watching shows.

Let's break down the activities:

1. **Boating:** John spent 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming:** He spent half the time swimming as he did boating, so he spent \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours swimming.
3. **Watching Shows:** He watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, so he spent \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:

- Total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours.

These activities account for 30% of his total vacation time. Let \( T \) be the total time he spent on vacation. Therefore, 30% of \( T \) is 15 hours:

\[ 0.3T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), divide both sides by 0.3:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now that we know the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours, we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total time:

\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.4 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price.  The original price of each T-shirt is $8. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, taking into account the discounts, and then add them together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts.

   For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price of $8.

   For the second T-shirt, Jake gets 50% off, so he pays:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } \$8 = 0.5 \times 8 = \$4
   \]

   Therefore, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
   \[
   \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off.

   The discount on the shoes is:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$40 = 0.4 \times 40 = \$16
   \]

   Therefore, the discounted price of the shoes is:
   \[
   \$40 - \$16 = \$24
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for T-shirts: $12
   - Total cost for shoes: $24

   Adding these together gives the total amount Jake spends:
   \[
   \$12 + \$24 = \$36
   \]

He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans in the jar based on the given information and then compare it to the true number of red jelly beans.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   - The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   - Volume of the jar = base area × height = 6 inches × 6 inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

2. **Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans:**
   - The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans.
   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches × 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**
   - Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   - Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   - Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   - Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans × 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

5. **Calculate how far off Tim's guess is:**
   - The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   - Difference = True number - Estimated number = 900 - 864 = 36.

If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic Milo can create with the glass chips he has, and then use that to find out how long the mosaic can be given its height.

1. **Determine the total number of glass chips:**
   - Milo has two bags of glass chips.
   - Each bag contains 72 chips.
   - Total number of chips = 2 bags × 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

2. **Calculate the total area in square inches Milo can cover:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to cover one square inch.
   - Total area in square inches = Total number of chips ÷ Chips per square inch
   - Total area = 144 chips ÷ 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

3. **Determine the dimensions of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Let the length of the mosaic be \( L \) inches.
   - The area of the mosaic is given by the formula: Area = Height × Length
   - We know the area is 12 square inches and the height is 3 inches.
   - Therefore, 12 square inches = 3 inches × \( L \) inches.

4. **Solve for the length \( L \):**

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses in her salt scrub, given the relationships between the ingredients and the total volume of the scrub.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
   - Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
   - Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

2. **Relationships:**
   - The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

3. **Total Volume:**
   - The total volume of the scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore, the sum of all the ingredients is:
     \[
     z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
     \]
   - Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     2z + 3s = 10
     \]

4. **Substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation:**
   - Replace \( s \) with \( 2z \) in the equation:
     \[
     2z + 3(2z) = 10
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2z + 6z = 10
     \]
     \[
     8z = 10
     \]
   - Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     z = \frac{10}{8} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25
     \]

5. **Calculate \( s \) and oil:**
   - Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( z = 1.25 \):
     \[
     s = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.5
     \]
   - The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt:
     \[
     \text{Oil} = 2s = 2 \times 2.5 = 5
     \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil in her salt scrub.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the pet store. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Fish in the Pond:**
   - Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

2. **Fish Bought from the Pet Store:**
   - Bob bought a total of 17 fish from the pet store. These fish were a mix of white and orange fish.

3. **Final Fish Count in the Pond:**
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

4. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.
   - We know that \( x + y = 17 \) because he bought 17 fish in total.

5. **Final Fish Count Equations:**
   - The total number of white fish in the pond is \( 4 + x \).
   - The total number of orange fish in the pond is \( 3 + y \).
   - According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish: 
     \[
     3 + y = 2(4 + x)
     \]

6. **Solving the Equations:**
   - From the equation \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 17 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 17 - x \) into the equation \( 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \):
     \[
     3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)
     \]
     \[
     20 - x = 8 + 2x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     20 - 8 = 2x + x
     \]
     \[
     12 = 3x
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Bob bought 4 white fish from the pet store.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each color of bumper cars and then find out how many yellow cars there are.

1. **Determine the number of green cars:**
   - The rink has 12 red cars.
   - They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Therefore, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).

2. **Determine the number of blue cars:**
   - Let the number of blue cars be \(b\).
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.
   - Therefore, the number of blue cars is \(b = \frac{10}{3}\).

3. **Determine the number of yellow cars:**
   - Let the number of yellow cars be \(y\).
   - The total number of cars is 75.
   - The equation for the total number of cars is:
     \[
     12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + b \text{ (blue)} + y \text{ (yellow)} = 75
     \]
   - Substitute the value of \(b\) from step 2:
     \[
     12 + 10 + \frac{10}{3} + y = 75
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     22 + \frac{10}{3} + y = 75
     \]
   - Convert 22 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     \frac{66}{3} + \frac{10}{3} + y = 75
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{76}{3} + y = 75
     \]
   - Subtract \(\frac{76}{3}\) from both sides:
     \[
     y = 75 - \frac{76}{3}
     \]
   - Convert 75 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     y = \frac{225}{3} - \frac{76}{3}
     \]
   - Subtract the fractions:
     \[
     y = \frac{149}{3}
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     y = 49.67
     \]

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, it seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

1. **Re-evaluate the number of blue cars:**
   - The number of blue cars should be a whole number, so let's assume the number of blue cars is \(b\).
   - The number of green cars is 10, and the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars:
     \[
     b = 3 \times 10 = 30
     \]

2. **Re-evaluate the number of yellow cars:**
   - Now, substitute the correct value of \(b\) into the total equation:
     \[
     12 + 10 + 30 + y = 75
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     52 + y = 75
     \]
   - Solve for \(y\):
     \[
     y = 75 - 52 = 23
     \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

The watch was originally $2000, but was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The watch was on sale for 75% of its original price.
   - Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers paid is:

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's define some variables and set up equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls in the third set.
3. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls in the first set.

According to the problem, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[
2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

3. Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

5. Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

3. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning feed = 15 cups
   - Afternoon feed = 25 cups
   - Total feed given in morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

4. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total feed needed per day = 60 cups
   - Feed already given (morning + afternoon) = 40 cups
   - Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed per day - Feed already given
   - Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Sentences Edited per Week**: Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

2. **Sentences Edited per Publisher**: Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for Publisher A and Publisher B, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

3. **Payment from Publisher A**: Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Payment from Publisher B**: Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 \times 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Let's go through the steps to calculate the total number of petals on the flowers that Rose puts in the vase:

1. **Initial Picking:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Dropping Flowers:**
   - Rose drops 1 flower from each type she initially picked:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: 
       \[
       5 \text{ petals lost}
       \]
     - 1 flower with 6 petals:
       \[
       6 \text{ petals lost}

3. **Picking More Flowers:**
   - Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She drops 1 of these flowers:
     \[
     7 \text{ petals lost}
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Petals:**
   - Total petals picked initially:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Total petals lost:
     \[
     5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Total petals in the vase:

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all possible scenarios where he does not get an extension or a pass on turning in his homework.

1. **Normal Teacher with Class Extension:**
   - Probability of normal teacher giving a class extension = 40%
   - Probability of normal teacher not giving a class extension = 100% - 40% = 60%

2. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher = 50%
   - If there is a substitute teacher, the homework will not be collected.

3. **Normal Teacher without Class Extension and Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension = 20%
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension = 100% - 20% = 80%

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Scenario 1:** Normal teacher, no class extension, no personal extension.
  - Probability = Probability of normal teacher * Probability of no class extension * Probability of no personal extension
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

- **Scenario 2:** Substitute teacher.
  - Probability = 50%
  - In this case, the homework is not collected, so this scenario does not contribute to Marcus having to turn in his homework.

The only scenario where Marcus has to turn in his homework is Scenario 1. Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 24%.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Cameron would save by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark, we need to calculate the total cost for both options and compare them.

1. **Calculate the duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 10 am is a total of 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
   - Cameron stays for 17 hours, which is 5 hours more than the 12-hour stay.
   - For each additional hour beyond 12 hours, the cost is 70 pesos.
   - Additional cost for 5 hours = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for this option = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay with additional hours
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for a 24-hour stay.

After 2 hours, it turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than before. After one hour, he increases the weight that he uses by 50%. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight.

2. **After 2 Hours**: He finds the 8-pound weight too heavy and switches to a weight that is 2 pounds lighter. 
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}

   So, he is now using a 6-pound weight.

3. **After 1 More Hour**: He increases the weight by 50%.
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 6 \text{ pounds} = 0.5 \times 6 = 3 \text{ pounds}

How many miles does the last dog need?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to consider the information given:

1. Bernie has 4 dogs.
2. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
3. The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
4. The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
5. On average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of miles all four dogs need to walk together. Since the average is 3 miles per dog, and there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the miles for the first three dogs:

- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Total for the first three dogs:

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the overall total to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk:

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate \u00be of their pizzas. Each pizza had 12 slices. How many slices of pizza were left?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza were left after Bryce and his friends ate their portions.

1. **Determine the total number of pizzas and slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizza, so there are 5 pizzas in total.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends (3 people) ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Each person ate 2/3 of their pizza, so each ate 2/3 × 12 slices = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by these 3 people = 3 people × 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends:**
   - The two remaining friends each ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Each person ate 3/4 × 12 slices = 9 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by these 2 people = 2 people × 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

4. **Calculate the total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten by all 5 friends = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 42 slices.

How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars and then subtract this from the total revenue from selling the jars.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.**

- **Passion fruit cost for one jar:**
  - 2 pounds of passion fruit per jar
  - Cost per pound = $6
  - Total cost for passion fruit per jar = 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12

- **Jackfruit cost for one jar:**
  - 1.5 pounds of jackfruit per jar
  - Cost per pound = $8
  - Total cost for jackfruit per jar = 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12

- **Honey cost for one jar:**
  - 2 pounds of honey per jar
  - Cost per pound = $10
  - Total cost for honey per jar = 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

- **Total cost for ingredients per jar:**
  - Total cost per jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars.**

- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 jars * $44/jar = $440

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.**

- Selling price per jar = $50
- Total revenue for 10 jars = 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

How much did he make?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much James made, we need to calculate the profit on the cars he sold and then find his commission based on that profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   - Each car costs $25,000.
   - The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.

2. **Calculate the profit per car:**
   - Selling price per car = $25,000.
   - Acquisition cost per car = $7,500.
   - Profit per car = Selling price - Acquisition cost = $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

3. **Calculate the total profit for 10 cars:**
   - Profit per car = $17,500.

   - Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, and he needs at least 54 glue sticks, he must round up to the next whole number.
   - Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs.

5. **Verify the calculation:**
   - 7 packs × 8 glue sticks/pack = 56 glue sticks.
   - 56 glue sticks are enough to give each of the 27 students 2 glue sticks, with 2 glue sticks left over.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 lbs:**
   - Since 1 pound of body weight is approximately equivalent to 3500 calories, losing 30 lbs would require a total calorie deficit of:
     \[
     30 \, \text{lbs} \times 3500 \, \text{calories/lb} = 105,000 \, \text{calories}
     \]

2. **Determine the time frame for achieving the goal:**
   - Andy wants to lose the weight by July 19th, starting from December 31st. We need to calculate the number of days between these two dates.
   - From December 31st to July 19th, the months and days are as follows:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days
   - Total number of days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required:**
   - To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
     \[
     \frac{105,000 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{days}} = 525 \, \text{calories/day}
     \]

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quarters each person uses during the 4-hour period and then sum them up.

1. **Convert hours to minutes:**
   - 4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes.

2. **Determine how long each person can play with one quarter:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
   - Two of his friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with one quarter.
   - One friend can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 × 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

3. **Calculate the number of quarters each person uses:**
   - **Jack:** 
     - Total playtime = 240 minutes.
     - Number of quarters = 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
   - **Two friends (each):**
     - Total playtime = 240 minutes.
     - Number of quarters = 240 / 10 = 24 quarters.
     - Since there are two friends, total quarters for both = 24 × 2 = 48 quarters.
   - **One friend:**
     - Total playtime = 240 minutes.
     - Number of quarters = 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

4. **Sum up the quarters used by all:**
   - Total quarters = Jack's quarters + Two friends' quarters + One friend's quarters
   - Total quarters = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

5. **Convert quarters to dollars:**
   - Each quarter is $0.25.
   - Total money used = 68 quarters × $0.25 = $17.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of popcorn kernels that pop during each time interval and then sum them up.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Three times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop.
   - \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.

3. **Next 60 seconds (after the first minute):**
   - The popping rate increases to four times the initial rate after 60 seconds.
   - The initial rate is 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so four times this rate is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - For the next 30 seconds, 80 kernels pop.

4. **Final 30 seconds of cooking:**
   - The popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds.
   - Half of 80 is \(80 / 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

5. **After taking the pan off the heat:**
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking pop from the residual heat.
   - A quarter of 40 is \(40 / 4 = 10\) kernels pop.

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- After taking off the heat: 10 kernels

Total kernels popped = \(20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210\).

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum them up.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - The farmer buys two 1-pound boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 boxes × 1 pound/box = 2 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - The farmer buys twenty 65-pound sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 sacks × 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - The farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 bales × 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

4. **Carrots:**
   - The farmer buys four 12-pound bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 bags × 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.

Now, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:

- Total weight = Weight of sugar cubes + Weight of oats + Weight of hay + Weight of carrots
- Total weight = 2 pounds + 1300 pounds + 3150 pounds + 48 pounds
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number, since a partial trip still requires a full trip.

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

Since 4500 pounds is exactly twice the truck's capacity, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips.

The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially for each year.

1. **Initial Value of the Boat:**
   - The initial purchase price of the boat is $9,000.

2. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9,000 = 0.30 * $9,000 = $2,700.
   - Value of the boat after the first year = $9,000 - $2,700 = $6,300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6,300 = 0.30 * $6,300 = $1,890.
