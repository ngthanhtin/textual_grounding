Each <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">box</span> weighs <span class="number5" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">8 ounces</span>, so the total weight of the <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">boxes</span> is \( 25 \times 8 = 200 \) ounces.<br><br>Now, find the <span class="concept2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">total weight</span> of the <span class="object1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">crayons</span> and the <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">boxes</span> in ounces: \( 200 + 200 = 400 \) ounces.<br><br>Finally, convert the <span class="concept2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">total weight</span> from ounces to <span class="concept1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">pounds</span>.

Therefore, there are 8 sodas left in total. The probability that <span class="person3" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">Ellen's friend</span> gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/8.

(Round to the nearest integer.)<br><br>Answer Reasoning:<br>To determine the <span class="concept" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">cost per serving</span>, we first calculate the total cost of the ingredients. <span class="person" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">Antoine</span> needs <span class="number1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2 pounds of onions</span>, but he likes to <span class="concept" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">double that amount</span>, so he will use 4 pounds of onions. The cost for the <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">onions</span> is <span class="number2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$2.00 a pound</span>, so the total cost for onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 = $8.00. <br><br><span class="person" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">He</span> also needs <span class="number4" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">2 boxes of beef stock</span>, with each box costing <span class="number5" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">$2.00 a box</span>. Therefore, the total cost for the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 = $4.00.<br><br>Adding these costs together, the total cost for the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.<br><br>The <span class="object1" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">soup</span> serves <span class="number3" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">6 people</span>, so the <span class="concept" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">cost per serving</span> is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.<br><br>Final Answer: {2}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>

The price for such a <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">crate</span> depends on the price of its individual fruits. One <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">crate</span> of such fruit consists of <span class="number1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">5 bananas</span>, <span class="number2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">12 apples</span>, and <span class="number3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">7 oranges</span>. <span class="object3" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">Oranges</span> are the most expensive and cost <span class="number4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">three times as much as a banana</span> per piece.

The cost of one <span class="object4" style="background-color: lightseagreen; font-weight: bold;">apple</span> is <span class="number5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">$0.5</span>.

One <span class="object5" style="background-color: lightskyblue; font-weight: bold;">banana</span> costs <span class="number6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">twice as much</span> as an apple, so it costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar. Therefore, the cost for <span class="number1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">5 bananas</span> is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.<br><br>3. One <span class="object3" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">orange</span> costs <span class="number4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">three times as much as a banana</span>, so it costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars. Therefore, the cost for <span class="number3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">7 oranges</span> is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.<br><br>Adding these costs together gives the total price for the <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">crate</span> of fruit: \(6 + 5 + 21 = 32\) dollars.<br><br>Final Answer: {32}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>32</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 32</div></div>

We know he spent <span class="number2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">30%</span> of his time on specific activities: <span class="time1" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">6 hours</span> boating, half of that time swimming (which is 3 hours), and watching <span class="number3" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">3</span> shows that were <span class="time2" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">2 hours</span> each (totaling 6 hours). Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. Since this represents <span class="number2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">30%</span> of his total vacation time, we can calculate the total time by dividing 15 hours by 0.3, which gives us 50 hours. <span class="person" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">John</span> spent <span class="number1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">40%</span> of this total time <span class="concept" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">sightseeing</span>, so 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.<br><br>Final Answer: {20}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>20</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 20</div></div>

How far off was his guess?<br><br>Answer Reasoning:<br>To find out how far off <span class="person" style="background-color: lightskyblue; font-weight: bold;">Tim</span>'s guess was, we need to calculate his estimated number of red jelly beans. First, we calculate the volume of the <span class="object2" style="background-color: lightseagreen; font-weight: bold;">jar</span> using its dimensions: <span class="number4" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">6 inches by 6 inches</span> and <span class="number5" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">15 inches tall</span>.
