Jujutsu is a form of martial arts that involves grappling, joint locks, and throws, which typically require the use of multiple limbs for effective execution.

The <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Dominican Order</span>, also known as the Order of Preachers, is a Catholic religious order founded by Saint Dominic in the early 13th century. It is known for its focus on preaching, teaching, and theological scholarship.<br><br>2. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Blessed Gerard's order</span> refers to the Order of Saint John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller.

Typically, high-ranking officials may have diplomatic immunity, which can protect them from prosecution under certain circumstances. However, <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">committing crimes</span> in a foreign country like the <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">U.K.</span> does not automatically mean they are <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">immune from arrest</span>. Diplomatic immunity is subject to international laws and agreements, and it does not cover all types of crimes, especially serious offenses. Therefore, while the Secretary of State might have some protections, it is not absolute, and they could potentially be arrested depending on the nature of the crime and the diplomatic agreements in place.<br><br>Final_Answer: {No, they cannot commit crimes without the risk of being arrested, as diplomatic immunity has limitations.}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>false</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> true</div></div>

He was a leader during the First Crusade, which was a military expedition by Western Christianity to reclaim Jerusalem and other holy lands from Muslim control.
