<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training. During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power. The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members. To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year. The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power. Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers ’views?
(A) This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> The secret of the “age” of human male and female ancestors is hidden in the Y chromosome and mitochondria. The Y chromosome only passes from father to son, while mitochondria only pass from mother to daughter. Looking back through these two genetic materials, we can find that all men have a common male ancestor "Y chromosome Adam", and all women have a common female ancestor "mitochondrial Eve". The researchers conducted genome sequencing and comparative analysis of 69 males from nine different populations, such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and found that this male common ancestor "Y chromosome Adam" was formed about 156,000 to 120,000 years ago. Using the same technical analysis of mitochondria, the researchers also calculated that this female common ancestor "mitochondrial Eve" was formed between 148,000 and 99,000 years ago. Which of the following is most appropriate as a corollary of the above discussion?
(A) "Y chromosome Adam" and "mitochondrial Eve" were formed in the same period, and "age" is close, "Y chromosome Adam" may be earlier. (B) 5 years ago, there was only one man "Adam" on earth. (C) As two individuals, "Adam" and "Eve" should never meet. (D) Men and women are born together and have conceived modern humans together.</div><div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> </div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>A</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> A</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Research has found that insects “breathe” through the stomata system on their bodies. The stomata are connected to the trachea, and more and more layers of smaller and smaller air are attached from top to bottom, thereby bringing oxygen to the whole body. At the current level of oxygen in the atmosphere, the total length of the stomata system has reached the limit; if the total length exceeds this limit, the oxygen supply capacity will be insufficient. Therefore, it can be judged that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects. Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?
(A) Studies of invertebrates in the ocean have also found that in colder water and with higher oxygen content, the organisms there are also larger. (B) During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth ’s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%. At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter. (C) Small locusts cannot survive in a low-oxygen environment, especially in an environment with an oxygen concentration below 15%. Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> By analyzing the light released or absorbed by the atoms of an object, you can measure whether the object is far away from the earth or close to the earth. When the object is far away from the earth, the frequency of these lights will move to the red end (low frequency) of the spectrum, referred to as "red shift" "On the contrary, it is called" blue shift ". The unique light emitted by the atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially the electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons it releases will also become higher, so the release and absorption frequencies will be blue-shifted. Conversely, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will be red-shifted. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have a redshift phenomenon. Moreover, the farther the galaxy is from the earth, the greater the redshift. According to this, many scientists believe that the universe must be constantly expanding.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A solid wood flooring seller solemnly promised in his contract text? "The flooring sold in this shop is definitely made of wood; it is responsible for free installation, except for the cost of materials required for installation; free warranty for one year, but not the fault of the company Except for the losses caused. If there is fraud, the company is willing to bear legal responsibility and pay more than 1,000 times the compensation. The company reserves the right to interpret this contract. ". Which of the following options is a correct evaluation of the company and its contract?
(A) The company must be very honest because it promises to pay more than 1,000 times in compensation if fraud is discovered. (B) The company's contract actually has no binding force on its behavior. (C) The floors sold by the company must be real solid wood floors. (D) From the customer's perspective, the company's contract terms are acceptable.</div><div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> To evaluate the contract, we should consider the binding effect and sincerity of the clauses provided by the company. Let's analyze each option:

(A) The company's willingness to pay more than 1,000 times in compensation if fraud is discovered might seem sincere, but it does not necessarily confirm honesty. It is possible to make bold promises without intent to follow through or with terms difficult to prove.

(B) The contract includes a clause stating that the company reserves the right to interpret the contract. This could potentially limit the binding force of the contract, as it provides the company with significant control over how the contract is interpreted. This kind of clause might render the contract less reliable and give the company leeway to manipulate terms to its advantage.

(C) The company claims in the contract that the floors are definitely made of wood. However, the mere statement does not guarantee the material's authenticity unless backed by independent verification. Therefore, this cannot be taken as definitive proof that the floors are real solid wood simply because it is in the contract.

(D) From a customer's perspective, the contract offers several beneficial terms like free installation and a one-year free warranty. However, the free warranty has an exclusion clause, and given the company's broad right to interpret the contract, there is room for dispute and ambiguity, which could be concerning for customers.

Considering these points, option (B) seems to highlight the potential issue of the contract's binding power due to the company's self-reserved right to interpret it, which can undermine its effectiveness.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>B</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> B</div></div>
