Reformatted_Question: For <fact1>every 12 cans</fact1> you recycle, <fact2>you receive $0.50</fact2>, and for <fact3>every 5 kilograms of newspapers</fact3>, <fact4>you receive $1.50</fact4>. If your family collected <fact5>144 cans</fact5> and <fact6>20 kilograms of newspapers</fact6>, how much money would you receive?
