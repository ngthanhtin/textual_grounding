Question: Among the various models of Delta vacuum cleaners, one cannot accurately predict how effectively a particular model cleans simply by determining how powerful its motor is. The efficiency of dust filtration systems varies significantly, even between models of Delta vacuum cleaners equipped with identically powerful motors. The argument's conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Answer Choices:
(a) All Delta vacuum cleaners that clean equally effectively have identically powerful motors.
(b) One cannot accurately assess how effectively any Delta vacuum cleaner cleans without knowing how powerful that vacuum cleaner's motor is.
(c) For each Delta vacuum cleaner, the efficiency of its dust filtration system has a significant impact on how effectively it cleans.
(d) For any two Delta vacuum cleaners with equally efficient dust filtration systems, the one with the more powerful motor cleans more effectively.
Reformatted Question: Among the various models of Delta vacuum cleaners, <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a particular model cleans</fact1> simply by <fact2>determining how powerful its motor is</fact2>. The efficiency of <fact3>dust filtration systems varies significantly</fact3>, even between models of <fact4>Delta vacuum cleaners equipped with identically powerful motors</fact4>. The argument's conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Answer: The argument states that <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a Delta vacuum cleaner cleans</fact1> by just <fact2>knowing the power of its motor</fact2> because <fact3>dust filtration systems differ significantly</fact3> even between <fact4>models that have motors of the same power</fact4>.
A does not align with the argument, as the efficiency of the <fact3>dust filtration systems was noted to vary significantly</fact3>, making <fact2>motor power alone insufficient to predict cleaning effectiveness</fact2>.
B seems partially relevant, but the argument suggests that <fact2>motor power alone is not enough to determine effectiveness</fact2> due to the role of dust filtration systems.
C directly aligns with the argument. The <fact3>efficiency of the dust filtration system</fact3> is emphasized as a key factor, even for models with the same motor power.
D contradicts the argument by suggesting that motor power is the main factor, but the argument highlights <fact3>the varying dust filtration systems</fact3>.
The answer is {C}.

Question: Scientists examined diamonds that were formed on Earth about 2. 9 billion years ago. These diamonds had a higher-than-normal concentration of sulfur-33. This concentration can be explained only by certain chemical reactions that are stimulated by ultraviolet light. If there had been more than a trace of oxygen in Earth' s atmosphere 2. 9 billion years ago, then not enough ultraviolet light would have reached Earth' s surface to stimulate the chemical reactions. The information above most strongly supports which one of the following?
Answer Choices:
(a) Earth's atmosphere contained very little, if any, oxygen 2. 9 billion years ago.
(b) Most diamonds with higher-than-normal concentrations of sulfur-33 were formed at least 2. 9 billion years ago.
(c) Ultraviolet light causes the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere to react chemically with sulfur-33.
(d) The formation of diamonds occurs only in the presence of ultraviolet light.
Reformatted Question: Scientists examined diamonds that were formed on Earth about 2.9 billion years ago. These diamonds had a <fact2>higher-than-normal concentration of sulfur-33.</fact2> This concentration can be explained only by <fact3>certain chemical reactions that are stimulated by ultraviolet light.</fact3> If there had been more than a trace of <fact4>oxygen in Earth's atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact4>, then not enough <fact3>ultraviolet light</fact3> would have reached Earth's surface to stimulate the chemical reactions. The information above most strongly supports which one of the following?
Answer: The key point is that <fact3>ultraviolet light</fact3> was necessary for the <fact3>chemical reactions</fact3>, but <fact4>high levels of oxygen</fact4> would have blocked that light. This suggests that <fact4>oxygen levels</fact4> must have been very low or nearly absent during this time for the reactions to occur.
Therefore, the <fact2>diamonds' high sulfur-33 concentration</fact2> indicates that <fact4>Earth's atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact4> had very little oxygen.
A directly aligns with the argument since it matches the conditions required for <fact3>ultraviolet light</fact3> to reach Earth's surface and cause the reactions.
B is unrelated to the argument, which focuses on the specific conditions of the <fact4>atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact4>, not the overall formation of diamonds. 
C is incorrect because <fact3>ultraviolet light</fact3> facilitates the reaction, but <fact4>oxygen</fact4> would block the light, not cause a reaction with <fact2>sulfur-33</fact2>. 
D is also incorrect as the argument does not state that <fact3>ultraviolet light</fact3> is necessary for <fact2>diamond formation</fact2>, only that it explains the <fact2>sulfur-33 concentration</fact2>. 
The answer is {A}.

Question: In recent years, many cabinetmakers have been winning acclaim as artists. But since furniture must be useful, cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to the practical utility of their product. For this reason, cabinetmaking is not art. Which of the following is an assumption that supports drawing the conclusion above from the reason given for that conclusion?
Answer Choices:
(a) Some furniture is made to be placed in museums, where it will not be used by anyone.
(b) Artists are not concerned with the monetary value of their products.
(c) Cabinetmakers should be more concerned with the practical utility of their products than they currently are.
(d) An object is not an art object if its maker pays attention to the object's practical utility.
Reformatted Question: In recent years, many <fact1>cabinetmakers have been winning acclaim as artists</fact1>. But since <fact2>furniture must be useful</fact2>, <fact3>cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to the practical utility of their product</fact3>. For this reason, <fact4>cabinetmaking is not art</fact4>. Which of the following is an assumption that supports drawing the conclusion above from the reason given for that conclusion?
Answer: Premise: <fact3>Cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to practical utility</fact3>. Conclusion: <fact4>Cabinetmaking is not art</fact4>.
The question asks for an assumption that supports drawing this conclusion from the given reason. To bridge the gap between the premise and the conclusion, we need an assumption that links <fact3>practical utility</fact3> to the definition of <fact1>art</fact1>.
A This statement about <fact2>museum furniture</fact2> doesn't help connect <fact3>practical utility</fact3> to the definition of <fact1>art</fact1>. It's irrelevant to the argument.
B The monetary value of <fact1>art</fact1> is not mentioned in the original argument and doesn't relate to <fact3>practical utility</fact3>. This is also irrelevant.
C This is a normative statement about what <fact1>cabinetmakers</fact1> should do, but it doesn't help us determine whether cabinetmaking is art or not based on <fact3>practical utility</fact3>.
D This statement directly connects <fact3>practical utility</fact3> to the definition of <fact1>art</fact1>. It states that if an object's maker considers <fact3>practical utility</fact3>, then the object is not <fact1>art</fact1>. This assumption would indeed allow us to conclude that <fact4>cabinetmaking is not art</fact4> based on the premise that <fact1>cabinetmakers</fact1> consider <fact3>practical utility</fact3>.
The answer is {D}.

Question: Doctor: There will be more local cases of flu infection this year than there were last year. In addition to the strains of flu that were present in this area last year, a new strain has infected some people this year. The conclusion of the doctor's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Answer Choices:
(a) It is rare for new strains of flu to appear.
(b) The new strain of flu cannot be addressed with the approaches used to deal with the strains of flu that were present last year.
(c) There will be no decline this year in the number of cases of flu infection due to strains that were present last year.
(d) The new strain of flu is expected to be more dangerous than the strains of flu that were present last year.
Reformatted Question: Doctor: <fact1>There will be more local cases of flu infection this year than there were last year</fact1>. In addition to the strains of flu that were present in this area last year, a <fact2>new strain has infected some people this year</fact2>. The conclusion of the doctor's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Answer: A is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn't address the relationship between <fact2>the new strain</fact2> and <fact1>the predicted increase in flu infections</fact1>.
B focuses on treatment approaches, which is unrelated to <fact1>the premise about the number of flu cases</fact1>.
C directly aligns with the reasoning of the argument, stating that there will be <fact1>no decline in the number of cases due to last year's flu strains</fact1>, which supports the conclusion about <fact1>the increase in overall cases this year</fact1>.
D introduces the idea of the <fact2>new strain</fact2> being more dangerous, but the argument is focused on the total number of cases rather than the severity of the strain.
The answer is {C}.

Question: The growing popularity of computer-based activities was widely expected to result in a decline in television viewing, since it had been assumed that people lack sufficient free time to maintain current television-viewing levels while spending increasing amounts of free time on the computer. That assumption, however, is evidently false: in a recent mail survey concerning media use, a very large majority of respondents who report increasing time spent per week using computers report no change in time spent watching television. In order to evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to determine which of the following?
Answer Choices:
(a) Whether a large majority of the computer owners in the survey reported spending increasing amounts of time per week using computers
(b) Whether the survey collected information about the amount of money respondents spent on free-time media use
(c) Whether the amount of time spent watching television is declining among people who report that they rarely or never use computers
(d) Whether the survey respondents' reports of time spent using computers included time spent using computers at work
Reformatted Question: The <fact1>growing popularity of computer-based activities</fact1> was<fact2> widely expected to result in a decline in television viewing</fact2>, since <fact3>it had been assumed</fact3> that <fact4>people lack sufficient free time</fact4> to <fact5>maintain current television-viewing levels</fact5> while <fact5>spending increasing amounts of free time on the computer</fact5>. <fact6>That assumption, however, is evidently false</fact6>: <fact7>in a recent mail survey concerning media use</fact7>, <fact8>a very large majority of respondents who report increasing time spent per week using computers</fact8> <fact9>report no change in time spent watching television</fact9>. In order to evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to determine which of the following?
Answer: The argument is <fact6>based on the assumption</fact6> that <fact8>people who spend more time on computers</fact8> would <fact2>reduce the time spent watching television</fact2> due to a <fact5>limited amount of free time</fact5>. However, the survey indicates that <fact6>this is not the case</fact6>, as people report <fact9>no change in television viewing</fact9> despite <fact8>increasing computer use</fact8>. To properly evaluate the argument, we need to check whether the survey's findings might be influenced by factors that have not been accounted for. If the reported <fact1>increase in computer time</fact1> includes work-related activities, then the assumption that the increase in computer use should reduce television time during leisure could be invalid. People might be increasing their work-related computer use, which wouldn't necessarily impact their <fact5>free-time television viewing</fact5>.
The answer is {D}.

Question: The Great Sphinx is a huge statue in Egypt that has a lion' s body with a man' s head. The face of the Sphinx has long been claimed to be that of pharaoh Khafre, who lived around 2600 B. C. , but it cannot be: erosion patterns recently discovered on the lion' s legs can only have been caused by heavy rains, and the Sahara has not had heavy rains in over 10, 000 years. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Answer Choices:
(a) Other erosion patterns that appear on the body of the Sphinx are of a sort that could be caused by wind and sand alone
(b) The face of the Sphinx bears a resemblance to the faces on certain stylized statues dating from both before and after the reign of Khafre.
(c) Other than the Sphinx, there are no surviving sculptures that have been claimed to portray the face of Khafre.
(d) The face of the Sphinx is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may have been recarved long after the Sphinx was built.
Reformatted Question: <fact1>The Great Sphinx is a huge statue in Egypt</fact1> that <fact2>has a lion' s body with a man' s head</fact2>. <fact3>The face of the Sphinx has long been claimed to be that of pharaoh Khafre</fact3>, <fact4>who lived around 2600 B. C.</fact4> , <fact5>but it cannot be</fact5>: <fact6>erosion patterns recently discovered on the lion' s legs</fact6> can <fact7>only have been caused by heavy rains</fact7>, and the <fact8>Sahara has not had heavy rains in over 10, 000 years</fact8>. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Answer: The argument claims that <fact3>the face of the Sphinx</fact3> <fact5>cannot belong to Pharaoh Khafre</fact5> because <fact6>erosion patterns on the Sphinx’s legs</fact6> suggest the statue predates Khafre by thousands of years, due to <fact8>heavy rains that haven't occurred in the Sahara for over 10,000 years</fact8>. To weaken this argument, we need information that suggests the Sphinx could have been altered or modified after its initial construction, making it possible for <fact3>Khafre's face</fact3> to be carved on it at a later time. If the face was recarved later, the original construction of the Sphinx could be much older, aligning with the <fact6>erosion patterns</fact6>, while still allowing <fact3>Khafre’s face</fact3> to have been added later. 
The answer is {D}.

Question: Lawyer: Did Congleton assign the best available graphic artist to the project? Witness: Yes. Lawyer: And the best writer? Witness: Yes. Lawyer: In fact everyone she assigned to work on the project was top notch? Witness: That' s true. Lawyer: So, you lied to the court when you said, earlier, that Congleton wanted the project to fail? Each of the following accurately describes a flaw in the lawyer's reasoning displayed above EXCEPT:
Answer Choices:
(a) It takes for granted that Congleton was not forced to assign the people she did to the project.
(b) It ignores the possibility that the witness failed to infer from known facts what should have been inferred and therefore was not lying.
(c) It takes for granted that the project could fail only if Congleton wanted it to fail.
(d) It ignores the possibility that Congleton knew that the people assigned to the project would not work well together.

Answer: The lawyer is attempting to argue that <fact8>Congleton did not want the project to fail</fact8> based on the fact that <fact5>she assigned top-notch individuals to it</fact5>, assuming that assigning the best people implies Congleton's intent for success. The other choices highlight flaws in this reasoning. For example, the lawyer fails to consider that Congleton may have been forced to <fact5>assign those individuals</fact5>, or that the witness could have misunderstood facts <fact7>rather than lied</fact7>. Additionally, the lawyer overlooks the possibility that Congleton knew the people might not work well together, which could also lead to failure. However, choice (c) correctly points out that the lawyer's reasoning is not flawed in assuming that failure could happen for reasons other than <fact8>Congleton’s intent</fact8>, such as poor teamwork or external circumstances. Therefore, the assumption that the project could fail only if <fact8>Congleton wanted it to fail </fact8>is not necessarily unreasonable. 
The answer is {C}.

Question: Editor Y: This is a good photograph: the composition is attractive, especially in the way the image is blurred by smoke in one corner. Editor Z: It' s very pretty, but it' s a bad photograph. It doesn' t make a statement; there' s no obvious reason for the smoke to be there. The editors' dialogue provides the most support for the claim that they disagree with each other about whether
Answer Choices:
(a) a photograph that is not attractive can still be a good photograph
(b) attractiveness by itself can make a photograph a good photograph
(c) a photograph's composition should be related to a statement that it makes
(d) a photograph that makes no statement can still be attractive
Reformatted Question: <fact1>Editor Y: This is a good photograph</fact1>: <fact2>the composition is attractive</fact2>, <fact3>especially in the way the image is blurred by smoke in one corner</fact3>. <fact4>Editor Z: It' s very pretty</fact4>, <fact5>but it' s a bad photograph</fact5>. <fact6>It doesn' t make a statement</fact6>; <fact7>there' s no obvious reason for the smoke to be there</fact7>. The editors' dialogue provides the most support for the claim that they disagree with each other about whether
Answer: Editor Y focuses on the <fact2>attractiveness and composition of the photograph</fact2>, praising how <fact3>the smoke contributes to its visual appeal</fact3>, which implies that Y considers attractiveness a key factor in determining whether a <fact1>photograph is good</fact1>. On the other hand, <fact4>Editor Z acknowledges that the photograph is "pretty" (attractive)</fact4> but <fact5>criticizes it as "bad"</fact5> because it <fact6>doesn't make a statement</fact6> or have a <fact7>clear reason for the smoke</fact7>. This shows that Editor Z believes attractiveness alone is not enough to make a photograph good while Editor Y thinks the opposite. 
The answer is {B}.
