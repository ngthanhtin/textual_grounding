Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: oven costume counterpart
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "oven": "o" (15). "costume": "c" (3). "counterpart": "c" (3). We now have: (3) ["costume" ? "counterpart"] < (15) "oven". Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "costume": "o" (15). "counterpart": "o" (15). We now have: (15) ["costume" ? "counterpart"]. Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their third letters.
The third letter: "costume": "s" (19). "counterpart": "u" (21). We now have: (19) "costume" < (21) "counterpart". Hence, we have ["costume" < "counterpart"] < "oven".
The answer is {costume counterpart oven}.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: hypochlorite ponderosa phone credulity
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "hypochlorite": "h" (8). "ponderosa": "p" (16). "phone": "p" (16). "credulity": "c" (3). We now have: (3) "credulity" < (8) "hypochlorite" < (16) ["ponderosa" ? "phone"]. Now let's sort this subpart ["ponderosa" ? "phone"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "ponderosa": "o" (15). "phone": "h" (8). We now have: (8) "phone" < (15) "ponderosa". Hence, we have "credulity" < "hypochlorite" < ["phone" <"ponderosa"].
The answer is {credulity hypochlorite phone ponderosa}.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: newt arson parthia seismography mugho aspect census
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "newt": "n" (14). "arson": "a" (1). "parthia": "p" (16). "seismography": "s" (19). "mugho": "m" (13). "aspect": "a" (1). "census": "c" (3). We now have: (1) ["arson" ? "aspect"] < (3) "census" < (13) "mugho" < (14) "newt" < (16) "parthia" < (19) "seismography". Now let's sort this subpart ["arson" ? "aspect"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "arson": "r" (18). "aspect": "s" (19). We now have: (18) "arson" < (19) "aspect". Hence, we have ["arson" < "aspect"] < "census" < "mugho" < "newt" < "parthia" < "seismography". 
The answer is {arson aspect census mugho newt parthia seismography}.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: sioux fortescue purloin percept helmsman
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "sioux": "s" (19), "fortescue": "f" (6), "purloin": "p" (16), "percept": "p" (16), "helmsman": "h" (8). Now we have: (6) "fortescue" < (8) "helmsman" < (16) ["purloin" ? "percept"] < (19) "sioux". Let's sort the subpart ["purloin" ? "percept"] by looking at their second letters: "purloin": "u" (21), "percept": "e" (5). We now have: (5) "percept" < (21) "purloin". Hence, the sorted list is: fortescue < helmsman < percept < purloin < sioux.
The answer is {fortescue helmsman percept purloin sioux}.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: skinny sharon sudan earthy parentage hello inmate announce co clayton carp phonetic watson nimbus
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "skinny": "s" (19), "sharon": "s" (19), "sudan": "s" (19), "earthy": "e" (5), "parentage": "p" (16), "hello": "h" (8), "inmate": "i" (9), "announce": "a" (1), "co": "c" (3), "clayton": "c" (3), "carp": "c" (3), "phonetic": "p" (16), "watson": "w" (23), "nimbus": "n" (14). Now we have: (1) "announce" < (3) ["carp" ? "clayton" ? "co"] < (5) "earthy" < (8) "hello" < (9) "inmate" < (14) "nimbus" < (16) ["parentage" ? "phonetic"] < (19) ["sharon" ? "skinny" ? "sudan"] < (23) "watson".
Let's break the subparts: ["carp" ? "clayton" ? "co"]: 
Second letter: "carp": "a" (1), "clayton": "l" (12), "co": "o" (15). Sorted: "carp" < "clayton" < "co". ["parentage" ? "phonetic"]:
Second letter: "parentage": "a" (1), "phonetic": "h" (8). Sorted: "parentage" < "phonetic". ["sharon" ? "skinny" ? "sudan"]:
Second letter: "sharon": "h" (8), "skinny": "k" (11), "sudan": "u" (21). Sorted: "sharon" < "skinny" < "sudan".
Hence, we have: announce < carp < clayton < co < earthy < hello < inmate < nimbus < parentage < phonetic < sharon < skinny < sudan < watson.
The answer is {announce carp clayton co earthy hello inmate nimbus parentage phonetic sharon skinny sudan watson}.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: tuba synapse inaudible brewster tithing
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "tuba": "t" (20), "synapse": "s" (19), "inaudible": "i" (9), "brewster": "b" (2), "tithing": "t" (20).
Now we have: (2) "brewster" < (9) "inaudible" < (19) "synapse" < (20) ["tithing" ? "tuba"].
Let's break the subpart ["tithing" ? "tuba"]:
Second letter: "tithing": "i" (9), "tuba": "u" (21). Sorted: "tithing" < "tuba".
Hence, we have: brewster < inaudible < synapse < tithing < tuba.
The answer is {brewster inaudible synapse tithing tuba}.
