Reformatted Question: We have three blocks, A, B, and C. <fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>. <fact2>Below block A is block B, which has one medium black square</fact2>. <fact3>To the left of block B, there is block C, which has two medium blue squares</fact3>. <fact4>Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two</fact4>. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? A medium blue square that is in block A or a medium blue square number two?
Answer: <fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block B (below A) has a black square</fact2>. <fact3>Block C, to the left of Block B, has two medium blue squares</fact3>, with <fact4>blue square number two on top and number one below it</fact4>. Since <fact3>the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B</fact3>, the object to the left of the black thing is medium blue square number two.
The answer is {B}.

Question: We have two blocks. Lets call them A and B. There are two small yellow triangles in block A. Small yellow triangle number one is above and near to small yellow triangle number two. To the right of block A there is block B which contains one small blue triangle. To the left of and far from a small blue circle is a big blue circle. It is above the small blue triangle. The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block. To the right of the small blue triangle is the small blue circle. Which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle? the small blue circle or the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block?
(a) the small blue circle
(b) the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block

The answer is {C}.

Question: There are three blocks. We call them A, B and C. Block A contains two big black circles. There is also a small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge of this block. Big black circle number two is touching the right edge of this block. Big black circle number one is to the left of and near to big black circle number two. This shape is above the small yellow triangle. Above block A is block B with a big black triangle in it. Above block B there is block C. It contains two big yellow triangles. Big yellow triangle number one is touching the right edge of this block. It is above big yellow triangle number two. What is above the big black triangle? a small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block or a big yellow triangle?
(a) small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block
(b) big yellow triangle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: <fact1>Block A contains a small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge</fact1>, and <fact2>Block C (above Block B) contains two big yellow triangles</fact2>, with <fact3>big yellow triangle number one above big yellow triangle number two</fact3>. Since <fact2>Block C is directly above Block B (which contains the big black triangle)</fact2>, the object above the big black triangle is a big yellow triangle.
The answer is {B}.

Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block B is below C. Block A is to the left of B. Block A contains a medium yellow triangle and a small yellow circle. The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and above the small yellow circle. Block B contains one small yellow triangle. And block C contains one medium yellow circle, one medium black circle and one small black circle. A medium blue circle is near to the small black circle. This object is near to and to the left of the medium yellow circle which is to the right of, near to and above the medium black circle. It is above the medium black circle. Which object is to the left of a small yellow triangle? the small yellow circle or the medium yellow circle?
(a) the small yellow circle
(b) the medium yellow circle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

A medium yellow circle or a medium yellow square?
Answer: <fact1>Block B contains the big blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block C, which is below Block A, contains both the medium yellow square and the medium yellow circle</fact2>. Since <fact3>the medium yellow circle is above the medium yellow square</fact3> and both are located in Block C, which is below Block A, neither of these objects is directly to the right of the big blue square in Block B.
The answer is {D}.
