Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block A has a medium blue square. Below block A is block B which has one medium black square. To the left of block B there is block C which has two medium blue squares. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? a medium blue square that is in block A or a medium blue square number two?\n0: medium blue square  that is in block A\n1: medium blue square  number two\n2: both of them\n3: none of them
Answer_Reasoning: Block A has a medium blue square, and Block B (below A) has a black square. Block C, to the left of Block B, has two medium blue squares, with blue square number two on top and number one below it. Since the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B, the correct answer is option 1.
