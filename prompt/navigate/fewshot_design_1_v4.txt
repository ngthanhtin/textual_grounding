Answer: You first take <fact1>9 steps</fact1> forward. Then, you turn left twice, making you face backward. Taking <fact2>5 steps</fact2> brings you back towards the starting point but not completely. After taking <fact3>4 more steps</fact3> and turning left twice again, you return to the same path and back to the starting point.
The answer is {yes}.

Answer: After taking <fact1>3 steps</fact1> forward, you turn left twice and then turn around, bringing you back to your original direction. You then take <fact2>5 steps</fact2> forward and turn around again, returning <fact3>5 steps</fact3>. However, this leaves you 3 steps away from the starting point.
The answer is {no}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 8 steps backward. Take 2 steps backward. Take 10 steps forward. Options: - Yes - No

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps left. Take 3 steps backward. Take 3 steps left. Options: - Yes - No
Reformatted Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take <fact1>6 steps left</fact1>. Take <fact2>3 steps backward</fact2>. Take <fact3>3 steps left</fact3>.
Answer: You first take <fact1>6 steps left</fact1>. Then, taking <fact2>3 steps backward</fact2> doesnâ€™t affect the horizontal position. After this, taking <fact3>3 more steps left</fact3> moves you further away from the starting point. Hence, you do not return to the starting point.
The answer is {no}.
