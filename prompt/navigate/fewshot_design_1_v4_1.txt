Answer: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) <fact1>Turn left</fact1>: (0, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) <fact2>Turn around</fact2>: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) <fact3>Turn left</fact3>: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) <fact4>Take 7 steps</fact4>: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) <fact5>Take 2 steps</fact5>: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) <fact6>Take 4 steps</fact6>: (0, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) <fact7>Take 8 steps</fact7>: (0, 21), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 21) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started.
The answer is {no}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn around. Take 6 
steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step. Options: - Yes - No

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) <fact1>Turn around</fact1>: We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis, and turning around changes our direction to face the negative y-axis.
(2) <fact2>Take 1 step</fact2>: Moving 1 step in the negative y-axis direction brings us to (0, -1).
(3) <fact3>Take 6 steps</fact3>: Taking 6 more steps moves us to (0, -7), still facing the negative y-axis.
(4) <fact4>Turn around</fact4>: Turning around again makes us face the positive y-axis.
(5) <fact5>Take 6 steps</fact5>: Moving 6 steps forward brings us back to (0, -1).
(6) <fact6>Take 9 steps</fact6>: Adding 9 steps in the positive y-axis direction brings us to (0, 8).
(7) <fact7>Take 1 step</fact7>: Finally, taking 1 more step places us at (0, 9).
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started.
The answer is {no}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. 
Take 7 steps right. Options: - Yes - No

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) <fact1>Always face forward</fact1>: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2)<fact2> Take 2 steps right</fact2>: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) <fact3>Take 9 steps left</fact3>: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) <fact4>Take 7 steps right</fact4>: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started.
The answer is {yes}.
