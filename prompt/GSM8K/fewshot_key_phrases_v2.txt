Question: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
every 12 cans [1]
you receive $0.50 [2]
every 5 kilograms of newspapers [3]

There are <s>[6] 20</s>/<s>[3] 5</s> = 4 sets of <s>[3] 5 kilograms of newspapers</s> that the family collected. So, the family would receive <s>[4] $1.50</s> x 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12. The answer is 12.

Question: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
invested $1000 [1]
yearly interest rate of 10% [2]
deposited an additional $100 every month [3]
two years [4]
Answer: For the first year, Joseph will have invested <s>[1] $1000</s> + (<s>[3] $100</s> * 12) = $2200. The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * <s>[2] 10%</s> = $220. The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $2420. For the <s>[4] second year</s>, the total invested will be $2420 + (<s>[3] $100</s> * 12) = $3620. The interest calculated after the <s>[4] second year</s> will be $3620 * <s>[2] 10%</s> = $362. Therefore, Joseph's investment in the hedge fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $3982. The answer is 3982.
