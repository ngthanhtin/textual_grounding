Question: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
Answer: There are 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $6 for the cans. There are 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected. So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12.
The answer is 12.

Question: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
Answer: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $2200. The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $220. The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $2420. For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $3620. The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $362. Therefore, Joseph's investment in the hedge fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $3982.
The answer is 3982.

Question: The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.
