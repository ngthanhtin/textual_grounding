Question: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
Answer_Reasoning: There are 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.\nSo, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = 6 for the cans.\nThere are 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.\nSo, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = 6 for the newspapers.\nTherefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = 12.
