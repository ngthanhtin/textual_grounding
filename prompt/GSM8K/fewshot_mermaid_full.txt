    A[Recycling Problem]
    A --> B[Cans]
    A --> C[Newspapers]
    A --> D[Family Collection]
    
    B --> B1[12 cans = $0.50]
    
    C --> C1[5 kg = $1.50]
    
    D --> D1[144 cans collected]
    D --> D2[20 kg newspapers collected]
Answer_Reasoning: There are <D1>144</D1>/<B1>12</B1> = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive <B1>$0.50</B1> * 12 = $6 for the cans. There are <D2>20 kilograms of newspapers</D2> that the family collected. So the family would receive <C1>$1.50</C1> * 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12. The answer is $12.

Question: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?

    B --> B1[Picked 16 strawberries]

    C --> C2[Picked twice as many as Natalie]
    E[Jam Making]
    E --> E1[1 jar uses 7 strawberries]
    E --> E2[1 jar sells for $4]
Answer_Reasoning: Matthew picked <B1>16</B1> + <A_C_C1>20</A_C_C1> = 36 strawberries. <C2>Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries </C2>. All together, they have <B1>16</B1> + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries. They can make <E1>70/7 = 10 jars of strawberries </E1>. They earn <E2>10 x $4</E2>= $40 from the strawberries they picked. The answer is $40.
Final_Answer: {40}
