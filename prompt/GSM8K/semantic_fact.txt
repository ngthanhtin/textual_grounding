Reformatted_Question: For every <number1>12 cans</number1> you recycle, you receive <number2>$0.50</number2>, and for every <number3>5 kilograms</number3> of newspapers, you receive <number4>$1.50</number4>. If your family collected <number5>144 cans</number5> and <number6>20 kilograms</number6> of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
