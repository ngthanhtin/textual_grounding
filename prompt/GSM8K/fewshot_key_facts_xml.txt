<key_facts>
<fact_1>every 12 cans you recycle</fact_1>
<fact_2>you receive $0.50</fact_2>
<fact_3>every 5 kilograms of newspapers</fact_3>
<fact_4>you receive $1.50</fact_4>
<fact_5>144 cans</fact_5>
<fact_6>20 kilograms of newspapers</fact_6>
</key_facts>
<answer_reasoning>
There are <fact_5>144</fact_5>/<fact_1>12</fact_1> = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive <fact_2>$0.50</fact_2> x 12 = $6 for the cans. There are <fact_6>20</fact_6>/5 = 4 sets of <fact_3>5 kilograms of newspapers</fact_3> that the family collected. So, the family would receive <fact_4> $1.50</fact_4> x 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12.

<question>
Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
</question>
<key_facts>
<fact_1>Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund</fact_1>
<fact_2>yearly interest rate of 10%</fact_2>
<fact_3>$100 every month</fact_3>
</key_facts>
<answer_reasoning>
For the first year, Joseph will have invested <fact_1>$1000</fact_1> + (<fact_3>$100</fact_3> * 12) = $2200. The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * <fact_2>10%</fact_2> = $220. The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $2420. For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + (<fact_3>$100</fact_3> * 12) = $3620. The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * <fact_2>10%</fact_2> = $362. Therefore, Joseph's investment in the hedge fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $3982.
