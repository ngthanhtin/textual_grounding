Reformatted Question: <a>Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund</a>. The fund promised a <c>yearly interest rate of 10%</c>. If he deposited an additional <b>$100 every month</b> into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
Answer: For the first year, Joseph will have invested <a>$1000</a> + (<b>$100</b> * 12) = $2200. The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * <c>10%</c> = $220. The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $2420. For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + (<b>$100</b> * 12) = $3620. The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * <c>10%</c> = $362. Therefore, Joseph's investment in the hedge fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $3982.
The answer is 3982.
