Reformatted Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: <fact1>a bus</fact1>, <fact2>a motorcycle</fact2>, <fact3>a hatchback</fact3>, <fact4>a station wagon</fact4>, <fact5>a minivan</fact5>, <fact6>a truck</fact6>, and <fact7>a limousine</fact7>. <fact8>The station wagon is the fourth-newest</fact8>. <fact9>The motorcycle is newer than the truck</fact9>. <fact10>The station wagon is older than the hatchback</fact10>. <fact11>The minivan is newer than the hatchback</fact11>. <fact12>The bus is newer than the minivan</fact12>. <fact13>The truck is newer than the limousine</fact13>.
Answer: To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts:
1. **<fact8>The station wagon is the fourth-newest</fact8>**: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon.
2. **<fact9>The motorcycle is newer than the truck</fact9>**: This indicates that the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age.
3. **<fact10>The station wagon is older than the hatchback</fact10>**: This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon.
4. **<fact11>The minivan is newer than the hatchback</fact11>**: This places the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age.
5. **<fact12>The bus is newer than the minivan</fact12>**: This means the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback.
6. **<fact13>The truck is newer than the limousine</fact13>**: This indicates that the limousine is older than the truck.
Now, let's summarize the order based on the information:
- Since the station wagon is the fourth-newest, we can denote the order as follows:
  - 1st: Bus (newest)
  - 2nd: Minivan (newer than hatchback)
  - 3rd: Motorcycle (newer than truck)
  - 4th: Station Wagon (given)
  - 5th: Hatchback (older than station wagon)
  - 6th: Truck (newer than limousine)
  - 7th: Limousine (oldest)
From this arrangement, we can see that the third-oldest vehicle is the **motorcycle**. 
The answer is {B}.

Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a hummingbird, a cardinal, a blue jay, an owl, a raven, a quail, and a robin. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The robin is to the left of the cardinal. The blue jay is the leftmost. The cardinal is the fourth from the left. The raven is the third from the right. The owl is the third from the left.
Options: (A) The hummingbird is the second from the right (B) The cardinal is the second from the right (C) The blue jay is the second from the right (D) The owl is the second from the right (E) The raven is the second from the right (F) The quail is the second from the right (G) The robin is the second from the right
Reformatted Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a hummingbird, a cardinal, a blue jay, an owl, a raven, a quail, and a robin. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The robin is to the left of the cardinal. The blue jay is the leftmost. <fact1>The cardinal is the fourth from the left</fact1>. The raven is the third from the right. The owl is the third from the left.
Answer: To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step:
1. **<fact10>The blue jay is the leftmost</fact10>**: This means the blue jay is in position 1.
2. **<fact11>The cardinal is the fourth from the left</fact11>**: Therefore, the cardinal is in position 4.
3. **<fact12>The raven is the third from the right</fact12>**: Since there are seven birds, the raven is in position 5 (7 - 3 + 1 = 5).
4. **<fact13>The owl is the third from the left</fact13>**: This places the owl in position 3.
5. **<fact8>The hummingbird is to the left of the quail</fact8>**: Since the hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, and the only remaining positions are 2 and 6, the hummingbird must be in position 2 and the quail in position 6.
6. **<fact9>The robin is to the left of the cardinal</fact9>**: The only remaining position for the robin is 7, which is to the left of the cardinal in position 4.
Now, we can summarize the positions:
1. Blue Jay
2. Hummingbird
3. Owl
4. Cardinal
5. Raven
6. Quail
7. Robin
Now, we can answer the question regarding which bird is the second from the right. The second from the right is position 2, which is occupied by the hummingbird.
The answer is {A}.

Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a robin, an owl, a quail, a falcon, a hummingbird, a cardinal, and a crow. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon. The crow is to the right of the cardinal. The cardinal is the second from the right. The quail is the third from the right. The falcon is to the left of the robin. The owl is the second from the left. Options: (A) The robin is the fourth from the left (B) The owl is the fourth from the left (C) The quail is the fourth from the left (D) The falcon is the fourth from the left (E) The hummingbird is the fourth from the left (F) The cardinal is the fourth from the left (G) The crow is the fourth from the left

Answer: To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step:
1. **<fact10>The cardinal is the second from the right</fact10>**: This means the cardinal is in position 6 (since there are 7 positions total).
2. **<fact11>The quail is the third from the right</fact11>**: Since the cardinal is in position 6, the quail must be in position 5.
3. **<fact9>The crow is to the right of the cardinal</fact9>**: Since the cardinal is in position 6, the crow must be in position 7.
4. **<fact13>The owl is the second from the left</fact13>**: This means the owl is in position 2.
5. **<fact8>The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon</fact8>**: The falcon must be in a position to the right of the hummingbird.
6. **<fact12>The falcon is to the left of the robin</fact12>**: This means the falcon must be in a position to the left of the robin.
Now, we can summarize the positions we have so far:
- Position 2: Owl
- Position 5: Quail
- Position 6: Cardinal
- Position 7: Crow
Since the owl is in position 2, the only available positions left for the hummingbird, falcon, and robin are 1, 3, and 4. 
Given that the falcon is to the left of the robin, the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:
- Position 1: Hummingbird
- Position 3: Falcon
- Position 4: Robin
Thus, the final arrangement from left to right is:
1. Hummingbird
2. Owl
3. Falcon
4. Robin
5. Quail
6. Cardinal
7. Crow
Now, we can answer the question:
- The robin is in position 4.
The answer is {A}.

Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eli, Eve, Mel, Joe, Mya, Rob, and Ada. Ada finished above Mya. Eli finished below Joe. Eli finished above Eve. Ada finished second-to-last. Mel finished third. Rob finished fourth. Options: (A) Eli finished third-to-last (B) Eve finished third-to-last (C) Mel finished third-to-last (D) Joe finished third-to-last (E) Mya finished third-to-last (F) Rob finished third-to-last (G) Ada finished third-to-last
Reformatted Question: In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eli, Eve, Mel, Joe, Mya, Rob, and Ada. <fact1>Ada finished above Mya</fact1>. <fact2>Eli finished below Joe</fact2>. <fact3>Eli finished above Eve</fact3>. <fact4>Ada finished second-to-last</fact4>. <fact5>Mel finished third</fact5>. <fact6>Rob finished fourth</fact6>. Options: (A) Eli finished third-to-last (B) Eve finished third-to-last (C) Mel finished third-to-last (D) Joe finished third-to-last (E) Mya finished third-to-last (F) Rob finished third-to-last (G) Ada finished third-to-last
Answer: Let's analyze the information step by step to determine the order of the golfers:
<fact4>Ada finished second-to-last (6th place)</fact4>.
<fact5>Mel finished third (3rd place)</fact5>.
<fact6>Rob finished fourth (4th place)</fact6>.
<fact1>Ada finished above Mya<fact1>, which means Mya must be in the last place (7th).
So there are still three places, 1st, 2nd, and 5th places. <fact2>Eli finished below Joe</fact2>, so Joe must have finished higher than Eli. <fact3>Eli finished above Eve</fact3>, placing Eve lower than Eli. So, Eve finished fifth (5rd place).
The answer is {B}.
