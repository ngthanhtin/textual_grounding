Question: Three friends (<fact1>Sarah</fact1>, <fact2>Jane</fact2>, and <fact3>Gina</fact3>) are employees of a company. Their respective salaries are in the ratio of <fact4>1 : 3 : 7</fact4>. <fact2>Jane</fact2> and <fact3>Gina</fact3>'s salaries together is Rs. <fact5>7000</fact5>. By what percent is <fact3>Gina's</fact3> salary higher than that of <fact1>Sarah</fact1>?
Answer Choices:
(a) 200%
(b) 600%
(c) 100%
(d) 300%
(e) 400%
Answer: Let the salaries be <fact6>x</fact6>, <fact7>3x</fact7>, and <fact8>7x</fact8> respectively.
Then, <fact7>3x + 7x = 7000</fact7> => <fact6>x = 700</fact6>.
<fact1>Sarah's</fact1> salary = Rs. <fact6>700</fact6>, <fact2>Jane's</fact2> salary = Rs. 2100, and <fact3>Gina's</fact3> salary = Rs. 4900.
Excess of <fact3>Gina's</fact3> salary over <fact1>Sarah's</fact1> = [ (4200 / 700) x 100 ] = <fact9>600%</fact9>.
The answer is: {B}.

Question: Once upon a time in ancient times there was a <fact1>king</fact1> who was very fond of wines. He had a huge cellar, which had <fact2>1000 different varieties of wine</fact2> all in different caskets (<fact2>1000 caskets</fact2> in all). In the adjoining kingdom, there was a <fact3>queen</fact3> who was envious of the <fact1>king's</fact1> huge wine collection. After some time when she could not bear it anymore, she conspired to kill him by poisoning all his wine caskets. She sent a sentry to poison all the caskets, but no sooner had the sentry poisoned only <fact4>one wine casket</fact4>, he was caught and killed by the Royal guards. Now the <fact1>king</fact1> had a major problem in his hand, so as to identify the <fact4>poisonous casket</fact4>, which he gave to the <fact5>Minister</fact5>. The situation had two peculiarities: 
I: Anyone who takes even one drop from the poisonous casket will die.
II: They will die only after one month.
The <fact1>king</fact1> also handed over a few <fact6>prisoners</fact6> to the <fact5>Minister</fact5> as “tasters” of those caskets, as their lives were of little value. If the <fact5>Minister</fact5> is allowed only 1 month to find out the poisonous casket, what is the minimum number of <fact6>prisoners</fact6> he should use as “tasters”?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1023
(b) 1024
(c) 1025
(d) 1026
(e) 1027

Answer: Study the following table carefully. Each of the <fact6>prisoners</fact6> drinks wine from whichever casket has a 1 in their place. If no one dies, <fact4>Casket 1</fact4> is poisoned.
If <fact7>P1 dies</fact7>, <fact4>casket 2</fact4> is poisoned.
If <fact7>P1</fact7> and <fact8>P3</fact8> die ⇒ <fact4>Casket 6</fact4> is poisoned, and so on.
So, if there are <fact9>3 prisoners</fact9>, we can differentiate up to 2³ = 8 caskets.
So for <fact2>1000 caskets</fact2> [even 1024 caskets], we need only <fact10>10 prisoners</fact10> as 2^10 = 1024.
The answer is {B}.

Question: McDonald's ran a campaign in which it gave game cards to its customers. These game cards made it possible for customers to win <fact1>hamburgers</fact1>, <fact2>French fries</fact2>, <fact3>soft drinks</fact3>, and other fast-food items, as well as <fact4>cash prizes</fact4>. Each card had <fact5>10 covered spots</fact5> that could be uncovered by rubbing them with a coin. Beneath <fact6>three of these spots</fact6> were "No Prize" signs. Beneath the other <fact7>seven spots</fact7> were names of prizes, two of which were identical.
For example, one card might have two pictures of a <fact1>hamburger</fact1>, one picture of a <fact3>Coke</fact3>, one of <fact2>French fries</fact2>, one of a <fact8>milk shake</fact8>, one of <fact9>5 Dollar</fact9>, one of <fact10>1000 Dollar</fact10>, and three "No Prize" signs. For this card, the customer could win a <fact1>hamburger</fact1>.
To win on any card, the customer had to uncover the two matching spots (which showed the potential prize for that card) before uncovering a "No Prize"; any card with a "No Prize" uncovered was automatically void. Assuming that the two matches and the three "No Prize" signs were arranged randomly on the cards, what is the probability of a customer winning?
Answer Choices:
(a) 0.1
(b) 0.15
(c) 0.12
(d) 0.18
(e) 0.13
Answer: As per the question, there are <fact5>10 cover spots</fact5>, out of which:
(i) <fact6>Three spots</fact6> are there with no prize (identical).
(ii) <fact11>Two spots of the same sign (Prize)</fact11>.
(iii) <fact12>Five other spots which are distinct</fact12>.

Total number of cases without restriction:
=> 10! / (3! × 2!).

Total number of favourable cases happen in the following ways:
CASE I: Second uncovering is <fact11>P</fact11>.
=> <fact11>P P</fact11> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ = 8C3 × 5! × 1.
CASE II:
=> _ _ <fact11>P</fact11> _ _ _ _ _ _ = 7C3 × 5! × 2.
CASE III:
=> 6C3 × 5! × 3.
CASE IV:
=> 5C3 × 5! × 4.
CASE V:
=> 4C3 × 5! × 5.
CASE VI:
=> 3C3 × 5! × 6.

Hence, the total number of favourable cases are:
=> case (I + II + III + IV + V + VI) / (10! / (3! × 2!)) = 0.10.
The answer is {A}.

Question: There is a <fact1>vertical stack of books marked 1, 2, and 3</fact1> on <fact2>Table-A</fact2>, with <fact3>1 at the bottom</fact3> and <fact4>3 on top</fact4>. These are to be placed vertically on <fact5>Table-B</fact5> with <fact3>1 at the bottom</fact3> and <fact6>2 on top</fact6>, by making a series of moves from one table to the other. During a move, the <fact7>topmost book, or the topmost two books, or all three</fact7>, can be moved from one of the tables to the other. If there are any books on the other table, the stack being transferred should be placed on top of the existing books, without changing the order of books in the stack that is being moved in that move. If there are no books on the other table, the stack is simply placed on the other table without disturbing the order of books in it. What is the minimum number of moves in which the above task can be accomplished?
Answer Choices:
(a) One
(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) Four
(e) None
Answer: 1: <fact8>2-3 moved to B</fact8>
2: <fact9>3 moved to A</fact9>,
3: <fact10>2 moved to A</fact10>,
4: <fact11>whole series shifted to B</fact11>.
Hence, the minimum number of moves is <fact12>4</fact12>.
The answer is {D}.

Question: A town consists of only one street in the form of a <fact1>circle</fact1>. The town authorities give out <fact2>four licenses</fact2> for a particular kind of business. The inhabitants of the town live in equal density along the <fact1>circle</fact1> and will always go to the closest business for what they need. Business <fact3>A</fact3> gets to choose a location first, then business <fact4>B</fact4>, then <fact5>C</fact5>, and finally <fact6>D</fact6>. Each business desires to carve out as much business for themselves as possible, but each knows the others all have the same motive. Assume that if a business is indifferent between locating in two different sections of the <fact1>circle</fact1>, it will choose a section at random. Also assume that the business that goes last will choose a location in the middle of the largest (or one of the largest) sections. Where should business <fact4>B</fact4> choose relative to the location of <fact3>A</fact3>?
Answer Choices:
(a) more then 1/3
(b) barely less then 1/3
(c) less then 2/3
(d) more then 2/3
(e) more then 3/3
Answer: The answer is just barely <fact7>less than 1/3</fact7> of the circumference of the <fact1>circle</fact1> away from <fact3>A</fact3>.
This is only a quick overview of the solution; the details are left up to you. Let the circumference of the <fact1>circle</fact1> be 1 and that <fact3>A</fact3> chooses a location at point 0.
<fact6>Business D</fact6> will choose a location in the middle of the largest section.
<fact5>Business C</fact5> will also choose the midpoint of the larger of the two gaps between the first two businesses.
If <fact4>B</fact4> chooses a point before 1/3, then <fact5>C</fact5> will choose a point halfway between <fact4>B</fact4> and 1. <fact6>Business D</fact6> will choose randomly between the halfway point between <fact3>A</fact3> and <fact5>C</fact5> or <fact4>B</fact4> and <fact5>C</fact5>.
If x is the location of <fact4>business B</fact4>, then the area which <fact4>B</fact4> will carve out of the <fact1>circle</fact1> will be either (1 + 3x)/8 if <fact6>D</fact6> goes between <fact4>B</fact4> and <fact5>C</fact5> or (1 + x)/4 if <fact6>D</fact6> goes between <fact3>A</fact3> and <fact5>C</fact5>. The average of these is (3 + 5x)/16. The same logic applies if <fact4>B</fact4> chooses a point after 2/3.
If <fact4>B</fact4> chooses a point after 1/3 (but before 1/2), then <fact5>C</fact5> will choose a point halfway between <fact3>A</fact3> and <fact4>B</fact4>, going the long way, and <fact6>D</fact6> will choose the halfway point between <fact3>A</fact3> and <fact4>B</fact4> the short way. This will leave <fact4>B</fact4> exactly a 1/4 share of the business.
If <fact4>B</fact4> should choose a location at exactly 1/3, then <fact5>C</fact5> would choose at 2/3, and <fact6>D</fact6> would be indifferent between 1/6, 1/2, and 5/6.
Thus, <fact4>B</fact4> should try to maximize (3 + 5x)/16 without choosing x equal or greater to 1/3. The optimal choice of location would be just a hair short of 1/3 (or just a hair after 2/3). At this point, <fact4>B</fact4> will have a 50/50 chance at having either 1/4 or 1/3 of the market share for an average of 7/24 =~ 0.29166667 of the market share.
The answer is {B}.

Question: A <fact1>fortune teller</fact1> has a unique way of predicting his customer’s prognosis. He has <fact2>three parrots</fact2> kept in three different <fact3>cages</fact3>. Each <fact3>cage</fact3> has <fact4>three cards</fact4> with a one-digit non-zero number inscribed on every card. No two cards have the same number, and no <fact3>cage</fact3> contains two cards with the number totaling ten. Further, the total of numbers on the three cards in the first <fact3>cage</fact3> is greater by two than that in the second and by four than that in the third. When a customer asks for his prognosis, the <fact1>fortune teller</fact1> lets out the <fact2>three parrots</fact2>, which randomly pick one card out of their respective <fact3>cages</fact3>. Before the prognosis is made, the <fact1>fortune teller</fact1> totals the numbers on the three cards picked out by the parrots and charges the customer the same number of rupees as the total of the numbers on the cards. One day, a customer paid <fact5>seven rupees</fact5> for his prognosis. Which of the following combinations of cards may be picked for prognosis?
Answer Choices:
(a) 5, 7, 8
(b) 7, 9, 4
(c) 2, 6, 3
(d) 1, 3, 8
(e) None of these
Answer: Considering the cages named as <fact6>A, B, and C</fact6>, according to the given condition, <fact7>A = B + 2</fact7> and <fact8>A = C + 4</fact8>.
The customer paid the amount as the sum of three cards, i.e., card A, card B, and card C = <fact5>7 rupees</fact5>.
So, <fact6>A + B + C = 7</fact6>, which gives us the equation:
<fact7>A + (A/2) + (A/4) = 7</fact7>.
Solving, we get <fact9>A = 4</fact9>.
Therefore, the values of <fact10>A, B, and C</fact10> are 4, 2, and 1, respectively.
The answer is {E}.

Question: <fact1>Amit</fact1>, <fact2>Sumit</fact2>, and <fact3>Pramit</fact3> go to a seaside town to spend a vacation there, and on the first day, everybody decides to visit different tourist locations. After breakfast, each of them boards a different tourist vehicle from the nearest bus depot. After three hours, <fact2>Sumit</fact2>, who had gone to a famous beach, calls on the mobile of <fact3>Pramit</fact3> and claims that he has observed a <fact4>shark</fact4> in the waters. <fact3>Pramit</fact3> learns from the local guide that at that time of the year, only <fact5>eight sea creatures (including a shark)</fact5> are observable, and the probability of observing any creature is equal. However, <fact1>Amit</fact1> and <fact3>Pramit</fact3> later recall during their discussion that <fact2>Sumit</fact2> has a reputation for not telling the truth five out of six times. What is the probability that <fact2>Sumit</fact2> actually observed a <fact4>shark</fact4> in the waters?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1/36
(b) 1/30
(c) 5/36
(d) 1/24
(e) 1/28
Answer: The probability that <fact2>Sumit</fact2> actually sees a <fact4>shark</fact4>, given that he claimed to have seen one:
=> P(<fact2>Sumit</fact2> actually sees the <fact4>shark</fact4> and reports the truth) / P(<fact2>Sumit</fact2> claims to have seen a <fact4>shark</fact4>).
=> P(Sees the shark)P(Reports truth) / (P(Sees a shark)P(Reports truth) + P(Doesn't see) P(Reports false)).
=> (1/8 × 1/6) / (1/8 × 1/6 + 7/8 × 5/6)
=> 1/36.
The answer is {A}.

Question: Seven movie addicts - <fact1>Guna</fact1>, <fact2>Isha</fact2>, <fact3>Leela</fact3>, <fact4>Madhu</fact4>, <fact5>Rinku</fact5>, <fact6>Viji</fact6>, and <fact7>Yamini</fact7> attend a film festival. Three films are shown, one directed by <fact8>Rajkumar Hirani</fact8>, one by <fact9>S. Shankar</fact9>, and one by <fact10>Mani Ratnam</fact10>. Each of the film buffs sees only one of the three films. The films are shown only once, one film at a time. The following restrictions must apply:
Exactly <fact11>twice as many</fact11> of the film buffs see the <fact9>S. Shankar</fact9> film as see the <fact8>Rajkumar Hirani</fact8> film.
<fact1>Guna</fact1> and <fact5>Rinku</fact5> do not see the same film as each other.
<fact2>Isha</fact2> and <fact4>Madhu</fact4> do not see the same film as each other.
<fact6>Viji</fact6> and <fact7>Yamini</fact7> see the same film as each other.
<fact3>Leela</fact3> sees the <fact9>S. Shankar</fact9> film.
<fact1>Guna</fact1> sees either the <fact8>Rajkumar Hirani</fact8> film or the <fact10>Mani Ratnam</fact10> film.
Answer Choices:
(a) A
(b) B
(c) C
(d) D
(e) NONE
Answer:
We will take the options and check them. Option A: <fact1>Guna</fact1> should not watch <fact9>S. Shankar's</fact9> film, so it is ruled out.

Option B:
<fact8>Rajkumar Hirani</fact8> - <fact9>S. Shankar</fact9> - <fact10>Mani Ratnam</fact10>
<fact2>Isha</fact2> - _ - <fact1>Guna</fact1>
<fact6>Viji</fact6> - _ - _
Now, <fact7>Yamini</fact7> should also watch <fact8>Rajkumar Hirani's</fact8> film, which is not possible.

Option C:
<fact8>Rajkumar Hirani</fact8> - <fact9>S. Shankar</fact9> - <fact10>Mani Ratnam</fact10>
<fact6>Viji</fact6> - <fact2>Isha</fact2> - <fact5>Rinku</fact5>
As <fact1>Guna</fact1> should not be watching <fact9>S. Shankar's</fact9> film, she should watch <fact10>Mani Ratnam's</fact10>, which is not possible.

Option D:
<fact8>Rajkumar Hirani</fact8> - <fact9>S. Shankar</fact9> - <fact10>Mani Ratnam</fact10>
<fact1>Guna</fact1> - <fact3>Leela</fact3> - <fact4>Madhu</fact4>
_ - <fact2>Isha</fact2> - <fact5>Rinku</fact5>
_ - _ - <fact6>Viji</fact6> and <fact7>Yamini</fact7>
The answer is {B}.
