Question: Three friends (Sarah, Jane and Gina) are employees of a company. Their respective salaries are in the ratio of 1 : 3 : 7. Jane and Gina's salaries together is Rs. 7000. By what percent is Gina's salary than that of Sarah?
Answer Choices:
(a) 200%
(b) 600%
(c) 100%
(d) 300%
(e) 400%
Answer: Let the salaries be x, 3x and 7x respectively. Then,3x + 7x = 7000 => x = 700. Sarah's salary = Rs. 700, Jane's salary = Rs. 2100, and Gina's salary Rs. 4900. Excess of Gina's salary over Sarah's=[ (4200 /700) x 100] = 600%. 
The answer is: {B}.

Question: Once upon a time in ancient times there was a king who was very found of wines. He had a huge cellar, which had 1000 different varieties of wine all in different caskets (1000 caskets in all). In the adjoining kingdom there was a queen who was envious of the king’s huge wine collection. After some time when she could not bear it any more show conspired to kill her by poisoning all his wine caskets. So she sent one sentry to poison all the caskets, but no sooner had the sentry poisoned only one wine casket, he was caught and killed by the Royal guards. Now the king had a major problem in his hand so as to identify the poisonous casket, which he gave to the Minister. But the situation had two peculiarities.
I: Any one who takes even one drop from the poisonous casket will die.
II: He will die only after one month.
The king also handed over few prisoners to the Minister as “taster” of those caskets, as their lives was of little value.
If the Minister is allowed only 1 month to find out the poisonous casket, what is the minimum number of prisoners he should use as “tasters”?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1023
(b) 1024
(c) 1025
(d) 1026
(e) 1027
Answer: Study the following table carefully. Each of the prisoners drinks wine from whichever casket has a 1 in his place. If he does not drink there is a 0.
So if no one dies, Casket 1 is poisoned.
If P1 dies, casket 2 is poisoned.
If P1 and P3 die ⇒⇒ casket 6 is poisoned and so on.
So, if there are 3 prisoners, we can differentiate upto 2323 =8 caskets.
So for 1000 caskets [even 1024 caskets], we need only 10 prisoners as 210210 = 1024
The answer is {B}.

Question: McDonald's ran a campaign in which it gave game cards to its customers. These game cards made it possible for customers to win hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, and other fast-food items, as well as cash prizes. Each card had 10 covered spots that could be uncovered by rubbing them with a coin. Beneath three of these spots were "No Prize" signs. Beneath the other seven spots were names of prizes, two of which were identical.
For example, one card might have two pictures of a hamburger, one picture of a Coke, one of French fires, one of a milk shake, one of 5 Dollar, one of 1000 Dollar and three "No Prize" signs. For this card the customer could win a hamburger.
To win on any card, the customers had to uncover the two matching spots (which showed the potential prize for that card) before uncovering a "No Prize"; any card with a "No Prize" uncovered was automatically void. Assuming that the two matches and the three "No Prize" signs were arranged randomly on the cards, what is the probability of a customer winning?
Answer Choices:
(a) 0.1
(b) 0.15
(c) 0.12
(d) 0.18
(e) 0.13
Answer: As per the question there are 10 cover spots out of which
(i) Three spots are there with no prize (identical)
(ii) Two spots of the same sign (Prize)
(iii) Five other spots which are distinct
Let three spots of no prize are (x,x,x), two spots of same sign are b(P,P) and five other spots are (A,B,C,D,E).
Total number of cases without restriction:
=>10!/(3!x2!).
Total number of favourable cases happen in the following ways which shows sequence of can covering are as follows:-
CASE I: Second uncovering is P
=>P P _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _=8C3×5!×1.
CASE II:
=>_ _ P _ _ _ _ _ _ =7C3×5!×2.
CASE III:
=>6C3×5!×3.
CASE IV:
=>5C3×5!×4.
CASE V:
=>4C3×5!×5.
CASE VI:
=>3C3×5!×6.
Hence, the total number of favourable cases are :-
=>case (I+II+III+IV+V+VI)/(10!3!X2!).
=>0.10.
The answer is {A}.

Question: There is a vertical stack of books marked 1, 2, and 3 on Table-A, with 1 at the bottom and 3 on top. These are to be placed vertically on Table-B with 1 at the bottom and 2 on the top, by making a series of moves from one table to the other. During a move, the topmost book, or the topmost two books, or all the three, can be moved from one of the tables to the other. If there are any books on the other table, the stack being transferred should be placed on top of the existing books, without changing the order of books in the stack that is being moved in that move. If there are no books on the other table, the stack is simply placed on the other table without disturbing the order of books in it. What is the minimum number of moves in which the above task can be accomplished?
Answer Choices:
(a) One
(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) Four
(e) None
Answer: 1:2-3 moved to B
2:3 moved to A,
3:2 moved to A,
4: whole series shifted to B.
Hence, minimum number of moves is 4 .
The answer is {D}.

Question: A town consists of only one street in the form of a circle. The town authorities give out four licenses for a particular kind of business. The inhabitants of the town live in equal density along the circle and will always go to the closest business for what they need. Business A gets to choose a location first, then business B, then C, and finally D. Each business desires to carve out as much business for themselves as possible but each knows the others all have the same motive. Assume that if a business is indifferent between locating in two different sections of the circle it will choose a section at random. Also assume that the business that goes last will choose a location in the middle of the largest (or one of the largest) sections. Where should business B choose relative to the location of A?
Answer Choices:
(a) more then 1/3
(b) barely less then 1/3
(c) less then 2/3
(d) more then 2/3
(e) more then 3/3
Answer: The answer is just barely less then 1/3 of the circumference of the circle away from A.
This is only a quick overview of the solution, the details are left up to you. Let the circumference of the circle be 1 and that A chooses a location at point 0. Business D will choose a location in the middle of the largest section.
Business C will also choose the midpoint of the larger of the two gaps between the first two businesses.
If business B chooses a point before 1/3 then C will choose a point halfway between B and 1. Business D will choose randomly between the halfway point between A and C or B and C. If x is the location of business B then the area which B will carve out of the circle will be either (1+3x)/8 if D goes between B and C or (1+x)/4 if D goes between A and C. The average of these is (3+5x)/16. The same logic applies if B chooses a point after 2/3.
If business B chooses a point after 1/3 (but before 1/2) then C will choose a point halfway between A and B going the long way and D will choose the halfway point between A and B the short way. This will leave B exactly a 1/4 share of the business. The same logic applies if A chooses a point between 1/2 and just before 2/3.
If B should choose a location at exactly 1/3 then C would choose at 2/3 and D would be indifferent between 1/6, 1/2, and 5/6. B would have a 2/3 chance of having 1/4 of the business share and 1/3 chance of having 1/3, the average being 5/18 =~ 0.27778 .
Thus B should try to maximize (3+5x)/16 without choosing x equal or greater to 1/3. The optimal choice of location would be just a hair short of 1/3 (or just a hair after 2/3). At this point B will have a 50/50 chance at having either 1/4 or 1/3 of the market share for an average of 7/24=~ 0.29166667 of the market share.
The answer is {B}.

Question: A fortune teller has a unique way of predicting his customer’s prognosis. He has three parrots kept in three different cages. Each cage has three cards with a one digit non-zero number inscribed on every card. No two cards have the same number and no cage contains two cards with the number totaling ten. Further the total of numbers on the three cards in the first cage is greater by two than that in the second and by four than that in the third. When a customer asks for his prognosis, the fortune teller lets out the three parrots, which randomly pick one card out of their respective cages. Before the prognosis is made, the fortune teller totals the numbers on the three cards picked out by the parrots and charges the customer the same number of rupees as the total of the numbers on the cards. One day a customer paid seven rupees for his prognosis.
Which of the following combinations of cards may be picked for prognosis?
Answer Choices:
(a) 5, 7, 8
(b) 7, 9, 4
(c) 2, 6, 3
(d) 1, 3, 8
(e) None of these
Answer: considering the cages named as A B and C
according to the given conditon A=2B and A=4C
the customer paid the amount as the sum of three cards ,i,e card A,card B and card C=7
A+B+C=7 so, A+(A/2)+(A/4)=7
Solving, we get A=4
therefore a,b,c=4,2,1
The answer is {E}.

Question: Amit, Sumit and Pramit go to a seaside town to spend a vacation there and on the first day everybody decides to visit different tourist locations. After breakfast, each of them boards a different tourist vehicle from the nearest bus-depot. After three hours, Sumit who had gone to a famous beach, calls on the mobile of Pramit and claims that he has observed a shark in the waters. Pramit learns from the local guide that at that time of the year, only eight sea-creatures (including a shark) are observable and the probability of observing any creature is equal. However, Amit and Pramit later recall during their discussion that Sumit has a reputation for not telling the truth five out of six times. What is the probability that Sumit actually observed a shark in the waters?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1/36
(b) 1/30
(c) 5/36
(d) 1/24
(e) 1/28
Answer: The probability that Sumit actually sees a Shark, given that he claimed to have seen one.
=>P(He actually sees the shark and reports truth) / P(He claims of seeing a shark).
=>P(Sees the shark)P(Reports Truth)/(P(He sees a shark)P(reports truth)+P(Doesn't see) P(reports false).
=>(1/8×1/6)/(1/8×1.6+7/8×5/6)
=>1/36.
The answer is {A}.
