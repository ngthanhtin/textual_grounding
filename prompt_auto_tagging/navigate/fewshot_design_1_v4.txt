Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take <fact1>1 step right</fact1>. Take <fact2>3 steps left</fact2>. Take <fact3>2 steps right</fact3>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: Starting from the original point, you first take <fact1>1 step right</fact1>. Then, you take <fact2>3 steps left</fact2>, which moves you 2 steps left from the starting point. Finally, taking <fact3>2 steps right</fact3> brings you to the starting point. Therefore, you return to the starting point. The answer is {yes}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take <fact1>1 step forward</fact1>. Take <fact2>10 steps left</fact2>. Take <fact3>4 steps forward</fact3>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: You take <fact1>1 step forward</fact1>, moving you 1 step ahead of the starting point. Then you take <fact2>10 steps left</fact2>, moving far to the left. Finally, taking <fact3>4 steps forward</fact3> moves you even further from the starting point. Hence, you do not return to the starting point. The answer is {no}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take <fact1>1 step</fact1>. Take <fact2>5 steps</fact2>. <fact3>Turn around</fact3>. <fact4>Turn around</fact4>. <fact5>Turn around</fact5>. Take <fact6>6 steps</fact6>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: You take a total of <fact1>6 steps forward</fact1>. Then, you <fact3>turn around three times</fact3>, leaving you facing backward. Taking <fact6>6 steps backward</fact6> after this returns you exactly to your starting point. The answer is {yes}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take <fact1>9 steps</fact1>. <fact2>Turn left</fact2>. <fact2>Turn left</fact2>. Take <fact3>5 steps</fact3>. Take <fact4>4 steps</fact4>. <fact2>Turn left</fact2>. <fact2>Turn left</fact2>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: You first take <fact1>9 steps</fact1> forward. Then, you <fact2>turn left</fact2> twice, making you face backward. Taking <fact3>5 steps</fact3> brings you back towards the starting point but not completely. After taking <fact4>4 more steps</fact4> and <fact2>turning left</fact2> twice again, you return to the same path and back to the starting point. The answer is {yes}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take <fact1>3 steps</fact1>. Turn <fact2>left</fact2>. Turn <fact3>left</fact3>. Turn <fact4>around</fact4>. Take <fact5>5 steps</fact5>. Turn <fact4>around</fact4>. Take <fact5>5 steps</fact5>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: After taking <fact1>3 steps</fact1> forward, you <fact2>turn left</fact2> twice and then <fact4>turn around</fact4>, bringing you back to your original direction. You then <fact5>take 5 steps</fact5> forward and <fact4>turn around</fact4> again, returning <fact5>5 steps</fact5>. However, this leaves you <fact1>3 steps</fact1> away from the starting point. The answer is {no}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take <fact1>8 steps backward</fact1>. Take <fact2>2 steps backward</fact2>. Take <fact3>10 steps forward</fact3>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: First, you take <fact1>8 steps backward</fact1>. Then you take an additional <fact2>2 steps backward</fact2>, moving you 10 steps away from the starting point. Finally, taking <fact3>10 steps forward</fact3> brings you back to the original point. The answer is {yes}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take <fact1>6 steps left</fact1>. Take <fact2>3 steps backward</fact2>. Take <fact3>3 steps left</fact3>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: You first take <fact1>6 steps left</fact1>. Then, taking <fact2>3 steps backward</fact2> doesnâ€™t affect the horizontal position. After this, taking <fact3>3 more steps left</fact3> moves you further away from the starting point. Hence, you do not return to the starting point. The answer is {no}.

Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take <fact1>7 steps</fact1>. Turn <fact2>around</fact2>. Take <fact3>7 steps</fact3>. Turn <fact4>left</fact4>. Turn <fact5>around</fact5>. Turn <fact6>around</fact6>. Turn <fact7>left</fact7>. Options: - Yes - No
Answer: You take <fact1>7 steps</fact1> forward. After <fact2>turning around</fact2> and taking <fact3>7 steps</fact3> back, you return to the starting point. <fact4>Turning left</fact4> twice more does not change your position, as it is purely a directional change. Therefore, you remain at the starting point. The answer is {yes}.
