Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. <fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>. <fact2>Below block A is block B</fact2> which has <fact3>one medium black square</fact3>. <fact4>To the left of block B there is block C</fact4> which has <fact5>two medium blue squares</fact5>. <fact6>Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two</fact6>. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. <fact7>What is to the left of the black thing</fact7>? <fact1>a medium blue square that is in block A</fact1> or <fact8>a medium blue square number two</fact8>? (a) medium blue square  that is in block A (b) medium blue square  number two (c) both of them (d) none of them
Answer: <fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block B (below A)</fact2> has <fact3>a black square</fact3>. <fact4>Block C, to the left of Block B</fact4>, has <fact5>two medium blue squares</fact5>, with <fact8>blue square number two</fact8> on top and <fact6>number one below it</fact6>. Since <fact4>the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B</fact4>. The answer is {B}.

Question: We have two blocks. Let's call them A and B. There are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1> in <fact2>block A</fact2>. Small yellow triangle number one is above and near to small yellow triangle number two. <fact3>To the right of block A there is block B</fact3> which contains <fact4>one small blue triangle</fact4>. To the left of and far from a small blue circle is a big blue circle. It is above the small blue triangle. The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block. To the right of the small blue triangle is the small blue circle. Which object is <fact5>to the right of a small yellow triangle</fact5>? the small blue circle or <fact4>the small blue triangle</fact4> that is touching the bottom edge of a block? (a) the small blue circle (b) the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block (c) both of them (d) none of them
Answer: In <fact2>block A</fact2>, there are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1>. <fact3>To the right of block A, block B</fact3> contains <fact4>a small blue triangle</fact4> touching the bottom edge and a small blue circle to its right. Since both the small blue circle and <fact4>the small blue triangle</fact4> are <fact5>to the right of the small yellow triangles</fact5>. The answer is {C}.

Question: There are three blocks. We call them A, B and C. <fact1>Block A</fact1> contains <fact2>two big black circles</fact2>. There is also a <fact3>small yellow triangle</fact3> touching the <fact4>bottom edge</fact4> of <fact1>this block</fact1>. <fact5>Big black circle number two</fact5> is touching the <fact6>right edge</fact6> of <fact1>this block</fact1>. <fact7>Big black circle number one</fact7> is to the left of and near to <fact5>big black circle number two</fact5>. <fact2>This shape</fact2> is above the <fact3>small yellow triangle</fact3>. <fact8>Above block A is block B</fact8> with a <fact9>big black triangle</fact9> in it. <fact10>Above block B</fact10> there is <fact11>block C</fact11>. <fact11>It</fact11> contains <fact12>two big yellow triangles</fact12>. <fact13>Big yellow triangle number one</fact13> is touching the <fact6>right edge</fact6> of <fact11>this block</fact11>. <fact13>It</fact13> is above <fact14>big yellow triangle number two</fact14>. What is <fact10>above the big black triangle</fact10>? a <fact3>small yellow triangle</fact3> which is touching the <fact4>bottom edge</fact4> of a block or a <fact15>big yellow triangle</fact15>? (a) <fact3>small yellow triangle</fact3> which is touching the <fact4>bottom edge</fact4> of a block (b) <fact15>big yellow triangle</fact15> (c) both of them (d) none of them
Answer: <fact1>Block A</fact1> contains a <fact3>small yellow triangle</fact3> touching the <fact4>bottom edge</fact4>, and <fact11>Block C</fact11> (<fact10>above Block B</fact10>) contains <fact12>two big yellow triangles</fact12>, with <fact13>big yellow triangle number one</fact13> above <fact14>big yellow triangle number two</fact14>. Since <fact11>Block C</fact11> is directly <fact10>above Block B</fact10> (which contains the <fact9>big black triangle</fact9>), the object <fact10>above the big black triangle</fact10> is a <fact15>big yellow triangle</fact15>. The answer is {B}.

Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. <fact1>Block B is below C</fact1>. <fact2>Block A is to the left of B</fact2>. <fact3>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle and a small yellow circle</fact3>. <fact4>The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and above the small yellow circle</fact4>. <fact5>Block B contains one small yellow triangle</fact5>. And block C contains one medium yellow circle, one medium black circle and one small black circle. A medium blue circle is near to the small black circle. This object is near to and to the left of the medium yellow circle which is to the right of, near to and above the medium black circle. It is above the medium black circle. Which object is to the left of <fact5>a small yellow triangle</fact5>? <fact3>the small yellow circle</fact3> or the medium yellow circle? (a) the small yellow circle (b) the medium yellow circle (c) both of them (d) none of them
Answer: <fact3>Block A contains a small yellow circle</fact3>, and <fact5>Block B contains a small yellow triangle</fact5>. Since <fact2>Block A is to the left of Block B</fact2>, and <fact3>the small yellow circle is in Block A</fact3>, it is to the left of the <fact5>small yellow triangle</fact5>. The medium yellow circle, which is in Block C, is above and to the right of the <fact5>small yellow triangle</fact5>, but not to the left of it. The answer is {A}.

Question: There are two blocks, A and B. <fact1>Block A has one big yellow triangle and a big black square</fact1>. <fact2>Below the big black square there is the big yellow triangle</fact2>. <fact3>It is touching the bottom edge of this block</fact3>. It also contains one small yellow square. <fact4>The big black square is to the left of and near to the small yellow square</fact4>. <fact5>Above block A we have block B which contains one big black triangle and a big black circle</fact5>. The big black triangle is near to the big black circle. What is <fact6>below the big black triangle</fact6>? a big black square or a circle? (a) big black square (b) circle (c) both of them (d) none of them
Answer: <fact5>Block A</fact5>, which is below Block B, contains a <fact1>big black square</fact1>. Since the <fact5>big black triangle is in Block B</fact5> and <fact5>Block A is directly below Block B</fact5>, the object directly <fact6>below the big black triangle</fact6> is the <fact1>big black square</fact1> in <fact5>Block A</fact5>. The answer is {A}.

Question: There are three blocks. Let's call them A, B, and C. <fact1>Block A</fact1> contains <fact2>a big blue circle</fact2> and <fact3>a medium black circle</fact3>. <fact4>The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge of this block</fact4>. <fact5>A big yellow circle is to the left of the medium black circle</fact5>. <fact6>The medium black circle is touching the right edge of this block</fact6>.  <fact7>To the left of the medium black circle there is the big blue circle</fact7>. It is below the yellow object which is to the left of the medium black circle. <fact8>To the left of block A we have block B with a big blue square in it</fact8>. <fact9>Below block A there is block C which has a medium yellow square</fact9>. This block also has <fact10>one medium yellow circle</fact10>. <fact11>Above the medium yellow square there is the medium yellow circle</fact11>. What is <fact12>to the right</fact12> of <fact13>the big blue square</fact13>? <fact10>a medium yellow circle</fact10> or <fact9>a medium yellow square</fact9>? (a) medium yellow circle (b) medium yellow square (c) both of them (d) none of them
Answer: <fact8>Block B</fact8> contains <fact13>the big blue square</fact13>, and Block C, which is below <fact1>Block A</fact1>, contains both <fact9>the medium yellow square</fact9> and <fact10>the medium yellow circle</fact10>. Since <fact10>the medium yellow circle</fact10> is <fact11>above the medium yellow square</fact11> and both are located in Block C, which is <fact9>below Block A</fact9>, <fact12>neither</fact12> of these objects is directly to the right of <fact13>the big blue square</fact13> in <fact8>Block B</fact8>. The answer is {D}.
