Answer: <fact2>Paganism</fact2> often involves magic and nature worship.  The magic practiced in <fact1>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</fact1> is a core element of the world. Characters interact with magical creatures and perform spells. Some might consider this similar to <fact2>pagan</fact2> practices. However, the characters are not explicitly identified as <fact2>pagans</fact2>, and the wizarding world exists alongside the ""Muggle"" world, which is largely Christian. While the magical elements might be seen as ""pagan"" by some, there isn't a clear persecution of wizards *because* they're <fact2>pagan</fact2> within the context of the book.

While <fact3>SSRIs</fact3> can be effective in treating <fact2>depression</fact2> in these age groups, they require careful monitoring. The increased risk does not necessarily make them categorically ""less <fact4>safe</fact4>"" for <fact1>younger individuals</fact1> compared to <fact5>older adults</fact5>, but it does highlight the need for increased vigilance and a different risk/benefit assessment than when prescribing to <fact5>adults</fact5>.  So, while they are not strictly less safe in terms of other side effects, the increased risk of suicidality in <fact1>younger patients</fact1> requires considering them differently in terms of <fact4>safety</fact4>.  The answer is {true}.

The framers of the Constitution largely viewed <fact3>Black Americans</fact3> as property, not as individuals with the same rights as white Americans. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the <fact1>Second Amendment</fact1> was written without consideration for the rights of <fact3>Black Americans</fact3>.
"
41,Are all the elements plants need for photosynthesis present in atmosphere of Mars?,"Reformatted Question: Are all the elements plants need for <fact1>photosynthesis</fact1> present in <fact2>atmosphere of Mars</fact2>?

Answer: There are 52 or 53 <fact1>Wednesdays</fact1> in a year.  The <fact2>Bible</fact2> has approximately 783,137 words.  A fast reader can read about 300 words per minute. This means it would take about 2610 minutes or 43.5 hours to read the <fact2>Bible</fact2> once. To read it <fact3>15 times</fact3>, it would take 652.5 hours.  Even if there were 53 <fact1>Wednesdays</fact1>, that would only provide 1274 hours if someone spent all 24 hours of each Wednesday reading.

Answer:  This question is unclear.  It's asking if $1000 per episode of <fact2>Days of our Lives</fact2> is *preferred*. Preferred by whom? Actors?  The network? Viewers? 

If the question is about whether <fact1>$1000</fact1> is a typical or high payment *per episode* for soap opera actors, that requires information about soap opera actor salaries, which isn't provided.  If it's asking whether <fact1>$1000</fact1> per episode is a reasonable production cost for <fact2>Days of Our Lives</fact2> compared to <fact3>other soaps</fact3>, that requires budget information.

Answer: The cost of <fact3>a new iPhone 11</fact3> varies depending on the model and storage capacity but generally starts around $700-$800. The cost to <fact2>run for President of India</fact2> involves a nomination fee (₹15,000, or approximately US$180) and campaign expenses, which can vary widely. While the nomination fee itself is less than the cost of <fact3>an iPhone 11</fact3>, the overall campaign expenses are likely much greater.

Answer: The <fact1>Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882</fact1> was a <fact3>federal law</fact3> in the <fact4>US</fact4> that prohibited all immigration of <fact1>Chinese laborers</fact1>. This act represents <fact2>discrimination</fact2> based on ethnicity.  While this law has been repealed, the fact that it existed as <fact3>federal legislation</fact3> demonstrates that <fact1>Chinese Americans</fact1> have historically faced <fact2>discrimination</fact2> at the <fact3>federal level</fact3> in the <fact4>US</fact4>.

Answer: <fact1>Hawaiian cuisine</fact1> includes dishes like poi, which is made from fermented taro root, and lomi salmon, which is raw salmon cured in salt, onions, and tomatoes.  While these dishes may be considered <fact2>unappetizing</fact2> or <fact2>unusual</fact2> to some in the <fact3>continental United States</fact3> due to differing cultural norms around food, ""gross"" is subjective.  Therefore, whether or not <fact1>Hawaiian cuisine</fact1> embraces foods considered <fact2>gross</fact2> depends on individual palates and perspectives.  More information is needed to definitively say if these foods are widely considered <fact2>gross</fact2> in the <fact3>continental US</fact3>. So the answer is {uncertain}.

A <fact2>cast</fact2> is a shell, frequently made of plaster or fiberglass, encasing a limb (or, in some cases, large portions of the body) to stabilize and hold anatomical parts, most often a broken bone (or bones), in place until healing is confirmed. Since <fact1>dementia</fact1> is a neurological condition and a <fact2>cast</fact2> is used to treat broken bones, a <fact2>cast</fact2> will not cure <fact1>dementia</fact1>.  So the answer is {false}.

Answer: <fact2>Chlorine gas</fact2> is greenish-yellow in color.  <fact3>Neon gas</fact3>, on the other hand, is colorless unless electrically charged, at which point it glows a bright reddish-orange. A <fact1>dichromat</fact1> has difficulty distinguishing shades of red and green. However, the difference between the greenish-yellow of <fact2>chlorine gas</fact2> and the (lack of color or bright reddish-orange if charged) of <fact3>neon gas</fact3> is substantial enough that even a <fact1>dichromat</fact1> could likely distinguish them.

Answer: <fact1>Quiet</fact1> is a fictional character from the video game, <fact2>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</fact2>.  <fact1>She</fact1> primarily communicates non-verbally, and her backstory involves being subjected to experiments that altered her physiology, making <fact1>her</fact1> require <fact1>her</fact1> skin to absorb water and nutrients. This would make traditional lecturing difficult. <fact3>Haub School of Business</fact3> at Saint Joseph's University focuses on business education, which requires clear communication and instruction.  Therefore, <fact1>Quiet's</fact1> limitations would make <fact1>her</fact1> a poor choice for a lecturer at <fact3>Haub</fact3>.  So the answer is {true}.

1173,Is Dungeons and Dragons a game well suited for solo play?,"Reformatted Question: Is <fact1>Dungeons and Dragons</fact1> a game well suited for <fact2>solo play</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>Dungeons and Dragons</fact1> is traditionally played as a group, with one person acting as the Dungeon Master (DM) and others playing as player characters (PCs).  The DM creates the story and world, while the PCs interact with it.  This social, collaborative aspect is central to the traditional <fact1>D&D</fact1> experience. While there are ways to adapt <fact1>D&D</fact1> for <fact2>solo play</fact2>, such as using solo adventures or playing all the characters oneself, it loses the core dynamic of group storytelling and shared experience.

Answer: <fact1>Common warthogs</fact1> are omnivores and eat grasses, roots, berries, bark, insects, eggs, and occasionally carrion.  A <fact2>greenhouse</fact2> typically contains plants, some of which a <fact1>warthog</fact1> would eat.  However, a <fact2>greenhouse</fact2> would be unlikely to contain a sufficient quantity or variety of food for a <fact1>warthog</fact1> to thrive long-term, leading to eventual starvation.

Answer: <fact1>Bern</fact1> is the capital of Switzerland and has a diverse population. A <fact2>xenophobic</fact2> person, by definition, has a fear or hatred of anything perceived as foreign or strange.  Because <fact1>Bern</fact1> has a diverse population, a <fact2>xenophobic person</fact2> may find it difficult or uncomfortable to live there. Therefore, <fact1>Bern</fact1> would be a poor choice for a <fact2>xenophobic Swiss citizen</fact2>. So the answer is {true}.
"
1234,Are there tearjerkers about United Airlines flights?,"Reformatted Question: Are there tearjerkers about <fact1>United Airlines</fact1> <fact2>flights</fact2>?
Answer: While there aren't widely known tearjerker movies specifically *about* <fact1>United Airlines</fact1> <fact2>flights</fact2>, there are films featuring emotional or tragic scenes involving air travel, some of which might involve <fact1>United</fact1> (or other airlines) in a fictionalized way.  For instance, the movie ""United 93"" depicts the events of <fact2>flight</fact2> 93 on 9/11, which was a <fact1>United Airlines flight</fact1>, and is certainly a tearjerker. Additionally, many disaster movies involving planes might feature fictionalized airlines that share similarities with real ones like <fact1>United</fact1>. So while a dedicated tearjerker specifically about a regular <fact1>United Airlines</fact1> <fact2>flight</fact2> is unlikely, related films featuring emotional or tragic plane journeys certainly exist.

Answer: <fact2>Snowdon</fact2> receives about <fact1>5000 mm of rainfall per year</fact1>.  An <fact3>upright bowling pin</fact3> is roughly 38 cm (380 mm) tall. Since 5000 mm is significantly greater than 380 mm, the <fact1>yearly precipitation</fact1> would indeed submerge the <fact3>bowling pin</fact3>. So the answer is {true}.

Answer: While some <fact1>Republicans</fact1> advocate for reduced government spending and stricter eligibility requirements for welfare programs, the party platform does not explicitly reject <fact2>all forms of welfare</fact2>.  Many <fact1>Republicans</fact1> support certain welfare programs, particularly those focused on temporary assistance or those that they view as encouraging work, while opposing others they see as creating dependency on government.

Answer: <fact1>Alexander Hamilton</fact1> died in 1804. <fact2>Koalas</fact2> were first scientifically described in 1798.  Since <fact2>koalas</fact2> were described before <fact1>Alexander Hamilton</fact1>'s death, it is possible he could have known about them. However, information traveled slowly in those days and <fact2>koalas</fact2> are native to Australia, a faraway place from the United States where <fact1>Hamilton</fact1> lived.  So the answer is likely {false}, but not definitively.

Answer: <fact1>Goofy</fact1> is a cartoon character, and cartoon characters don't age in a realistic way.  Even if we assumed <fact1>Goofy</fact1> aged like a human, Pluto was considered a planet until 2006.

Answer:  Mongooses typically inhabit a variety of environments, including grasslands, forests, and scrublands, not specifically <fact2>deserts</fact2>. Their coloration varies depending on the species, but generally provides camouflage for their usual habitats.  A <fact1>mongoose's</fact1> coat would likely offer limited camouflage in a <fact2>desert</fact2> environment given the typical coloration of mongooses does not match the sandy or rocky tones of most deserts.

1427,Will twenty pea pods contents cover entire chess board?,"Reformatted Question: Will <fact1>twenty pea pods</fact1> contents cover <fact2>entire chess board</fact2>?
Answer: A standard <fact2>chessboard</fact2> has 64 squares.  <fact1>Pea pods</fact1> typically contain between 5-10 peas each.  Even if each of the <fact1>twenty pea pods</fact1> contained the maximum of 10 peas, that would only be 200 peas (20 pods * 10 peas/pod). Since 200 is less than 64, the answer is {false}.

1429,Can the Supreme Court of Canada fight a Lucha trios match?,"Reformatted Question: Can the <fact1>Supreme Court of Canada</fact1> fight a <fact2>Lucha trios match</fact2>?
Answer: The <fact1>Supreme Court of Canada</fact1> is composed of nine judges. A <fact2>Lucha trios match</fact2> requires three wrestlers per team.  While theoretically, three teams of three judges *could* be formed from the nine justices, the <fact1>Supreme Court of Canada's</fact1> function is to interpret and apply the law, not to participate in professional wrestling.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the <fact1>Supreme Court of Canada</fact1> would engage in a <fact2>Lucha trios match</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1430,Could the Atlantic readers fill 500 battalions?,"Reformatted Question: Could the <fact1>Atlantic readers</fact1> fill <fact2>500 battalions</fact2>?

1439,Does Hammurabi's Code violate Christians Golden Rule?,"Reformatted Question: Does <fact1>Hammurabi's Code</fact1> violate the <fact2>Christian Golden Rule</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>Hammurabi's Code</fact1> is based on the principle of ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" (lex talionis). The <fact2>Christian Golden Rule</fact2> states, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""  Since <fact1>Hammurabi's Code</fact1> focuses on retribution and the <fact2>Golden Rule</fact2> focuses on compassion and forgiveness, they are often at odds. Many interpretations of <fact1>Hammurabi’s Code</fact1> see it as promoting cycles of violence, while the <fact2>Golden Rule</fact2> seeks to break such cycles.  Therefore, it can be argued that <fact1>Hammurabi's Code</fact1> does violate the <fact2>Christian Golden Rule</fact2>.

Answer: The <fact1>Ten Commandments</fact1> are a fundamental part of <fact2>Jewish</fact2> tradition and belief. They are central to the Torah, which is the foundation of Judaism. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that <fact2>Jewish people</fact2> do <fact3>not</fact3> believe in the <fact1>Ten Commandments</fact1>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1442,Can you conduct surveillance from a teddy bear?,"Reformatted Question: Can you conduct surveillance from a <fact1>teddy bear</fact1>?

1443,Would a retail associate envy the retailer's CEO's pay?,"Reformatted Question: Would a <fact1>retail associate</fact1> envy the <fact2>retailer's CEO's</fact2> <fact3>pay</fact3>?
Answer: A <fact1>retail associate</fact1> generally earns minimum wage or slightly above. <fact2>A CEO</fact2> of a retail company will earn a considerably higher <fact3>salary</fact3>.  The disparity in <fact3>pay</fact3> between a low-level employee like a <fact1>retail associate</fact1> and the <fact2>CEO</fact2> is often substantial. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a <fact1>retail associate</fact1> might envy the <fact2>CEO's</fact2> significantly higher <fact3>pay</fact3>. So the answer is {true}.
"
1444,Can Tame Impala's studio band play a proper game of Hot Potato?,"Reformatted Question: Can <fact1>Tame Impala's studio band</fact1> play a proper game of <fact2>Hot Potato</fact2>?
Answer: <fact2>Hot Potato</fact2> requires at least two people.  <fact1>Tame Impala's studio band</fact1> is primarily Kevin Parker, who multi-instruments. While he could theoretically toss a potato to himself, that wouldn't be a proper game of <fact2>Hot Potato</fact2>.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.
"
1445,Is it bad to have lactic acid in your body?,"Reformatted Question: Is it <fact1>bad</fact1> to have <fact2>lactic acid</fact2> in your <fact3>body</fact3>?
Answer: <fact2>Lactic acid</fact2> is a natural byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, the process your <fact3>body</fact3> uses to produce energy when oxygen is low.  While excessive buildup of <fact2>lactic acid</fact2> can cause discomfort (muscle soreness, burning sensation), it's not inherently <fact1>bad</fact1>. In fact, <fact2>lactic acid</fact2> is quickly cleared from the <fact3>body</fact3> and can even be used as a fuel source.  So, having some <fact2>lactic acid</fact2> is normal and not necessarily <fact1>bad</fact1>.  However, consistently high levels may indicate an underlying issue.
"
1446,Will Tokyo Tower be repainted only once during President Trump's first term?,"Reformatted Question: Will <fact1>Tokyo Tower</fact1> be repainted <fact2>only once</fact2> during <fact3>President Trump's first term</fact3>?
Answer: <fact3>President Trump's first term</fact3> lasted from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. <fact1>Tokyo Tower</fact1> is repainted every five years.  The last repainting before <fact3>Trump's term</fact3> began was in 2014.  Therefore, <fact1>Tokyo Tower</fact1> would have been repainted in 2019, during <fact3>Trump's first term</fact3>.  Since 2019 falls within <fact3>Trump's first term</fact3> and another repainting would not have been due until 2024, <fact1>Tokyo Tower</fact1> would have been repainted <fact2>only once</fact2> during this period. So the answer is {true}.
"
1447,Would the crew of Apollo 15 have difficulty riding a unicycle?,"Reformatted Question: Would the <fact1>crew of Apollo 15</fact1> have <fact2>difficulty</fact2> riding a <fact3>unicycle</fact3>?
Answer: Riding a <fact3>unicycle</fact3> requires balance and coordination. The <fact1>crew of Apollo 15</fact1> were astronauts, trained for space travel.  While their training might have involved some balance exercises, it's unlikely they were specifically trained for <fact3>unicycle riding</fact3>.  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they would have some <fact2>difficulty</fact2>. So the answer is {true}.
"

Answer: An <fact3>oath</fact3> in a <fact4>court of law</fact4> is a sworn statement to tell the truth. <fact2>Lying</fact2> under <fact3>oath</fact3> is considered perjury. Perjury is a crime. Because it is a crime, it is not <fact1>okay</fact1>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1449,Is Newspeak considered very straightforward?,"Reformatted Question: Is <fact1>Newspeak</fact1> considered very <fact2>straightforward</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>Newspeak</fact1>, the language of Oceania in George Orwell's *1984*, is designed to limit thought by reducing vocabulary.  Its purpose is to make thoughtcrime impossible by eliminating words that could express rebellious or unorthodox ideas.  Therefore, while the vocabulary itself might be simpler, the implications and ultimate goal of <fact1>Newspeak</fact1> are anything but <fact2>straightforward</fact2>. The answer is {false}.
"
1450,Do Snow White dwarves best The Hobbit dwarves in battle?,"Reformatted Question: Do <fact1>Snow White dwarves</fact1> best <fact2>The Hobbit dwarves</fact2> in <fact3>battle</fact3>?
Answer: The <fact1>seven dwarves of Snow White</fact1> are miners, and not fighters.  The <fact2>dwarves of The Hobbit</fact2> are warriors with experience in <fact3>battle</fact3>. Therefore, the <fact2>dwarves of The Hobbit</fact2> would likely best the <fact1>dwarves of Snow White</fact1> in <fact3>battle</fact3>. So the answer is {false}.
"

Answer: The <fact3>Lighthouse of Alexandria</fact3> no longer exists.  Therefore, it is impossible to determine its levelness relative to anything. Since the question asks if the <fact1>Statue of Unity</fact1> is *more* level with the <fact2>Statue of Liberty</fact2> than the <fact3>Lighthouse of Alexandria</fact3>, and we can't assess the <fact3>Lighthouse of Alexandria's</fact3> level, the answer is {false}.

Answer: <fact1>Lhamo Thondup</fact1> is the birth name of the 14th Dalai Lama, a highly revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism.  <fact3>Sainthood</fact3> is a designation specific to the <fact2>Catholic Church</fact2>, recognizing individuals for their exceptional holiness and virtue.  As the Dalai Lama is not a member of the Catholic faith, he would not be eligible for consideration as a <fact3>saint</fact3> by the <fact2>Catholic Church</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1456,Can children be hurt by jalapeno peppers?,"Reformatted Question: Can <fact1>children</fact1> be hurt by <fact2>jalapeno peppers</fact2>?
Answer: <fact2>Jalapeno peppers</fact2> contain capsaicin, which causes a burning sensation when it comes into contact with skin or mucous membranes.  <fact1>Children</fact1> often have more sensitive skin than adults, so they are likely to experience more discomfort from the capsaicin in <fact2>jalapeno peppers</fact2>.  Therefore, yes, <fact1>children</fact1> can be hurt by <fact2>jalapeno peppers</fact2>.
"

Answer: While <fact2>Washington, D.C.</fact2> is on the water, it's brackish water, not the preferred saltwater habitat of <fact1>harbor seals</fact1>. They are occasionally spotted in the area but not a regular occurrence.  So the answer is {false}.
"
1459,Would 2020 Toyota Supra lag behind at a Nascar rally?,"Reformatted Question: Would a <fact1>2020 Toyota Supra</fact1> lag behind at a <fact2>Nascar rally</fact2>?
Answer: <fact2>Nascar vehicles</fact2> are specifically designed for racing and reach speeds of over 200 mph. A <fact1>2020 Toyota Supra</fact1>, while a sports car, is not designed for professional racing and has a much lower top speed.  Therefore, a <fact1>Supra</fact1> would likely lag behind at a <fact2>Nascar rally</fact2>. So the answer is {true}.
"
1460,Can a human eat an entire 12-lb roast turkey in an hour?,"Reformatted Question: Can a <fact1>human</fact1> eat an entire <fact2>12-lb roast turkey</fact2> in <fact3>an hour</fact3>?
Answer: Competitive eaters can consume large amounts of food quickly. However, <fact2>12 lbs of roast turkey</fact2> is a substantial amount of food.  Even for professional eaters, consuming that quantity in <fact3>an hour</fact3> is highly unlikely.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.

Answer: The <fact1>Viper Room</fact1> is a nightclub in Los Angeles, California.  The <fact2>National Diet Building</fact2> is located in Tokyo, Japan and houses the National Diet of Japan (their legislature).  A concert venue like the <fact1>Viper Room</fact1> could not realistically hold a concert in the <fact2>National Diet Building</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.

Answer: <fact1>Vegans</fact1> do not consume any animal products. <fact3>Tuna</fact3> is a fish. <fact2>Chickpeas</fact2> are a legume.  Therefore, <fact2>chickpeas</fact2> would be an acceptable <fact3>substitute</fact3> for <fact1>vegans</fact1>. So the answer is {true}.
"
1464,Were Beauty and the Beast adaptations devoid of Kurt Sutter collaborators?,"Reformatted Question: Were <fact1>Beauty and the Beast adaptations</fact1> devoid of <fact2>Kurt Sutter collaborators</fact2>?
Answer: <fact2>Kurt Sutter</fact2> is known for his work on gritty television series like Sons of Anarchy and The Shield. <fact1>Beauty and the Beast adaptations</fact1> tend to be family-friendly romantic fantasies.  These genres don't seem to overlap, making it unlikely <fact2>Sutter's collaborators</fact2> would be involved in <fact1>Beauty and the Beast adaptations</fact1>. So the answer is likely {true}, though further research into specific adaptations and their crews would be needed for absolute certainty.
"
1465,Would Swiss Guard defeat the Marines?,"Reformatted Question: Would <fact1>Swiss Guard</fact1> defeat the <fact2>Marines</fact2>?
Answer: The <fact1>Swiss Guard</fact1> are a small force of around 135 soldiers responsible for the Pope's safety and the security of the Vatican.  The <fact2>United States Marine Corps</fact2> is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces with hundreds of thousands of active and reserve personnel, significantly greater firepower, and extensive training for modern warfare.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the <fact1>Swiss Guard</fact1> could defeat the <fact2>Marines</fact2> in any realistic combat scenario. So the answer is {false}.
"

Answer: <fact1>Edward II</fact1> was born in 1284. The <fact2>Battle of Falkirk</fact2> took place in 1298.  <fact1>Edward II</fact1> would have been 14 years old at the time of the <fact2>battle</fact2>.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely he played a crucial role. So the answer is {false}.
"
1468,Was Emperor Commodus paid tribute in Pound sterling?,"Reformatted Question: Was <fact1>Emperor Commodus</fact1> paid tribute in <fact2>Pound sterling</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>Emperor Commodus</fact1> ruled from 177 to 192 AD. The <fact2>Pound sterling</fact2> was introduced around 775 AD.  Since <fact2>the Pound sterling</fact2> didn't exist during <fact1>Emperor Commodus's</fact1> reign, the answer is {false}.
"
1469,Should spaghetti be slick when cooked?,"Reformatted Question: Should <fact1>spaghetti</fact1> be <fact2>slick</fact2> when <fact3>cooked</fact3>?
Answer: <fact1>Spaghetti</fact1>, when properly <fact3>cooked</fact3>, should be al dente, meaning ""to the tooth"" in Italian.  This texture is firm but not hard. Overcooked <fact1>spaghetti</fact1> becomes mushy, while undercooked <fact1>spaghetti</fact1> is too firm.  Neither of these states is considered <fact2>slick</fact2>. Properly <fact3>cooked</fact3> <fact1>spaghetti</fact1> can have a slight, natural slipperiness due to the starches released during cooking, but it shouldn't be excessively <fact2>slick</fact2>. Excessive slickness could indicate overcooking or the addition of too much oil or fat to the cooking water. Therefore, while not completely dry, <fact1>spaghetti</fact1> should not be described as <fact2>slick</fact2> when properly <fact3>cooked</fact3>. So the answer is {false}.
"

Answer: The <fact1>Carnation Revolution</fact1> was a largely bloodless coup in Portugal in 1974.  The <fact2>deadliest revolutions in Europe</fact2> would include events like the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution, and various other uprisings which resulted in significantly more deaths than the <fact1>Carnation Revolution</fact1>.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.
"
1471,Would hypothermia be a concern for a human wearing zoot suit on Triton?,"Reformatted Question: Would <fact1>hypothermia</fact1> be a concern for a human wearing a <fact2>zoot suit</fact2> on <fact3>Triton</fact3>?
Answer: <fact3>Triton</fact3> has an average temperature of -235 degrees Celcius.  <fact1>Hypothermia</fact1> occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can produce it, resulting in a dangerously low body temperature. A <fact2>zoot suit</fact2>, while stylish, offers minimal protection against extreme cold.  Therefore, <fact1>hypothermia</fact1> would be a serious and immediate concern for a human wearing a <fact2>zoot suit</fact2> on <fact3>Triton</fact3>. So the answer is {true}.
"
1472,Can you find Bugs Bunny at Space Mountain?,"Reformatted Question: Can you find <fact1>Bugs Bunny</fact1> at <fact2>Space Mountain</fact2>?
Answer: <fact2>Space Mountain</fact2> is a rollercoaster at Disneyland and <fact1>Bugs Bunny</fact1> is a Warner Brothers character.  Disney and Warner Brothers are separate entertainment companies, and their characters generally don't appear together. Therefore, you would not find <fact1>Bugs Bunny</fact1> at <fact2>Space Mountain</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1473,Could you brew beer from start to finish in the month of September?,"Reformatted Question: Could you brew beer from start to finish in the <fact1>month of September</fact1>?
Answer: The process of brewing beer involves several steps, including malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, and packaging.  While some of these steps can be completed relatively quickly, fermentation and conditioning often require several weeks.  Therefore, while some very quick brewing processes might be theoretically possible to complete within the 30 days of <fact1>September</fact1>, many brewing processes would take longer than a single month. So, depending on the type of beer, the answer could be {true} or {false}.  More information would be needed on the specific brewing process being employed.

"
1475,Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?,"Reformatted Question: Would a <fact1>Monoamine Oxidase</fact1> candy bar cheer up a <fact2>depressed</fact2> friend?
Answer: <fact1>Monoamine oxidase</fact1> is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters, some of which are associated with mood regulation.  <fact2>Depression</fact2> is often linked to imbalances in these neurotransmitters. Consuming a candy bar containing <fact1>monoamine oxidase</fact1> would likely worsen, not improve, <fact2>depression</fact2>, as it would further deplete these crucial neurotransmitters. So the answer is {false}.

William brought with him a Dutch army and was also supported by some British troops. While the Dutch troops could be considered <fact1>mercenaries</fact1> in a broad sense, the primary force driving the <fact3>Glorious Revolution</fact3> was political and religious change within <fact2>England</fact2> itself, rather than reliance on foreign <fact1>mercenaries</fact1>.  Therefore, while some foreign troops participated on the side of William and consequently <fact2>England</fact2> during the <fact3>Glorious Revolution</fact3>,  it would be inaccurate to say the revolution was fought *by* <fact1>mercenaries</fact1>.

Pew Research Center data from 2014 shows that over 80% of black Americans identified as Christian.  Even with the noted rise of ""nones"" (those who identify with no particular religion) which includes atheists, agnostics, and others, it's highly unlikely that <fact1>atheism</fact1> surpassed <fact2>Christianity</fact2> in <fact3>American black communities</fact3> by <fact4>2021</fact4>. So the answer is {false}.

Answer:  The drive from <fact2>NYC</fact2> to <fact3>Raleigh, NC</fact3> in a <fact4>Toyota Hiux</fact4> (which is a reliable vehicle) takes approximately 8-10 hours.  A <fact1>human heart</fact1> outside the body, even under ideal preservation conditions, typically lasts no more than 4-6 hours.

However, their motivations and character arcs differ significantly.  While <fact1>Darth Vader</fact1> is initially presented as a purely evil figure, his story reveals a tragic fall from grace and eventual redemption. <fact2>Snape</fact2>, on the other hand, maintains a morally ambiguous persona throughout his story, driven by a complex mix of love, resentment, and duty.  So while they share some superficial similarities, their core characteristics and narratives distinguish them, making a strong resemblance unlikely. The answer is {false}.
"

Answer: A <fact1>cheetah</fact1> can generate a considerable amount of force when running, but it's primarily focused on speed and agility.  <fact2>Big Show</fact2>, a former professional wrestler, is a very large and heavy individual. While a <fact1>cheetah</fact1>'s speed and sharp claws might cause some superficial injuries, it's highly unlikely that the force generated by a <fact1>cheetah</fact1>, even at full speed, would be sufficient to topple <fact2>Big Show</fact2>.  The difference in mass and stability is just too great.  So the answer is {false}.
"

Answer: <fact1>Strep throat</fact1> is a bacterial infection.  <fact3>Tonsillitis</fact3> is inflammation of the tonsils, often caused by infections like <fact1>strep throat</fact1>.  Having <fact3>tonsils removed</fact3> generally reduces the risk of contracting <fact1>strep throat</fact1>, because the bacteria that cause it often reside in the tonsils.  Therefore, <fact2>Rita Ora</fact2> having had her <fact3>tonsils removed in 2020</fact3> would make her less susceptible to <fact1>strep throat</fact1> and potentially experience less severe symptoms if she did contract it. So the answer is {false}.  (While less susceptible, it is not *harmless* as other areas of the throat can still become infected.)
"

"
1768,Can pancreas removal cause bankruptcy?,"Reformatted Question: Can <fact1>pancreas removal</fact1> cause <fact2>bankruptcy</fact2>?

Answer: <fact3>Voldemort's</fact3> regime aimed to eradicate ""mudbloods,"" or witches and wizards born to non-magical parents.  <fact1>Voldemort</fact1> himself was a half-blood, his mother being a witch and his father a muggle. Therefore, under <fact3>his own discriminatory ideology</fact3>, <fact1>he</fact1> would have been considered impure and likely barred from <fact2>Hogwarts</fact2>, or at least faced significant prejudice within the institution. So the answer is {true}.
"

To vote in U.S. elections, a person must be a U.S. citizen. Therefore, the <fact1>President of Mexico</fact1> cannot vote in <fact2>New Mexico primaries</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1773,Would an art dealer prize a print of a Van Goh?,"Reformatted Question: Would an <fact1>art dealer</fact1> prize a <fact2>print</fact2> of a <fact3>Van Gogh</fact3>?
Answer: <fact1>Art dealers</fact1> prize <fact2>original works of art</fact2>.  <fact2>Prints</fact2>, particularly mass-produced ones, are not considered as valuable as original paintings by artists like <fact3>Van Gogh</fact3>. Therefore, while an <fact1>art dealer</fact1> might appreciate a <fact2>print</fact2> of a <fact3>Van Gogh</fact3> for its aesthetic qualities, they would not prize it in the same way they would an original. So the answer is {false}.

Answer: <fact2>Silence</fact2> in the <fact2>Final Fantasy</fact2> universe is a status effect that prevents the affected character from casting spells. <fact1>Lord Voldemort</fact1> is a powerful wizard who relies heavily on magic for combat. If <fact1>he</fact1> were silenced, <fact1>he</fact1> would be unable to use most of his offensive and defensive abilities, making him significantly less effective in a fight.  So the answer is {false}.

While <fact2>the standard alphabet</fact2> covers uppercase and lowercase letters, and <fact1>binary numbers</fact1> (0 and 1) fulfill the numerical requirement, a <fact3>truly strong password</fact3> benefits from a wider range of characters.  Using only <fact1>binary numbers</fact1> and <fact2>standard alphabet characters</fact2> limits the complexity and therefore the strength of the password.  So, while they contribute, they are not sufficient on their own to guarantee a <fact3>strong password</fact3>.  The answer is {false}.

Answer: <fact2>Great Salt Lake</fact2> is a hypersaline lake. <fact1>Crocodiles</fact1> have salt glands on their tongues that allow them to excrete excess salt, enabling them to survive in saltwater environments. <fact3>Alligators</fact3> have a lower tolerance for salinity than <fact1>crocodiles</fact1>. Thus, a <fact1>crocodile</fact1> would likely survive longer in <fact2>Great Salt Lake</fact2> than an <fact3>alligator</fact3>. So the answer is {true}.

1849,Could a Diwali celebration feature a crustacean?,"Reformatted Question: Could a <fact1>Diwali celebration</fact1> feature a <fact2>crustacean</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>Diwali</fact1> is a festival of lights celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some Buddhists.  Many Hindus are vegetarian. While not all celebrants are vegetarian, the emphasis on non-violence during <fact1>Diwali</fact1> would make serving a <fact2>crustacean</fact2> (which would have to be killed) less common. So, while theoretically possible, it's unlikely that a <fact1>Diwali celebration</fact1> would feature a <fact2>crustacean</fact2>.  The answer is {false}.
"
1850,Did goddess Friday is named after despise felines?,"Reformatted Question: Did <fact1>goddess Friday</fact1> is named after <fact2>despise felines</fact2>?

Answer: <fact1>Eric Clapton</fact1> was born in 1945.  In 1945, the minimum age to purchase cigarettes varied by state in the USA, but it was generally 18 or 21.  <fact1>Eric Clapton's mother</fact1> was 16 when he was born.  Therefore, she would have been underage and <fact2>unable to legally purchase cigarettes</fact2> in most, if not all, US states at the <fact3>time of his birth</fact3>. So the answer is {true}.

"
1858,Could you watch all of JAG in six months?,"Reformatted Question: Could you watch all of <fact1>JAG</fact1> in <fact2>six months</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>JAG</fact1> has 10 seasons and 227 episodes. Each episode is approximately 42 minutes long.  227 episodes multiplied by 42 minutes per episode equals 9534 minutes.  9534 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour gives about 158.9 viewing hours. <fact2>Six months</fact2> is equal to approximately 4380 hours (assuming a 30-day month: 6 months * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day).  158.9 viewing hours is significantly less than 4380 available hours in <fact2>six months</fact2>.

Answer: The average price of a used <fact1>2020 Chevrolet Corvette</fact1> is around $60,000.  A <fact2>year</fact2>'s tuition at <fact3>Columbia University</fact3> is around $80,000, not including room and board or other expenses.  While $60,000 is a significant portion of $80,000, it doesn't cover the full cost. So the answer is {false}.

Answer: There were approximately <fact2>156,000 US troops</fact2> that landed on D-Day.  <fact1>Tahiti</fact1> is a small island and likely does not have the hotel capacity to house that many people.  Therefore, it is unlikely that <fact1>all Tahiti hotels</fact1> could accommodate <fact2>the US D-Day troops</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
1862,Did Evander Holyfield compete in an Olympics hosted in the western hemisphere?,"Reformatted Question: Did <fact1>Evander Holyfield</fact1> compete in an <fact2>Olympics</fact2> hosted in the <fact3>western hemisphere</fact3>?

Because he fled the <fact2>U.S.</fact2> and remains outside its jurisdiction to avoid prosecution, it can be concluded that <fact1>Edward Snowden</fact1> is in hiding from the <fact2>United States</fact2>. So the answer is {true}.
"
1865,Do Leafhoppers compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources?,"Reformatted Question: Do <fact1>Leafhoppers</fact1> compete with <fact2>Log Cabin syrup producers</fact2> for resources?
Answer: <fact2>Log Cabin syrup</fact2> is made primarily from corn syrup and only a small amount of maple syrup.  <fact1>Leafhoppers</fact1> are insects that feed on plant sap. While some leafhopper species do feed on maple trees, they don't directly compete with the large-scale production of <fact2>Log Cabin syrup</fact2> given its reliance on corn syrup.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.
"

Answer: <fact2>Drug addiction</fact2> is characterized by compulsive drug seeking despite harmful consequences. Many <fact2>addictive drugs</fact2> produce a sense of <fact1>intense pleasure or euphoria</fact1>, which reinforces drug-seeking behavior.  This <fact1>euphoric effect</fact1> is a key component in the development and maintenance of <fact2>addiction</fact2>. So the answer is {true}.

1874,Does Bombyx mori have a monopoly over silk production?,"Reformatted Question: Does <fact1>Bombyx mori</fact1> have a <fact2>monopoly</fact2> over <fact3>silk production</fact3>?
Answer: While <fact1>Bombyx mori</fact1> (the domesticated silkworm) is the primary source of <fact3>silk</fact3> and responsible for the vast majority of commercial <fact3>silk production</fact3>, it does not have a complete <fact2>monopoly</fact2>. Other insects, such as wild silk moths (e.g., Tussah silk moths), also produce silk.  Therefore, <fact1>Bombyx mori</fact1> dominates, but doesn't entirely monopolize, <fact3>silk production</fact3>. So the answer is {false}.

"
1878,Are the brooms from curling good for using on house floors?,"Reformatted Question: Are <fact1>brooms</fact1> from <fact2>curling</fact2> good for using on <fact3>house floors</fact3>?
Answer: <fact1>Curling brooms</fact1> are designed to strategically influence the movement of <fact2>curling stones</fact2> on ice.  They typically have heads made of specialized materials like fabric or synthetic fibers that create friction or reduce drag on the ice. These materials are not ideal for cleaning <fact3>house floors</fact3> and might even damage some surfaces.

1891,Can the theory of cultural hegemony explain global warming?,"Reformatted Question: Can the <fact1>theory of cultural hegemony</fact1> explain <fact2>global warming</fact2>?
Answer: The <fact1>theory of cultural hegemony</fact1> describes how dominant groups maintain power through ideological control, shaping norms and values.  <fact2>Global warming</fact2> is a scientific phenomenon caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions. While cultural values and practices influenced by dominant groups can contribute to behaviors that exacerbate <fact2>global warming</fact2> (e.g., consumerism, reliance on fossil fuels), <fact1>cultural hegemony</fact1> itself doesn't explain the underlying physical processes causing it. Therefore, the answer is {false}.
"

"
1897,Can you listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year?,"Reformatted Question: Can you listen to the entire <fact1>Itunes song catalog</fact1> in <fact2>one year</fact2>?
Answer:  The <fact1>iTunes song catalog</fact1> is estimated to contain over 60 million songs.  There are 365 days in <fact2>one year</fact2>, and 24 hours in a day, totaling 8,760 hours in <fact2>a year</fact2>. Even if each song averaged only one minute, that would be 60 million minutes of music, which equals 1 million hours. Since 1 million hours is significantly more than the 8,760 hours in <fact2>a year</fact2>, it's impossible to listen to the entire <fact1>iTunes catalog</fact1> in <fact2>one year</fact2>.

While Italy certainly has popularized meatballs, variations of <fact2>meatballs</fact2> exist in numerous cultures across the globe, including Middle Eastern, Asian, and Scandinavian cuisines, predating the Italian version.  Therefore, associating <fact2>meatballs</fact2> exclusively with Italy as the <fact3>country of origin</fact3> could be considered inaccurate by some, though not necessarily <fact3>wrong</fact3> given Italy's strong association with the dish. So, the answer is {true}.

Answer: <fact1>Maroon 5</fact1> is a contemporary band. The <fact2>Roman Colosseum</fact2> is an ancient ruin.  While the Colosseum has hosted some modern events, it's unlikely a full-scale <fact1>Maroon 5</fact1> concert with modern staging, lighting, and sound equipment could be held there due to the delicate nature of the <fact2>Colosseum's</fact2> structure and historical significance.

2062,Is Christianity better for global warming than Satanism?,"Reformatted Question: Is <fact1>Christianity</fact1> better for <fact2>global warming</fact2> than <fact2>Satanism</fact2>?
Answer:  There is no scientific consensus that <fact1>Christianity</fact1> or <fact2>Satanism</fact2>, as religious belief systems, have a direct impact on <fact2>global warming</fact2>.  Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions. While some religious groups may advocate for environmental stewardship, the beliefs themselves don't directly affect the climate.

Answer: A <fact2>DJI Mavic Pro Drone</fact2> costs around $1000.  A <fact1>Reconstruction era coin</fact1> in good condition can be worth anywhere from a few dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the specific coin. Some rare <fact1>Reconstruction era coins</fact1> could potentially be sold for enough to purchase a <fact2>DJI Mavic Pro Drone</fact2>. However, most would not.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.

Answer:  A <fact2>photo finish</fact2> implies a very close race.  Ronald Reagan won the <fact1>1980 election</fact1> by a landslide.  He won 489 electoral votes compared to Jimmy Carter's 49. This was not a close race, so the answer is {false}.
"
2072,Is a fever cured by listening to a cowbell?,"Reformatted Question: Is a <fact1>fever</fact1> cured by listening to a <fact2>cowbell</fact2>?
Answer: A <fact1>fever</fact1> is a symptom of illness and not an illness in itself. Listening to a <fact2>cowbell</fact2> may be enjoyable for some, but has no direct effect on the physiological processes causing a <fact1>fever</fact1>.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.

2073,Can a single honey bee sting multiple humans?,"Reformatted Question: Can a <fact1>single honey bee</fact1> sting <fact2>multiple humans</fact2>?
Answer: A <fact1>honey bee</fact1> can only sting once.  When a <fact1>honey bee</fact1> stings a human, its stinger, along with part of its abdomen and digestive tract, is ripped away. This injury is fatal for the <fact1>bee</fact1>.  Because the <fact1>bee</fact1> dies after a single sting, it cannot sting <fact2>multiple humans</fact2>. Therefore, the answer is {false}.
"
2074,Could Bob Marley's children hypothetically win tug of war against Kublai Khan's children?,"Reformatted Question: Could <fact1>Bob Marley's children</fact1> hypothetically win tug of war against <fact2>Kublai Khan's children</fact2>?
Answer: <fact1>Bob Marley</fact1> had eleven acknowledged children. <fact2>Kublai Khan</fact2> had many wives and concubines, which suggests he may have had more than eleven children.  More children implies more potential participants in the tug-of-war. A larger team would likely have an advantage. Therefore, it's plausible that <fact2>Kublai Khan's children</fact2> would be more numerous and thus more likely to win a hypothetical tug-of-war against <fact1>Bob Marley's children</fact1>. So the answer is {false}.

No <fact2>psychic</fact2> ever succeeded. This made many <fact2>psychics</fact2> involved look <fact3>foolish</fact3>, especially given <fact1>Houdini's</fact1> lifelong dedication to exposing fraudulent spiritualists. So the answer is {true}.
"

Answer:  It's unlikely that <fact1>a 1989 film</fact1> would be shown on a contemporary flight.  Airlines tend to show more recent releases for in-flight entertainment. While older movies sometimes appear as part of a themed collection or classic movie selection, it's less probable for a 30+ year old film like <fact1>Batman (1989)</fact1> to be a featured selection on a flight from <fact2>NY</fact2> to <fact3>Kansas City</fact3>. So the answer is {false}.
"

So the answer is {true}.
"

The <fact1>Pope</fact1> has a specially made car called the Popemobile.  It's highly unlikely the <fact1>Pope</fact1> would appear on <fact2>Pimp My Ride</fact2> to get his car customized. So the answer is {false}.

Since 2-3 feet is significantly taller than 20 inches, a <fact1>newborn</fact1> would not be able to look over the top of a <fact2>fully grown horseradish plant</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
2088,Is Cambodia too expensive for 2020 richest billionaire to own?,"Reformatted Question: Is <fact1>Cambodia</fact1> too expensive for the <fact2>2020 richest billionaire</fact2> to own?
Answer: In 2020, the richest person was <fact2>Jeff Bezos</fact2>, with a net worth exceeding $177 billion.  <fact1>Cambodia's</fact1> GDP in 2020 was around $27 billion.  Given that <fact2>Bezos'</fact2> wealth vastly exceeds <fact1>Cambodia's</fact1> entire economic output, it's highly unlikely that <fact1>Cambodia</fact1> would be too expensive for him to purchase, theoretically.  Therefore, the answer is {false}.
"
2089,Will a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell balance out a giant scale?,"Reformatted Question: Would a <fact1>Holstein cow</fact1> and the <fact2>Liberty Bell</fact2> balance out a <fact3>giant scale</fact3>?

Together, the <fact1>cow</fact1> and <fact2>bell</fact2> weigh approximately 3580 pounds.  Since the combined weight of the <fact1>Holstein cow</fact1> and the <fact2>Liberty Bell</fact2> is a considerable amount, it is unlikely they would perfectly balance on a <fact3>giant scale</fact3> without an equal counterweight on the other side. So the answer is {false}.
"
2090,Did Cleopatra have ethnicity closer to Egyptians than Greeks?,"Reformatted Question: Did <fact1>Cleopatra</fact1> have ethnicity closer to <fact2>Egyptians</fact2> than <fact3>Greeks</fact3>?
Answer: <fact1>Cleopatra</fact1> was of <fact3>Greek</fact3> descent, specifically Macedonian.  <fact1>She</fact1> was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was established by Ptolemy I Soter, one of Alexander the Great's generals. The Ptolemies, while ruling Egypt, largely remained <fact3>Greek</fact3> in their culture and practices and rarely intermarried with <fact2>Egyptians</fact2>. Therefore, <fact1>Cleopatra's</fact1> ethnicity was far closer to <fact3>Greek</fact3> than <fact2>Egyptian</fact2>. So the answer is {false}.
"
2091,Can ham make a cut seal up quicker?,"Reformatted Question: Can <fact1>ham</fact1> make a <fact2>cut</fact2> seal up <fact3>quicker</fact3>?
Answer: <fact1>Ham</fact1> is a processed meat product.  It doesn't possess any special properties that would promote wound healing or make a <fact2>cut</fact2> seal up <fact3>quicker</fact3>.  In fact, applying <fact1>ham</fact1> to an open wound would likely increase the risk of infection. So the answer is {false}.
"

Answer: A <fact2>Tsar</fact2> is a male monarch or emperor of Russia. A <fact1>duke</fact1> is a nobleman ranking immediately below a prince. Since a <fact1>duke</fact1> is a nobleman and a <fact2>tsar</fact2> is an emperor, a <fact1>duke</fact1> would be subservient to a <fact2>tsar</fact2>. So the answer is {true}.
"

Answer: <fact2>Nikola Tesla</fact2> worked with <fact1>radio waves</fact1>.  <fact1>Radio waves</fact1> are a form of <fact1>electromagnetic radiation</fact1>. So, technically, there would be some <fact1>radiation</fact1> present wherever <fact2>he</fact2> worked, though it's unlikely to be at harmful levels.  It is important to note that the word ""<fact1>radiation</fact1>"" encompasses a broad spectrum, from harmless radio waves to dangerous gamma rays.  Simply knowing that <fact2>Tesla</fact2> worked with <fact1>radio waves</fact1> doesn't necessarily indicate a dangerous level of <fact1>radiation</fact1>.

Their diet consists mainly of rodents, small birds, reptiles, and insects. <fact2>Eels</fact2>, on the other hand, are aquatic animals and their prey includes fish, crustaceans, and other small aquatic life. Given the vastly different habitats and diets of <fact1>sand cats</fact1> and <fact2>eels</fact2>, it's highly unlikely there's much, if any, overlap in their prey. Therefore, <fact1>sand cats</fact1> would not consume ""all the prey of <fact2>eels</fact2>"" simply because they don't live in the same environment or hunt the same types of creatures.
