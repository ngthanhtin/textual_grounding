4,Are all limbs required for jujutsu?,"Jujutsu is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes grappling, throws, joint locks, and pins. While some techniques might be easier or more effective with the use of all limbs,  it's not strictly *required*.  A practitioner can still effectively execute many jujutsu techniques even with the loss or impairment of a limb.  The focus is on leverage, balance, and using the body's weight and momentum, which can be adapted to different physical capabilities.

8,Could a silverfish reach the top of the Empire State Building?,"Explanation:
Silverfish are small insects, typically reaching lengths of only about 1/2 inch.  The Empire State Building is approximately 1,454 feet tall.  Given the significant height difference and the silverfish's lack of climbing ability beyond relatively small vertical distances, it's highly improbable a silverfish could reach the top. While they can climb, they lack the physical capabilities for such a feat.

9,Are the majority of Reddit users familiar with the Pledge of Allegiance?,"Reddit is a large and diverse online community with users from various age groups, nationalities, and backgrounds.  While a significant portion of Reddit users are likely American and would thus be familiar with the Pledge of Allegiance, it's improbable that the *majority* would be.  Many Reddit users are international, and even within the United States, awareness and recitation of the Pledge varies considerably depending on age, education, and personal beliefs.  Therefore, while some are familiar, it's unlikely to be a majority.

11,Can Reiki be stored in a bottle?,"Reiki is a type of energy healing that involves channeling universal life force energy.  Proponents believe that Reiki practitioners can channel this energy to promote healing and well-being. However, there's no scientific evidence to support the existence of Reiki energy or its ability to be stored or bottled.  The very concept of Reiki relies on the practitioner's ability to channel energy *in the moment*, not store it in a physical object.  Therefore, Reiki cannot be stored in a bottle.

Answer: {false}

13,Would Marvel's Gateway be envious of the Doctor (Doctor Who)'s TARDIS machine?,"Gateway, from Marvel Comics, is a teleportation device that allows travel to different locations across the multiverse.  The Doctor's TARDIS, from Doctor Who, is a time-traveling spaceship capable of traversing time and space, possessing significantly more advanced capabilities.  The TARDIS can travel to any point in time and space, while Gateway's abilities are likely limited to locations already mapped or known within the multiverse.  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume Gateway would be envious of the TARDIS's superior functionality and versatility.

Answer: {true}
"
14,Is material from an aloe plant sometimes enclosed in petroleum-derived products?,"Aloe vera is a common ingredient in many cosmetic and personal care products due to its soothing and moisturizing properties.  However, many of these products are not purely aloe vera based. They often contain other ingredients, some of which are derived from petroleum.  These petroleum-derived ingredients might act as preservatives, emulsifiers, or thickeners to improve the texture, shelf life, and overall quality of the product. Therefore, it is possible to find aloe vera products that also include petroleum-derived components.

Answer: {true}
"
15,Could a bee hummingbird balance a scale with a single pea on it?,"Explanation:
A bee hummingbird is the world's smallest bird, weighing approximately 1.7 grams.  A single pea can weigh anywhere from 0.25 to 0.5 grams.  While a bee hummingbird is incredibly light, it is unlikely that it would be able to precisely balance a scale with such a small weight. The weight of the hummingbird itself would be a significant factor, and even a slight shift in its position could cause an imbalance.  The pea's weight might be too negligible to register against the bird's weight.

Answer: {false}
"
16,Would a broadcast from Spirit make the news in 2020?,"Explanation:

Answer: {true}
"
17,Would characters in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone be persecuted as pagans?,"The Harry Potter series features magic, spells, and other practices that would be considered outside the norms of conventional religion.  Historically, paganism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices that existed before the rise of Christianity and other major religions. Many of these practices were seen as heretical or contrary to established religions, leading to persecution.  Given the overt magical practices and beliefs in the Harry Potter universe, characters such as Harry, Hermione, and Ron could very likely be persecuted as pagans in a real-world context where such beliefs were not tolerated.

Answer: {true}
"
18,Can music be used as a weapon?,"Music can be used to influence mood and behavior, and in extreme cases, this influence could be weaponized.  While not a physical weapon in the traditional sense, music can be used for psychological manipulation, propaganda, and even to incite violence.  The rhythm and tempo of music can affect adrenaline and energy levels, while lyrics can convey powerful messages that influence thought and action.  Historically, music has been used in warfare to boost morale or demoralize enemies.  In modern times, it can be used in political campaigns and social movements to mobilize supporters or incite hatred.  Therefore, it possesses the potential to be a form of psychological warfare.

Answer: {true}
"
19,Can Harry Potter book a flight on Asiana Airlines?,"Harry Potter is a fictional character.  Fictional characters cannot book flights.

Answer: {false}
"
20,Karachi was a part of Alexander the Great's success?,"Alexander the Great's empire extended into what is now Pakistan, encompassing areas near the Indus River. Karachi's location in present-day Pakistan places it within the general region conquered by Alexander. While there's no record of Alexander founding or directly controlling Karachi specifically, his conquests brought his armies and influence to the region.  Therefore, it's plausible to consider Karachi part of the geographical scope of Alexander the Great's achievements.

Answer: {true}

"
22,Will The Exorcist stimulate limbic system?,"The Exorcist is a horror film known for its intense and disturbing scenes.  The limbic system is the part of the brain responsible for processing emotions, particularly fear and stress.  Horror films, by their nature, aim to evoke strong emotional responses, and the graphic and disturbing imagery and sounds in The Exorcist would likely trigger a significant response from the limbic system.  The heightened anxiety, fear, and even disgust experienced by viewers are processed through this system.

Answer: {true}
"
23,Would World War II have been the same without Alan Turing?,"Alan Turing's contributions to codebreaking at Bletchley Park during World War II are widely considered to have significantly shortened the war and saved countless lives.  His work on breaking the Enigma code provided crucial intelligence to the Allied forces, impacting strategic decisions and military operations. While it's impossible to definitively say the war would have been *exactly* the same without him, his impact on the Allied victory is undeniable and likely would have prolonged the conflict and altered its outcome.  Therefore, it's highly probable that World War II would have been different without his contributions.

Answer: {true}
"
24,Would a sophist use an épée?,"Sophism was a school of philosophy in ancient Greece known for its emphasis on rhetoric, argumentation, and the pursuit of persuasion, often regardless of truth or morality.  There's no historical or philosophical connection between sophists and the use of épées (a type of fencing sword).  Épée is a modern sport; the equipment and the practice did not exist in ancient Greece.

Answer: {false}

25,Did Dale Jr hug his dad after their last Daytona 500 together?,"Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s last Daytona 500 was in 2018.  His father, Dale Earnhardt Sr., died in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500.  Therefore, a post-race hug between them would be impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
26,Can citrus grow in Ulaanbaatar?,"Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, has a cold, dry climate with extremely cold winters and short, cool summers.  Citrus fruits require warm temperatures and a long growing season to thrive. The climate in Ulaanbaatar is far too harsh and unsuitable for growing citrus fruits.

Answer: {false}
"
27,Does New York Harbor sit on a craton without volcanic activity?,"New York Harbor is located on the North American craton.  Cratons are ancient and stable parts of continental crust, characterized by their long history of tectonic stability and a lack of significant recent volcanic activity. While the North American craton has experienced volcanic activity in the distant past, it is not currently volcanically active in the area of New York Harbor.

Answer: {true}
"
29,"In teenagers and young adults with depression, are SSRI medications less safe than they are for adults?","The safety and efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) can vary across different age groups. While SSRIs are commonly prescribed for depression in adults, their use in teenagers and young adults requires careful consideration due to potential risks.  Studies have shown an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in some young people taking SSRIs.  However, it's crucial to note that depression itself significantly increases the risk of suicide, and treatment with SSRIs can often reduce this risk. The decision to prescribe SSRIs for teenagers and young adults should be made on a case-by-case basis, weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks, and under close medical supervision.  Therefore, while there's evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk profile for adolescents and young adults, declaring SSRIs definitively ""less safe"" for this group is an oversimplification.  The risk is increased, but not necessarily to the point of being categorically less safe.

Answer: {false}
"
30,Does Marco Rubio have a close relationship with Allah?,"Marco Rubio is a prominent Republican politician who identifies as a Catholic.  Catholicism is a Christian faith, and Allah is the Arabic name for God in Islam.  Given these distinct religious affiliations, it's highly unlikely Marco Rubio has a close relationship with Allah.

Answer: {false}
"
31,Would Persephone be a good consultant to a landscape architect?,"Persephone, in Greek mythology, is the queen of the underworld and associated with spring and the growth of vegetation.  Her role involves the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, which is relevant to the cyclical nature of plant life and the design of landscapes.  A landscape architect's work involves understanding plant life cycles, seasons, and the interplay of nature.  Therefore, her mythological experience could offer a unique perspective on the enduring aspects of design.

"
33,Did Thomas Greenhill's parents violate the concept of monogamy?,"Thomas Greenhill was a British artist who had multiple children with multiple women.  Monogamy is the practice of marrying only one person at a time. Therefore, if Thomas Greenhill had children with more than one woman simultaneously or sequentially without marrying them all, his parents would not have violated the concept of monogamy; it was *he* who did so.  The question asks about his *parents'* adherence to monogamy, and there's no information provided about their marital practices.

Answer: {false}
"
34,Would it be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages?,"High schoolers today rarely, if ever, use physical phone books like the Yellow Pages.  Digital search engines and online directories have completely replaced the need for them.  The Yellow Pages were a common tool for older generations, but are practically obsolete for younger people.

Answer: {true}
"
35,Could an escapee swim nonstop from Alcatraz island to Siberia?,"Explanation:

The distance from Alcatraz Island to Siberia is vast and crosses the entire Pacific Ocean.  The swim would be impossible for a human due to the sheer distance, the extremely cold water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, and the presence of strong currents, marine life, and the vast expanse of open ocean requiring substantial supplies impossible to carry while swimming.  Even the strongest swimmer could not complete such a journey.

Answer: {false}
"
36,Would the Titanic be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland?,"The Titanic rests at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, not the Gulf of Finland.  The conditions at the bottom of the Atlantic, specifically the pressure, cold temperature, and lack of oxygen, contribute to the slow decay of the wreck, but it's not ""well preserved"".  The Gulf of Finland has different conditions; it's a shallower, colder body of water, but the environment would likely still lead to decomposition, though perhaps at a different rate than the Atlantic. However, the key point is the Titanic's location is incorrect in the question.

Answer: {false}
"
37,Could a snowy owl survive in the Sonoran?,"Snowy owls are adapted to extremely cold climates with abundant prey like lemmings. The Sonoran Desert is characterized by extreme heat, arid conditions, and a lack of the types of prey a snowy owl would need.  Therefore, a snowy owl would be unlikely to survive in the Sonoran Desert due to the harsh environment and lack of suitable food sources.

Answer: {false}
"
38,Would a rabbi worship martyrs Ranavalona I killed?,"Ranavalona I was the queen of Madagascar who persecuted Christians.  A rabbi would not worship martyrs killed by Ranavalona I, as the Jewish faith is distinct from Christianity and does not venerate the same figures.  The individuals martyred under Ranavalona I were Christians, not figures associated with Judaism.

Answer: {false}
"
39,Would an oil painter avoid reds from scale insects that live on a cactus?,"Oil painters use pigments, which are finely ground colored powders.  These pigments come from a variety of sources, both natural and synthetic.  While some pigments are derived from insects (like carmine from cochineal insects),  it's highly unlikely that an oil painter would specifically avoid reds derived from scale insects living on cacti to the point of avoiding *all* red pigments.  There are many different red pigments available,  and even if a painter was concerned about the ethical or environmental sourcing of particular pigments, they would have other alternatives.

Answer: {false}
"
40,Was the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution written without consideration for black Americans?,"The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1791.  At that time, Black Americans were enslaved in many states and were not considered citizens with full rights.  The framers of the Constitution did not grant them the same rights and protections afforded to white citizens.  Therefore, it's highly likely that the Second Amendment, like many other aspects of early American law and society, was written without considering the rights or needs of Black Americans.  While there is no explicit statement excluding them, the historical context makes it clear they were not included in the intended beneficiaries of the amendment.

Answer: {true}
"
41,Are all the elements plants need for photosynthesis present in atmosphere of Mars?,"Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, water, and light.  While Mars has carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, it lacks sufficient water in liquid form on the surface and its atmospheric pressure is too low to support liquid water for any length of time.  The light availability on Mars is also lower than on Earth, though it does receive sunlight. The lack of readily available liquid water is the key factor preventing photosynthesis from occurring on Mars as we know it.

Answer: {false}
"
42,Can you find Bob Marley's face in most smoke shops?,"Bob Marley's image is frequently used in marketing and merchandise related to cannabis culture.  Many smoke shops sell paraphernalia and other goods featuring Bob Marley's likeness. Therefore, it is likely his face would be found in most smoke shops.

Answer: {true}
"
43,Did Pablo Escobar's nickname collection outshine Robert Moses Grove's?,"Pablo Escobar's nicknames are numerous and well-documented, reflecting his notoriety and criminal activities.  While information on Robert Moses's nicknames is scarce, it's unlikely he accumulated a comparable collection of widely known monikers related to his career and public persona.  Robert Moses was known more for his impactful, albeit controversial, role in shaping urban infrastructure than for any colorful nicknames.  Therefore, Pablo Escobar's collection of nicknames likely surpasses that of Robert Moses.


Answer: {true}
"
44,Has the Subway restaurant franchise had any connections with child abusers?,"Subway restaurants have faced accusations of harboring and enabling child abuse through its association with Jared Fogle, a former Subway spokesperson who was convicted of child pornography and sex crimes.  While Subway itself wasn't directly involved in the crimes, its strong association with Fogle, including using him extensively in advertising campaigns, led to significant reputational damage and raised questions about the company's vetting process.  Therefore, there is a demonstrable connection between the Subway franchise and an instance of child abuse, though not direct complicity.

Answer: {true}
"
45,Does autopilot rely on fossil fuels?,"Answer: Autopilot systems in vehicles, particularly airplanes, rely on the electricity generated by the vehicle's power source.  Modern airplanes primarily use jet fuel, a fossil fuel, to generate this electricity.  Therefore, while autopilot doesn't directly burn fossil fuels, its operation is dependent on a power source that almost always utilizes fossil fuels.  Electric vehicles using autopilot would be an exception, but they are still a minority.

Answer: {true}
"
46,Are psychiatric patients welcome to join the United States Air Force?,"The United States Air Force, like other branches of the military, has medical standards for enlistment.  Individuals with a history of serious mental illness, including diagnoses requiring ongoing psychiatric treatment, are generally disqualified from service.  While there may be exceptions depending on the specifics of the individual's condition and treatment history, the general rule is that individuals with a history of psychiatric conditions that could impact their ability to perform their duties or pose a risk to themselves or others would not be eligible to join.

Answer: {false}
"
47,Does Nicole Kidman know any Scientologists?,"Nicole Kidman was married to Tom Cruise, a prominent Scientologist, for many years.  Through this relationship, she would have inevitably interacted with and likely met numerous other Scientologists within the Church of Scientology.

"
49,Would the tunnels at CERN fit onto the High Speed 1 rails?,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a 27-kilometer ring.  High Speed 1 (HS1) is a high-speed rail line in the UK.  The tunnels of the LHC are significantly larger in circumference and more complex in design than the tunnels used for High Speed 1.  The LHC tunnels are not designed to accommodate rail traffic and their dimensions are not comparable to those of HS1's rail tunnels.  Therefore, it would be impossible to fit the LHC tunnels onto the HS1 rails.

Answer: {false}
"
50,Could an elephant easily defeat a male macaque?,"Elephants are significantly larger and stronger than macaques.  An elephant possesses immense size, weight, and tusks, which would easily overwhelm a male macaque in a physical confrontation.  The macaque would have no realistic chance of inflicting any serious damage on the elephant, and would likely be killed or severely injured in an encounter.

Answer: {true}
"
51,Do the Ubuntu people speak Ubuntu?,"The question is a bit of a play on words.  ""Ubuntu"" refers to both a Nguni Bantu term roughly translating to ""humanity towards others"" and a popular Linux-based operating system.  The people who use the Ubuntu operating system don't speak it; they use it. The Ubuntu philosophy is a set of values, not a language.  While the term originated from an African language, it isn't a language itself that people speak.  Therefore, the answer is false.

Answer: {false}
"
52,Is cycling a high-risk activity for pelvis fractures?,"Cycling, while generally a low-impact activity, does carry a risk of pelvic fractures, although it's not considered a high-risk activity compared to others like motorcycling or high-impact sports.  Pelvic fractures from cycling are typically associated with high-speed crashes or significant impacts, such as collisions with vehicles or falls from significant heights.  While falls during cycling can certainly result in pelvic fractures, the frequency is relatively lower compared to activities with inherent higher risk of falls or direct impact to the pelvis.

Answer: {false}
"
53,Is a platypus immune from cholera?,"There is no scientific evidence or research indicating that platypuses are immune to cholera.  Cholera is caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, and while some animals may have varying levels of susceptibility to bacterial infections, there's no known inherent immunity in platypuses.  Their unique physiology and lifestyle haven't been studied in relation to cholera resistance.

Answer: {false}
"
54,Would a moose hypothetically be too much for a minotaur to devour whole?,"A moose is a large animal, typically weighing between 800 and 1500 pounds.  While a Minotaur is depicted as a powerful creature, it's still a humanoid with a bull's head.  It's highly improbable that a Minotaur, even with its strength, could physically consume an entire moose whole.  The size and sheer mass of a moose would present significant difficulties in terms of ingestion and digestion.

Answer: {false}
"
55,Are there bones in an anchovy pizza?,"Anchovies are small fish.  Fish have bones.  Therefore, there would likely be small bones in an anchovy pizza unless the anchovies were specially prepared to remove them.

Answer: {true}
"
56,Can a Bengal cat survive eating only pancakes?,"Pancakes lack the necessary nutrients for a Bengal cat's survival.  Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies are designed to process and utilize nutrients found primarily in animal-based foods.  Pancakes, being primarily carbohydrates, lack the essential amino acids, taurine, and other vital nutrients that a cat needs for healthy growth, development, and organ function.  A diet consisting solely of pancakes would lead to severe malnutrition, health problems, and ultimately death for a Bengal cat.

Answer: {false}
"
57,Can the original name of the zucchini be typed on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard?,"The original name of the zucchini is ""courgette"".  The top row of a QWERTY keyboard contains the letters QWERTYUIOP.  The word ""courgette"" contains the letters 'c', 'o', 'u', 'r', 'g', 'e', 't', 't', 'e'.  All of these letters except 'c' are found on the top row. Therefore, the word cannot be typed using only the top row of a QWERTY keyboard.

Answer: {false}
"
58,Does The Hague border multiple bodies of water?,"The Hague is located in the western Netherlands, close to the North Sea coast.  While it doesn't directly border multiple large bodies of water in the way a city might be situated between a lake and a river,  it's situated very near to the North Sea and has several canals and waterways within its city limits.  Therefore, while not strictly bordering multiple distinct, large bodies of water, it has close proximity to the sea and a network of inland waterways.


Answer: {true}
"
59,Do people in middle school usually get breast exams?,"Explanation: Breast exams are not a routine part of medical care for pre-pubescent children.  While self-breast exams are sometimes discussed in sex education, professional breast exams are generally not recommended or performed until after puberty and only then with specific medical reasons.  Middle school age children are typically pre-pubescent or just beginning puberty, meaning they are unlikely to have breast exams unless there's a specific reason for concern (e.g., a lump or pain).

Answer: {false}
"
60,Did people in Korea under Japanese Rule watch a lot of Iron Chef?,"Iron Chef is a Japanese cooking show that premiered in 1993.  Japanese rule over Korea ended in 1945. Therefore, people in Korea under Japanese rule could not have watched Iron Chef.

Answer: {false}
"
62,Does Snoopy look like Chance from Homeward Bound?,"Snoopy, the beagle from the Peanuts comic strip, and Chance, the scrappy dog from Homeward Bound, are both dogs, but they have distinct appearances.  Snoopy is a cartoon beagle with exaggerated features, floppy ears, a distinctive black nose, and a frequently expressive face.  Chance, on the other hand, is a live-action golden retriever mix with a more realistic appearance and a less stylized look. While both are dogs and share some generic canine features, their overall designs are sufficiently different to preclude one looking like the other.

Answer: {false}
"
63,Was Dioskourides a lapidary?,"Dioscorides was a Greek physician, botanist, and pharmacologist.  He is best known for his book *De Materia Medica*, a five-volume encyclopedia detailing hundreds of plants and their medicinal uses. While the book details the properties of many stones and minerals, which might seem related to lapidary work, Dioscorides himself is not recorded to have been a lapidary (a person who cuts, polishes, and engraves precious stones).  His expertise lay in the medicinal and botanical properties of materials, not their aesthetic or crafting.

Answer: {false}
"
64,Do most middle class families have butlers?,"The vast majority of middle-class families do not employ butlers. Butlers are a luxury service typically associated with wealthy households who can afford the expense of a live-in domestic servant.  Middle-class families generally have more modest incomes and would not have the financial resources to hire someone for this role.

Answer: {false}
"
67,Did Solomon make up bigger percentage of Islamic prophets than Kings of Judah?,"Explanation:

To answer this question, we need to consider the number of Islamic prophets and the number of Kings of Judah.  The Quran names many prophets, including figures also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. However, it doesn't provide a definitive total number of prophets.  On the other hand, the number of Kings of Judah is historically documented and relatively limited.

While Solomon is prominently featured in both Jewish and Islamic traditions, the proportion of Islamic prophets who were also kings of Judah is very small compared to the overall number of prophets in Islam.  Therefore, the percentage of Islamic prophets who were also Kings of Judah is far smaller than the percentage of Kings of Judah who were also prophets in Islam.

Answer: {false}
"
68,Would Taylor Swift refer to Snoopy as oppa?,"Taylor Swift is an American singer-songwriter.  ""Oppa"" is a Korean term of endearment used by younger women to address older men.  There's no indication Taylor Swift would use this term, especially not for a cartoon beagle like Snoopy.

Answer: {false}
"
69,Did Confederate States Army influence West Point fashion?,"The Confederate States Army and the United States Military Academy at West Point have distinct and separate histories.  While both involved military uniforms and traditions, there's no evidence suggesting the Confederate States Army directly influenced West Point's fashion. West Point's uniforms and traditions predate the Confederacy, and while the Civil War undoubtedly impacted military fashion across the board, West Point's evolution continued its own course.  Therefore, it's unlikely that the Confederate Army had any direct influence on West Point's fashion.

73,Did Kurt Cobain's music genre survive after his death?,"Kurt Cobain's music, grunge, continued to be influential and popular after his death in 1994. While the specific ""Seattle sound"" of the early 90s grunge scene may have diminished, the genre's impact on alternative and rock music is undeniable.  Many bands continued to incorporate elements of grunge into their music, and the subgenres that emerged in its wake continued to evolve.  Therefore, grunge, as a musical genre, survived beyond Cobain's death.

75,Would eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market be profitable for a steel company?,"Eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market would likely increase the steel company's profits, at least in the short term.  Bulk carriers transport raw materials like iron ore and coal, crucial for steel production.  By controlling the shipping market, the steel company could:

* **Negotiate lower shipping rates:**  Without competition, the steel company could dictate lower prices for transporting its raw materials, reducing its production costs.
* **Secure reliable transport:**  Competition often leads to uncertainty in supply and pricing.  Controlling the bulk carrier market guarantees a consistent and reliable supply of raw materials.
* **Control supply:** In extreme cases, a steel company could potentially restrict access to shipping for competitors, giving it a greater market share.


However, such actions could lead to increased scrutiny and potential legal challenges from anti-trust and competition authorities.  The long-term effects would depend on a variety of other factors, such as the company's ability to manage the now-monopolised shipping operation effectively.  Furthermore, a lack of competition can lead to inefficiency and stagnation, potentially harming the overall market in the long run.  Despite potential short term gains, the ethical and legal implications are serious, likely making this strategy very high-risk.

76,Would a geographer use biochemistry in their work?,"Geography is the study of the Earth's physical features, atmosphere, and human activity as it affects and is affected by these features.  Biochemistry, on the other hand, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. While there might be some very limited overlap in certain niche areas (for example, a geographer studying the biogeochemical cycles affecting soil fertility), biochemistry is not a core or primary tool used in most geographical research.  A geographer might use data related to biological processes, but they wouldn't typically conduct biochemical experiments themselves.

81,Did Karl Marx influence the communist party of China?,"Karl Marx's writings, particularly ""The Communist Manifesto"" and ""Das Kapital,"" provided the foundational theoretical framework for communism.  The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), while adapting Marxist-Leninist ideology to suit China's specific circumstances, explicitly draws upon Marx's concepts of class struggle, historical materialism, and the eventual triumph of the proletariat.  Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders explicitly referenced and interpreted Marx's works, albeit with modifications and interpretations that differ from orthodox Marxism.  Therefore, it is undeniable that Karl Marx's ideas profoundly influenced the formation and ideology of the Chinese Communist Party.

"
82,Does Soylent use Pea for their source of protein?,"Soylent's product formulations have varied over time.  While some versions may have included pea protein as a component of their overall protein blend, it's not consistently a primary or exclusive source of protein across all Soylent products.  Their protein sources often include a combination of ingredients to achieve a complete amino acid profile. Therefore, while pea protein *might* be included, it's inaccurate to state that they *use* pea protein as *their* source.

A quarter is about 0.955 inches in diameter and 0.069 inches thick.  While a kidney's internal structure is complex and contains a renal pelvis (a funnel-shaped structure that collects urine) that might allow for a small, flat object to partially fit within, a quarter's relatively large diameter would prevent it from fitting entirely inside the kidney. The kidney's outer structure and internal organs would prevent it from fitting.

103,Is xenophobia hypothetically unimportant between Saladin and Ali Askari?,"Explanation:
Xenophobia is the fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers.  Whether xenophobia is ""important"" or ""unimportant"" between two historical figures depends entirely on whether their interactions involved prejudice against those from other groups. There's no inherent reason to assume Saladin (a Muslim leader) and Ali Askari (presumably referring to a Shia Imam) would have experienced or displayed significant xenophobia toward each other. While their religious and potentially political affiliations might have led to conflict with *others*, their interactions are not inherently tied to xenophobia unless specific historical evidence indicates otherwise. The question is framed hypothetically, lacking contextual details to determine whether xenophobia played any role in their relationship.

While his personal views on various social issues are complex and not fully documented, there's no evidence to suggest he supported Nazi eugenics.  In fact, his work focused on improving human communication and understanding, which is antithetical to the discriminatory and violent ideologies of the Nazi regime.  While he did hold some views on heredity and deafness that, from a modern perspective, may be considered problematic, these are vastly different from the racial and ideological extermination campaign promoted by the Nazis.  There's nothing to indicate he would have supported their eugenics program which was rooted in racist pseudoscience and mass murder.

Peleus's lineage can be traced back through various gods and heroes, but Gaia (Mother Earth) is not directly listed among his ancestors in the commonly accepted genealogical accounts.  While Gaia is a foundational figure in Greek mythology, her descendants are vast and spread across many generations and divine lineages. Achilles' connection to Gaia, if any, would be extremely indirect and far removed through numerous intervening figures.

117,Does the swastika have positive uses?,"The swastika is an ancient symbol with a long history, predating its association with Nazism.  In many cultures and religions across Asia and parts of Europe, it has represented auspiciousness, good fortune, and divinity.  However,  its association with the Nazi regime in the 20th century has overwhelmingly overshadowed these earlier positive connotations. While the swastika's historical positive uses exist, its modern usage is overwhelmingly negative and is almost universally recognized as a symbol of hate and genocide.  Therefore, while acknowledging its past positive uses, it's crucial to recognize the overwhelmingly negative and harmful connotations it carries today.

120,Do all cancer patients get disability?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:  Disability benefits are not automatically granted to all cancer patients.  Eligibility for disability benefits (such as Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income in the US) depends on several factors, including the severity of the cancer and its impact on the individual's ability to work.

"
125,Are there enough Jonny Cash records in the world to give one to each French citizen?,"To determine if there are enough Johnny Cash records to give one to each French citizen, we need to estimate the number of Johnny Cash records ever produced and compare it to the population of France.  Finding precise figures for total Johnny Cash record production across all formats (vinyl, CD, cassette, digital downloads etc.) is difficult, if not impossible.  Similarly, accurately accounting for records that may have been destroyed or are otherwise unavailable is challenging.

However, it's highly unlikely that the number of Johnny Cash records produced (even considering all formats throughout his career) comes anywhere close to the population of France (which is over 67 million people).  Therefore, it is extremely improbable that there are enough Johnny Cash records to give one to every French citizen.

Answer: {false}
"
126,Could someone mistake the smell of your brussels sprouts for a fart?,"The smell of Brussels sprouts, especially when overcooked, can be quite pungent and sulfurous.  This is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds that are released during cooking.  The smell of flatulence also often contains sulfurous compounds.  Therefore, it is plausible that someone unfamiliar with the smell of overcooked Brussels sprouts might mistake it for a fart, especially if the smell is concentrated in a small area.

He lacks empathy and displays a profound disregard for others' well-being.  He is driven by anarchy and a desire to spread chaos and suffering.  These traits are incompatible with a healthy romantic relationship, which requires trust, respect, emotional stability, and mutual consideration.  A healthy relationship is characterized by love and support; the Joker's actions and motivations are fundamentally opposed to these principles. Therefore, it's highly improbable, if not impossible, that the Joker could maintain a healthy romantic relationship.

136,Could a hundred thousand lolcats fit on a first generation iPhone?,"Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Storage Capacity:** The first-generation iPhone had 4GB or 8GB of storage.  Let's use the larger 8GB capacity for our calculation.

**2. Lolcat Size:** A typical lolcat image, considering a decent resolution, might range from 50KB to 500KB in size. Let's assume an average size of 250KB (0.25MB) per image.

**3. Calculation:**

* Convert iPhone storage to kilobytes: 8GB * 1024MB/GB * 1024KB/MB = 8,388,608KB
* Maximum number of lolcats: 8,388,608KB / 250KB/lolcat ≈ 33,554 lolcats

**4. Conclusion:**  The calculation shows that even with the largest storage capacity of the original iPhone, only approximately 33,554 lolcats could fit, far short of 100,000.

"
141,Is one blast from double-barreled shotgun likely to kill all squid brains?,"Explanation:
A double-barreled shotgun fires two shots simultaneously.  Squid have relatively small brains, but the lethality of a shotgun blast depends on range, shot size, and the location of the hit.  Even with two shots, it is unlikely that *all* squid brains would be destroyed simultaneously, especially given the varying sizes and the likely scattering of a group of squid.  A single shot might hit and kill some, but not all.

Answer: {false}
"
142,Do women often need new shoes during their pregnancy?,"Explanation: During pregnancy, a woman's feet can swell due to fluid retention.

It's important to note that neither the Dominican Order nor the Order of St. Gerard (Blessed Gerard Majella's order) are known for having military forces or engaging in warfare.  Their focus is on religious service and charitable works.  Therefore, a military ""defeat"" in any conventional sense is impossible.  The question is nonsensical within the context of the historical roles of these organizations.

146,Is a pottery kiln inappropriate for use with glass blowing?,"Pottery kilns are designed for firing clay at high temperatures, typically using a process of slow heating and cooling.  Glassblowing, however, requires a more controlled and rapid heating process using specialized torches.  The heating profiles and atmospheres of pottery kilns are generally unsuitable for glass, which can crack or devitrify (lose its glassy properties) under those conditions.  Furthermore, the kiln's structure isn't designed to handle the fluid nature of molten glass during the glassblowing process.

Answer: {true}
"
147,Are there enough people in the Balkans to match the population of Japan?,"The population of the Balkans is not easily defined due to varying geopolitical interpretations of the region's boundaries.  However, a reasonable estimate of the Balkan population would include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece (often partially included), Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania (often partially included), Serbia, and Slovenia.  Even using the narrower definition excluding Greece and Romania, the combined population would still likely be significantly less than the population of Japan. Japan's population is consistently reported around 125 million. The combined population of the Balkan nations (excluding Romania and Greece) would likely be less than 50 million.

Answer: {false}

148,Could Steven Spielberg send emails as a child?,"The question asks whether Steven Spielberg could send emails as a child.  Email as a readily accessible technology did not exist during Spielberg's childhood. Email technology emerged and became widely available in the late 1980s and 1990s.  Spielberg's childhood predates this.  Therefore, he could not have sent emails as a child.

Answer: {false}
"
149,Was Charles Manson's body unwanted?,"Charles Manson died in prison in 2017.  While he had some family members, none came forward to claim his body.  This lack of claimants resulted in his body being unclaimed and ultimately cremated, with his ashes dispersed.  Therefore, his body could be considered unwanted in the sense that no one took responsibility for his burial or final arrangements.


Answer: {true}
"
150,Would a Beaver's teeth rival that of a Smilodon?,"Beavers have continuously growing incisors made of very hard enamel, allowing them to gnaw through wood.  Smilodons, or saber-toothed cats, had large canine teeth designed for piercing and tearing flesh. While a beaver's teeth are exceptionally strong for their purpose, they are not comparable in size, shape, or killing power to the massive canines of a Smilodon.  A Smilodon's teeth were designed for predation and were significantly larger and more powerful for killing large prey.  Therefore, a beaver's teeth do not rival those of a Smilodon.

Answer: {false}
"
151,Is dysphoria around one's pelvis treatable without surgery?,"Dysphoria related to one's pelvis can manifest in various ways and stem from different underlying causes.  While surgery (such as gender-affirming surgeries) may be an option for some individuals experiencing body dysmorphia related to their pelvis, it's certainly not the only treatment.  Many therapeutic approaches can address pelvic dysphoria without surgical intervention. These include:

* **Therapy:**  Psychotherapy, particularly types like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or gender-affirming therapy, can help individuals process their feelings, challenge negative thoughts about their body, and develop coping mechanisms.  This can significantly alleviate distress related to body image, even without physical changes.

* **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** For transgender individuals, HRT can lead to physical changes that may alleviate dysphoria.  While not directly altering pelvic structure, it can impact fat distribution and other secondary sexual characteristics, contributing to a more congruent body image.

* **Medication:** Certain medications may be helpful in managing associated anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions that worsen dysphoria.

* **Body Image Therapy:** Specific therapies focusing on improving body image and self-esteem can address the negative feelings associated with pelvic dysphoria.


Therefore, while surgery might be a solution for some, it is not the only or necessary treatment for pelvic dysphoria.  Various therapeutic and medical interventions can help manage and alleviate the distress associated with it without requiring surgical procedures.

156,Can United States Secretary of State do crimes in U.K. without being arrested?,"The United States Secretary of State is a high-ranking official, but they are not above the law.  While they may have diplomatic immunity in certain circumstances, this immunity does not extend to all crimes committed in the UK.  If the Secretary of State committed a crime in the UK, for instance, a violent crime or a serious white-collar offense, they would likely be arrested, although diplomatic procedures and potentially negotiations might be involved.  However, the simple fact that they are the Secretary of State doesn't grant them blanket legal protection from arrest and prosecution in a foreign country.

Answer: {false}
"
157,Is myocardial infarction a brain problem?,"Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a condition affecting the heart muscle.  It occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery. This blockage prevents the heart muscle from receiving the oxygen and nutrients it needs, leading to damage or death of the heart tissue.  The brain, on the other hand, is supplied by its own set of arteries and is a completely separate organ.  Therefore, a myocardial infarction is not a brain problem.

"
158,Will Chick Fil A be open on Halloween 2021?,"Chick-fil-A's hours of operation are generally set by individual franchisees and can vary.  While they are typically closed on Sundays, their hours on other days, including holidays like Halloween, are not uniformly fixed. To determine if a specific Chick-fil-A location was open on Halloween 2021, one would need to check the hours for that individual restaurant.  There is no company-wide policy dictating closure on Halloween.

"
159,Was  Godfrey of Bouillon an Islamaphobe?,"Godfrey of Bouillon was a prominent figure in the First Crusade.  While he participated in the conquest of Jerusalem,  there's limited direct evidence to definitively label him an ""Islamophobe"" by modern standards. The concept of Islamophobia as we understand it today didn't exist in the 11th century.  His actions during the crusade were driven by religious fervor and the broader political context of the time, which involved warfare and conflict between different religious groups.  Attributing a modern label like ""Islamophobe"" to a historical figure requires careful consideration and nuanced understanding of the historical context and available evidence.  While he engaged in warfare against Muslims, it's an oversimplification to equate this with modern prejudice.  

Answer: {false}

161,If you add water to rice pudding is it horchata?,"Horchata is a rice-based beverage, but it's not simply rice pudding with water.  Horchata typically includes water, rice, sugar, and cinnamon (and sometimes other spices or flavorings).  Rice pudding, on the other hand, is a cooked dish that includes rice, milk (or cream), sugar, and often other ingredients like vanilla or raisins.  Adding water to rice pudding changes its consistency and might make it thinner, but it wouldn't transform it into horchata because it's still missing crucial flavor components like cinnamon and the specific preparation method.

165,Was Daniel thrown into the lion's den in the New Testament?,"The story of Daniel being thrown into a lion's den is found in the Book of Daniel, which is part of the Old Testament, not the New Testament.  The New Testament begins with the Gospels and focuses on the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The Book of Daniel, however, is a book of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and details the stories of the prophet Daniel during the Babylonian exile.

167,Does the word swastika have meaning in sanskrit?,"The word ""swastika"" is of Sanskrit origin.  In Sanskrit, ""su"" means ""good"" or ""well,"" and ""asti"" means ""it is"" or ""exists.""  Therefore, ""svastika"" literally translates to something like ""it is well"" or ""good being,"" carrying connotations of auspiciousness and well-being.

168,Did Sony definitively win the video game war against Sega?,"The ""video game war"" between Sega and Sony is a complex issue with no single definitive victor. While Sony's PlayStation ultimately achieved significantly greater market share and lasting success than Sega's Saturn and Dreamcast,  Sega's impact on the industry shouldn't be discounted. Sega pushed innovation with its 16-bit Genesis, challenging Nintendo's dominance and influencing the future of game design.  The ""war"" wasn't a simple win-lose scenario; both companies made significant contributions, faced challenges, and ultimately shaped the modern gaming landscape in different ways.  Therefore, declaring a definitive winner is an oversimplification.

While an ethics professor *could* teach a class on Cézanne, it would be highly unusual and likely outside their area of specialization.  A class on Cézanne would typically be taught by an art history professor.  There's no inherent reason why an ethics professor *couldn't* do it, but it's highly improbable.

During the Nazi era, Daimler-Benz profited significantly from contracts to build military vehicles, including trucks and cars used by the Wehrmacht.  They also used forced labor from concentration camps in their factories.  While the company's post-war narrative attempts to distance itself from the regime, historical evidence clearly indicates a substantial and problematic relationship.

* **Source:**  Kidneys from reputable butchers or grocery stores that adhere to food safety regulations are the safest option.  Wild-caught or improperly handled kidneys pose a higher risk of contamination.
* **Preparation:**  Thorough cooking is crucial to eliminate potential pathogens.  Undercooked kidney can harbor harmful bacteria.  The cooking method should ensure the kidney reaches a safe internal temperature.
* **Health Conditions:**  Individuals with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease or gout, may need to limit their kidney consumption.  It is always advisable to consult a doctor or registered dietitian about dietary restrictions related to specific health concerns.

190,Are all Wednesdays in a year enough to read Bible 15 times?,"There are 52 weeks in a year, therefore there are 52 Wednesdays.  If someone reads the Bible 15 times in a year, that means they would need to read the Bible approximately 15/52 = 0.288 times per Wednesday.  Since it's not possible to read a fraction of the Bible, and 0.288 is less than 1, the 52 Wednesdays are sufficient to read the Bible 15 times.  In reality, one could dedicate a few hours a day on those days to accomplish this goal.

Adrenal fatigue is not a medically recognized condition, and its treatment is not supported by scientific research. While Brussels sprouts are a nutritious vegetable containing various vitamins and minerals, there's no indication they specifically target or alleviate the symptoms associated with the purported condition of adrenal fatigue.  Any perceived benefits would likely be due to their general nutritional value.

198,Is Shiva's divine dance an ancient physical fitness pose?,"Shiva's Tandava, or cosmic dance, is a significant motif in Hindu iconography and theology, representing creation and destruction, the cyclical nature of the universe, and the interplay of opposing forces.  While it's depicted in dynamic poses that might inspire certain physical movements, it's not a codified physical fitness pose in the way yoga asanas are.  The dance is primarily a symbolic representation with deep spiritual meaning, not a structured exercise routine from an ancient fitness regime.  The movements portrayed are meant to be interpreted metaphorically, not literally replicated as a workout.

"
200,Did Medieval English lords engage in fair trade with peasants?,"Medieval English lords and peasants operated within a fundamentally unequal system of feudalism.  While some exchanges might have appeared fair on the surface (e.g., a lord offering protection in exchange for labor), the power dynamic heavily favored the lord. Peasants had limited options and were often coerced into unfavorable arrangements.  The concept of ""fair trade"" as we understand it today – implying equal bargaining power and mutually beneficial agreements – didn't exist within the medieval feudal context.  The relationship was largely exploitative, with lords controlling land and resources while peasants were bound to them by obligation.  Therefore, while some transactions may have been superficially equitable, the overall system was anything but fair trade.

Answer: {false}
"
201,Paleography hypothetically helps to understand Cthulhu?,"Paleography is the study of ancient writing systems and handwriting.  Cthulhu, a fictional cosmic entity from H.P. Lovecraft's stories, is not historically documented and therefore doesn't have a written record that paleography could analyze.  While Lovecraft's stories contain fictional languages and inscriptions related to Cthulhu, these are creations of Lovecraft himself and not historical texts that paleography could study.

Answer: {false}
"
202,Have jokes killed more people than rats in history?,"Explanation:

This question requires comparing the death tolls attributed to jokes and rats throughout history.  While it's impossible to definitively quantify deaths caused by ""jokes"" (this could include deaths from heart attacks triggered by laughter, deaths resulting from pranks gone wrong, or even deaths indirectly caused by societal pressures or misinformation spread through humor), it's highly improbable that the number would surpass the vast number of human deaths caused by rats throughout history.  Rats have been vectors for numerous deadly diseases (plague, typhus, etc.) causing pandemics that killed millions.  Therefore, it's extremely unlikely that deaths from jokes, however defined, would come close to the death toll from rats.

Answer: {false}
"
203,Is slitting your wrists an unreliable suicide method?,"Slitting one's wrists is not a reliable method of suicide.  While it can cause significant injury and even death, the process is often slow and painful, and there's a considerable chance of survival, leading to severe disability.  Furthermore, the act itself can be impulsive, and individuals may regret their actions before death occurs.  Medical intervention can be successful in preventing death even after significant self-harm of this nature. Therefore, it is considered unreliable in achieving the intended outcome.

Answer: {true}
"
204,Is the rise of agriculture attributed to rivers?,"The rise of agriculture is strongly linked to the presence of rivers.  Rivers provided a reliable source of water for irrigation, essential for cultivating crops.  The fertile floodplains deposited by rivers also provided rich soil ideal for farming.  The predictable flooding cycles, though sometimes destructive, also replenished the soil's nutrients.  River valleys also offered transportation routes for trade and communication, facilitating the spread of agricultural techniques and practices.  While other factors contributed to the development of agriculture, the availability of water and fertile land near rivers played a crucial role.

Answer: {true}
"
205,Do the Eskimos sunbathe frequently?,"Eskimos, or Inuit, live in regions with limited sunlight, especially during winter months.  Sunbathing, which requires significant sun exposure, would not be a frequent activity for them due to the climate and the potential for sun damage in the limited periods of stronger sunlight. While they might get some sun exposure during summer months, it's unlikely to be a frequent or intentional activity like it is for people in sunnier climates.

Answer: {false}
"
206,Do the telescopes at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex work the night shift?,"The Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex is a radio telescope facility that communicates with spacecraft.

207,Is a thousand dollars per Days of Our Lives episodes preferred to other soaps?,"The question asks if paying $1000 per episode of Days of Our Lives is preferred to other soap operas.  This question is unanswerable without additional information.  The cost per episode is irrelevant to preference.  Preference is subjective and depends on individual viewer tastes, not the production budget or cost per episode.  We need data on viewer preference for Days of Our Lives compared to other soaps. The provided context offers no such data.

"
211,Will Donald Duck hypothetically purchase bell-bottoms for himself?,"Answer: Donald Duck is an anthropomorphic cartoon duck known for his sailor outfit.  Bell-bottoms were a popular fashion trend, particularly in the 1970s. While Donald Duck's clothing style is relatively consistent, there's no inherent reason why he couldn't hypothetically wear bell-bottoms.  The question is about possibility, not established canon.

Answer: {true}
"
212,Do people put creatures from the Black Sea on their pizza?,"The question asks whether people put creatures from the Black Sea on their pizza.  The Black Sea is a body of water known for its diverse marine life, including fish, jellyfish, mollusks, and various other organisms. However, there is no common culinary practice of using Black Sea creatures as pizza toppings. While some cultures use seafood on pizza, it's not typical to specifically use creatures from the Black Sea, and there's no evidence suggesting this is a widespread practice.  Therefore, the answer is likely false.

Answer: {false}
"
213,Are there special traffic laws associated with funerals?,"Many jurisdictions have laws or common practices that grant funeral processions special considerations on the road. These often involve things like allowing the procession to proceed through intersections against red lights (usually with police escort),  allowing the procession to take up more than one lane of traffic, and requiring other drivers to yield the right-of-way.  The specifics vary significantly by location and often depend on the presence of a police escort.  While there isn't a universally codified ""funeral traffic law,"" the general principle is that reasonable accommodations are made to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of the procession.

Answer: {true}
"
214,Can I find my home with latitude and longitude?,"Latitude and longitude coordinates pinpoint a specific location on the Earth's surface.

216,Can you get a fever from consuming meat?,"Explanation: Consuming meat itself does not directly cause a fever.  Fevers are a symptom of the body fighting off infection or illness. While contaminated meat can carry bacteria or viruses (like Salmonella or E. coli) that *can* cause illness and subsequently a fever, the meat itself isn't the source of the fever.  The fever is a response to the infection caused by consuming contaminated meat.

217,Is eating a Dicopomorpha echmepterygis size Uranium pellet fatal?,"The question asks about the lethality of consuming a uranium pellet the size of a Dicopomorpha echmepterygis.  To answer this, we need information on the size of the insect and the toxicity of uranium.

Dicopomorpha echmepterygis is a type of insect. While the exact size can vary, insects of this type are generally small – likely only a few millimeters in length and width.  This means a uranium pellet of the same size would be very small, containing a relatively small amount of uranium.

However, even small amounts of uranium are highly radioactive and toxic. Ingesting uranium can cause acute radiation sickness, kidney damage, and potentially death.  While the exact lethal dose depends on several factors (isotope, solubility, etc.), any ingestion of uranium is extremely dangerous.  A uranium pellet, even a small one, is likely to contain a significant enough quantity of uranium to cause serious health problems and potentially death.

221,Are a dozen pickles good for easing hypertension?,"Answer: There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that a dozen pickles can ease hypertension.  While pickles contain some electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which play a role in blood pressure regulation, the high sodium content in pickles is actually detrimental to individuals with hypertension.  High sodium intake is known to increase blood pressure.  Therefore, consuming a dozen pickles is unlikely to help, and may even worsen, hypertension.

224,Do you need a large room if you want to get into 3D printing?,"The size of the room needed for 3D printing depends heavily on the size and type of 3D printer being used.  Small, desktop 3D printers require very little space, fitting easily on a desk or in a small corner.  However, larger industrial 3D printers, capable of printing significantly larger objects, require much more space – potentially a dedicated room.  Also, factors such as material storage (filaments, resins, etc.), post-processing equipment (sanding, painting, etc.), and ventilation (especially for resin printers) will influence the necessary space. Therefore, while some 3D printing can be done in a small space, it's not universally true.

The show focused on unsolved crimes, disappearances, and supernatural events. The Tower of London's history, while encompassing various mysteries and events, is not directly relevant to the type of mysteries featured on ""Unsolved Mysteries."" The show's focus was on contemporary or relatively recent cases, not historical events of the 15th century.  Therefore, the Tower of London in the 1400s would not have been a topic of interest for Robert Stack's show.

231,Was Donald Trump the target of Islamophobia?,"Donald Trump's presidency was marked by several controversial policies and statements regarding Muslims and immigration.  These included the initial ""Muslim ban"" executive order, which temporarily restricted entry from several Muslim-majority countries.  While the stated rationale was national security, the order faced widespread criticism for its apparent targeting of Muslims.  His rhetoric during the campaign and presidency often used inflammatory language regarding Muslims and Islamic terrorism,  which many perceived as fueling Islamophobia.  While it's impossible to definitively say he was *the target* of Islamophobia, he certainly faced significant criticism and accusations of fostering it through his actions and words. Therefore, the answer is complex and depends on how ""target"" is defined.  However, it's undeniable that his policies and rhetoric contributed to anti-Muslim sentiment, and that he was the subject of much criticism regarding this.

243,Can Ford F-350 tow entire Yale University student body?,"To determine if a Ford F-350 could tow the entire Yale University student body, we need to estimate the weight of the student body and compare it to the towing capacity of the truck.

* **Yale Student Body Weight:** Yale University has approximately 12,000 undergraduate students.  Let's assume an average student weight of 150 pounds (this is a rough estimate, and the actual average could vary).  This gives a total weight of 12,000 students * 150 pounds/student = 1,800,000 pounds.  This doesn't account for graduate students, faculty, or staff, which would significantly increase the total weight.

* **Ford F-350 Towing Capacity:** The towing capacity of a Ford F-350 varies depending on the specific model and configuration.  However, a high-end F-350 might have a maximum towing capacity of around 30,000 pounds.  This is significantly less than the estimated weight of the Yale student body.

Considering the weight of the Yale student body (and the additional weight of graduate students, faculty and staff) is far greater than the towing capacity of even the most powerful Ford F-350, the answer is false.

Answer: {false}

246,Does the Dalai Lama believe in the divine barzakh?,"The Dalai Lama is a Buddhist leader.  Buddhism does not have a concept directly equivalent to the Islamic concept of ""barzakh,"" which is an intermediate state between death and the afterlife.

254,Were all the materials to make a cannon known during the bronze age?,"Explanation:
The Bronze Age is characterized by the use of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin.  Cannons require a metal strong enough to withstand the pressure of gunpowder. Bronze, while stronger than copper alone, is not strong enough for early cannons, which often burst.  While the necessary materials for bronze (copper and tin) were known, the technology to forge a cannon strong enough to withstand the pressure wouldn't be developed until later.  Iron and steel, which are stronger and more suitable, became prevalent much later than the Bronze Age.

256,Would an environmentalist advocate for preventing domestic canine reproduction?,"Environmentalists often advocate for reducing the overall environmental impact of human activities.  Domestic dogs, while beloved companions, contribute to environmental issues through their consumption of resources (food, water, energy for their care), waste production (pet waste), and the carbon footprint associated with their breeding, care, and eventual disposal.  While a blanket ban on dog reproduction is unlikely to be a common environmentalist stance, some might advocate for responsible breeding practices (reducing overall numbers through responsible ownership and spaying/neutering) to mitigate these environmental consequences.  However, this is not a universally held position within the environmentalist movement.  The focus is more on reducing the impact, not necessarily eliminating the animals themselves.

272,Is someone more likely to survive having breast cancer in Japan than in Sweden?,"The question asks whether someone is more likely to survive breast cancer in Japan than in Sweden.  To answer this, we need to compare breast cancer survival rates in both countries.  While readily available, up-to-the-minute data on this fluctuates and requires detailed analysis of epidemiological studies.  There isn't a simple, universally agreed-upon answer that can be given without referencing specific, time-sensitive research papers.  Survival rates are influenced by numerous factors including early detection rates, access to quality healthcare, treatment protocols, and genetic predispositions within populations.  Without access to those specific comparative studies, we cannot definitively say whether survival rates are higher in Japan or Sweden.

"
273,Did Irish mythology inspire Washington Irving?,"Washington Irving, a key figure in American Romanticism, drew inspiration from a wide range of sources, including European folklore and legends.  While he didn't directly incorporate Irish mythology in the same overt way he might have used, say, German folklore, the romantic and supernatural elements prevalent in Irish myths likely resonated with his literary style and thematic concerns.  The sense of mystery, the exploration of the supernatural, and the focus on the past that characterize much of Irish mythology are mirrored in Irving's works, particularly his short stories and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.""  The influence might be indirect, a part of a broader absorption of European romantic traditions, but the shared thematic elements suggest a possible, albeit perhaps subtle, connection.

276,Can a minor replicate the double-slit experiment?,"The double-slit experiment requires a basic understanding of physics concepts, the ability to carefully set up and manipulate equipment, and a method of observing and recording results.  While a minor might grasp the basic conceptual setup, the practical execution poses challenges.

Specifically:

* **Laser safety:** Lasers used in the experiment are potentially dangerous to eyes, requiring adult supervision and safety precautions.  A minor wouldn't be able to safely operate the laser on their own.
* **Precision setup:**  The experiment demands precise alignment of the slits, the laser, and the screen.  Maintaining this precision requires a level of dexterity and attention to detail that might be beyond a young child.
* **Data collection and analysis:**  Accurate measurements of diffraction patterns are needed to demonstrate the wave-particle duality.  This requires a level of understanding of data analysis that might not be present in all minors.
* **Availability of equipment:**  Securing the necessary equipment (laser, slits, screen, etc.) could be challenging.


While an exceptionally intelligent and scientifically inclined minor *might* be capable of executing a simplified version of the experiment with significant adult assistance and oversight, it is unlikely a minor could replicate it independently and accurately.

290,Can any person with a driver's license work in transport of aviation fuel?,"No.  While a driver's license is necessary for many aspects of daily life and some transportation jobs, it doesn't qualify someone to handle the specialized and highly regulated transport of aviation fuel.  Aviation fuel transport requires specific training, certifications, and adherence to strict safety regulations dictated by the aviation industry and relevant governmental agencies.  These regulations go beyond simply driving a vehicle.  They involve handling hazardous materials, understanding safety procedures for refueling aircraft, and potentially operating specialized equipment.

Answer: {false}
"
292,Does open heart surgery finish before entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake?,"Open heart surgery typically takes several hours,  ranging from a few hours to potentially over 10 hours depending on the complexity of the procedure.  American Ballet Theatre's production of Swan Lake is a full-length ballet, generally lasting around 3-4 hours. Therefore, it is plausible that open heart surgery could finish *before* the entirety of Swan Lake is performed, although this is not guaranteed given the variability of both the surgery's duration and the specific production's runtime.

296,Is Antarctica a good location for Groundhog Day?,"Groundhog Day is celebrated in regions with sufficient snow cover and a distinct spring thaw.  Antarctica is almost entirely covered in ice and snow throughout the year, experiencing a very long, harsh winter, and a very short, relatively mild summer.  While there's a change in seasons, the ground is unlikely to thaw sufficiently in a way that would support the tradition of a groundhog emerging from its burrow. Therefore, Antarctica is not a suitable location for Groundhog Day.

Answer: {false}
"
297,Does the density of helium cause voices to sound deeper?,"Helium is less dense than air.  When you inhale helium, your vocal cords vibrate faster because the sound waves travel faster in the less dense medium. This faster vibration results in a higher pitched voice, not a deeper one.

Answer: {false}
"
298,Can petroleum jelly be used as fuel in a car?,"Petroleum jelly, or petrolatum, is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons. While it is derived from petroleum, it is not a refined fuel like gasoline or diesel.  It has a much higher viscosity and a different chemical composition.  Internal combustion engines require a fuel that can be easily atomized and burned efficiently.  Petroleum jelly's thick consistency would prevent it from being properly atomized and ignited in a car engine.  It would likely clog the fuel system and cause significant damage. Therefore, it cannot be used as fuel in a car.

Answer: {false}
"
299,Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?,"The Seven Deadly Sins are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth.  There's no definitive theological or empirical data to definitively determine which sin is ""most prevalent.""  Prevalence would vary across individuals, cultures, and time periods.  While greed might be perceived as highly prevalent in modern materialistic societies, other sins like envy, wrath, or pride could be argued to be equally or even more prevalent depending on the context and individual perspectives. Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say that greed is the most prevalent.

"
300,Is CEO of Nissan an internationally wanted fugitive?,"Carlos Ghosn, the former CEO of Nissan, was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of financial misconduct and subsequently fled to Lebanon in 2019, evading the Japanese legal system.  While he was not initially designated as an ""internationally wanted fugitive"" in the same way as someone with an Interpol Red Notice, his escape and subsequent actions in Lebanon, where he remains,  make him effectively a fugitive from justice, at least from the perspective of the Japanese authorities.  Whether he meets the precise legal definition of ""internationally wanted"" depends on the interpretation of specific legal terminology, but his actions certainly align with the common understanding of the term.

Answer: {true}
"
301,Do drag kings take testosterone to look masculine?,"Drag kings are performers who dress and act in traditionally masculine ways. While some drag kings might use testosterone or other hormone replacement therapies to enhance their masculine appearance, it's not a requirement or a universal practice.  Many achieve a masculine look through other means, such as makeup, costuming, padding, and performance techniques.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say all or most drag kings use testosterone.

303,Would Paul Bunyan hypothetically be a poor choice for an urban planner?,"Paul Bunyan is a mythical lumberjack of immense size and strength, known for his feats of deforestation and earth-moving.  Urban planning requires a nuanced understanding of city systems, population density, resource management, and sustainable development.  Paul Bunyan's legendary actions, while impressive on a grand scale, would likely be incredibly destructive and impractical within a densely populated urban environment.  His methods are incompatible with modern urban planning principles,  focused on conservation, efficient use of space, and consideration for the environment and human well-being.

Answer: {true}
"
304,Can sunlight travel to the deepest part of the Black Sea?,"The Black Sea's maximum depth is approximately 7,250 feet (2,210 meters).  Sunlight penetration in water is limited due to absorption and scattering by water molecules and other substances.  The depth to which sunlight can penetrate depends on factors like the clarity of the water and the angle of the sun.  While some light might penetrate to a few hundred meters in very clear water, it's highly unlikely that significant sunlight would reach the deepest parts of the Black Sea.  The deeper waters would be essentially lightless.

"
308,Is Thanksgiving sometimes considered a day of mourning?,"Thanksgiving, a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada, commemorates the harvest and other blessings of the past year.  However, for many Native Americans, it is also a day of mourning, remembering the displacement, violence, and cultural destruction inflicted upon their ancestors following European colonization.  The holiday's origins are intertwined with the devastating impact of colonization on Indigenous populations, a historical reality often overlooked in mainstream celebrations. Therefore, it is accurate to say that Thanksgiving is sometimes considered a day of mourning.

"
310,Is Noah's Ark an upgrade for Golden Age of Piracy pirates?,"Noah's Ark is a biblical vessel built to save animals from a great flood.  The Golden Age of Piracy refers to a period of widespread piracy, primarily in the Caribbean, from roughly the 1650s to the 1730s.  These are entirely separate and unrelated historical concepts.  A pirate ship would not be considered an ""upgrade"" to Noah's Ark, nor vice versa.  They serve completely different purposes and exist in vastly different contexts.

Answer: {false}
"
311,Are two cans of Campbell's Soup a day good for hypertension?,"Answer: Campbell's soup, especially cream-based varieties, is often high in sodium.  High sodium intake is a major contributor to hypertension (high blood pressure).  Consuming two cans daily would significantly increase sodium intake, likely worsening hypertension rather than improving it.  Therefore, two cans of Campbell's Soup a day is not good for hypertension.

Answer: {false}

314,Can a sniper shoot a fish past Bathypelagic Zone in ocean?,"The bathypelagic zone is the part of the ocean between 1,000 and 4,000 meters (3,300 and 13,100 feet) deep.  A sniper, even with an extremely powerful rifle, would not have the range to shoot a fish at such a depth.  The bullet's trajectory would be affected by gravity and water resistance, making it impossible to hit a target that far away, especially one in a dynamic environment like the ocean.  Furthermore, the water pressure at such depths is immense, causing significant drag on the projectile.

Answer: {false}
"
315,Were Depeche Mode heavily influenced by blues music?,"Depeche Mode's music is primarily categorized as synth-pop and electronic.  While some individual members may have had personal exposure to blues music, their overall sound and songwriting don't prominently feature blues influences.  Their music relies heavily on synthesizers, drum machines, and a distinct electronic production style, which contrasts sharply with the characteristics of blues music. Therefore, it's inaccurate to say they were heavily influenced by blues music.

Answer: {false}
"
316,Do you need lactobacillus to make pickles?,"Lactobacillus is a genus of bacteria that are essential for the fermentation process that makes pickles.  During fermentation, lactobacillus converts sugars in the cucumbers into lactic acid, creating the characteristic sour taste and preserving the pickles.  While other bacteria may be involved, lactobacillus is a key player, and its absence would significantly impact the pickling process.

"
317,Did King James I despise fairy beings?,"There's no historical evidence suggesting King James I had strong feelings, positive or negative, specifically towards fairy beings. While he was known for his interest in witchcraft and demonology (as evidenced by his book *Daemonologie*), this focused on what he considered harmful supernatural entities.  Fairy beings, as depicted in folklore, weren't typically categorized in the same way.  His writings and actions don't directly address fairies. Therefore, we can't definitively say he despised them, nor can we say he liked them; there is a lack of information.

Answer: {false}
"
318,Is dyslexia the most common intellectual disability in US?,"Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that primarily affects reading and related language-based skills.  Intellectual disability, on the other hand, is a significantly broader term encompassing limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. While dyslexia is a common learning disability, it's not an intellectual disability in the clinical sense.  There are many other conditions that fall under the umbrella of intellectual disability, and some of these are more prevalent than dyslexia.  Therefore, dyslexia is not the most common intellectual disability in the US.

Answer: {false}
"
319,Do Bing (search engine) searches earn the searcher more than competitors do?,"Bing's market share is significantly smaller than Google's.  While Bing does offer rewards programs and points for searches, these programs are unlikely to generate significantly more revenue for a searcher compared to simply using Google. Google's vast scale and dominance in search mean it's extremely difficult for any competitor to offer a superior financial reward scheme that would offset the convenience and other features Google provides.  Furthermore, there's no publicly available data indicating that Bing's rewards program delivers more monetary value to users than the total value derived from using Google's features and services.

321,Did the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the U.S. in 1908 watch TV?,"The 1908 Democratic Party nominee for President of the U.S. was William Jennings Bryan.  Television was not invented in 1908.  The first public demonstration of television technology occurred in 1927,  and it would be many years before television was widely available to the general public.  Therefore, William Jennings Bryan could not have watched television.

Answer: {false}
"
322,Was Great Recession the period of severest unemployment?,"The Great Recession, which officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, saw a significant spike in unemployment rates across many countries, particularly in the United States.  However, determining whether it represents the *severest* period of unemployment requires comparing it to other historical economic downturns.  The severity of unemployment can be measured in several ways, including the peak unemployment rate, the duration of high unemployment, and the overall impact on the labor force.  While the Great Recession led to a substantial increase in unemployment, other periods, such as the Great Depression, experienced far higher rates and longer durations of unemployment.  Therefore, while the Great Recession was a period of severe unemployment, it wasn't necessarily the *severest* in history.

Answer: {false}

324,Would a week be enough time to watch every episode of Ugly Betty?,"Ugly Betty has 4 seasons, with each season containing roughly 20-24 episodes.  This totals approximately 80-96 episodes.  Assuming an average episode length of 45 minutes, watching all episodes would take between 60 and 72 hours. A week has 168 hours.  Therefore, there is sufficient time within a week to watch all episodes of Ugly Betty, even accounting for sleep and other activities.

326,Was Pi an acceptable number of children in 1980s China?,"Answer: The one-child policy in China was implemented in 1979 and lasted until 2015.  This policy limited most families to having only one child.  Pi (π) is approximately 3.14, which is greater than 1. Therefore, having Pi children would not have been acceptable under the Chinese one-child policy of the 1980s.

Answer: {false}
"
327,Can surgery prevent an existential crisis?,"Surgery addresses physical ailments. Existential crises are philosophical and emotional struggles related to one's purpose, meaning, and place in the universe.  These are internal, psychological issues that cannot be directly addressed by physical interventions like surgery. While surgery might alleviate physical pain that contributes to a person's overall unhappiness and indirectly impact their emotional state, it cannot resolve the core concerns of an existential crisis.  Therefore, surgery is not a preventative measure against an existential crisis.

Answer: {false}

"
330,Is Snow White an example of good consent?,"Snow White's story does not depict good consent.  The narrative centers on a kiss from a prince while Snow White is asleep and unconscious.  This act, even if well-intentioned, is non-consensual as Snow White is unable to give her consent while in this state.  Therefore, the story presents a harmful and inaccurate portrayal of consent.

Answer: {false}
"
331,Is The Invisible Man more prevalent in films than Picnic at Hanging Rock?,"The Invisible Man has been adapted into numerous films across various decades, starting from early cinema to modern times.  Picnic at Hanging Rock, while a significant and critically acclaimed film, and having had some subsequent adaptations, has far fewer film adaptations than The Invisible Man.  The sheer number of versions of The Invisible Man makes it significantly more prevalent in film.

Answer: {true}
"
332,Could Ryan Crouser throw a bengal fox with ease?,"Ryan Crouser is a highly accomplished shot putter, known for his exceptional strength and power.  A Bengal fox, while not a particularly large animal, still possesses a significant amount of weight and would not be easily tossed.  While Crouser is incredibly strong, throwing a live animal would involve ethical concerns and is not something that could be done with ease. The act itself would likely be dangerous for both the athlete and the animal.

Answer: {false}
"
333,Did Amy Winehouse always perform live perfectly?,"Amy Winehouse was known for her incredible vocal talent but also for her struggles with substance abuse and erratic behavior.  These issues often impacted her live performances, leading to inconsistent and sometimes flawed performances. While she could deliver breathtakingly beautiful and powerful performances, she wasn't known for consistent perfection.  Therefore, it is not accurate to say she *always* performed perfectly live.

Answer: {false}

"
335,Do Chinese Americans face discrimination at a Federal level in the US?,"Answer: While there isn't a single, explicit federal law that directly discriminates against Chinese Americans,  a history of discriminatory legislation and ongoing issues with racial bias in various federal institutions suggest that indirect and systemic discrimination exists.  The Chinese Exclusion Act, while no longer in effect, represents a historical example of explicit federal-level discrimination.  Even today, issues such as racial profiling, unequal access to opportunities, and underrepresentation in federal positions point to systemic challenges faced by Chinese Americans within the federal sphere.  Therefore, while not overt, the cumulative effect points to the presence of discrimination.

Answer: {true}

338,Was King Kong (2005 film) the lead actress's biggest box office role?,"The 2005 film King Kong starred Naomi Watts as the lead actress.  To determine if this was her biggest box office role, we need to compare the box office gross of King Kong to her other films.  While a definitive answer requires checking the box office gross of all her films, a quick search reveals that some of her films, such as *The Impossible* and *Mulholland Drive*, likely exceeded *King Kong*'s box office returns.

"
344,Does frost mean that it will be a snowy day?,"Frost forms when the temperature of surfaces drops below freezing (0°C or 32°F), causing water vapor in the air to deposit as ice crystals.  While frost indicates freezing temperatures, it doesn't necessarily mean it will snow.  Snow requires the presence of clouds containing water droplets or ice crystals that are heavy enough to fall to the ground as precipitation.  Frost can occur on clear nights with calm winds and low humidity, even when there are no clouds present to produce snow.

350,Are all students guaranteed lunch at school in the US?,"The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) provides subsidized lunches to students from low-income families.  However, this program doesn't guarantee a free lunch for *all* students in the US.  Many students from families who are not considered low-income pay for their lunches.  Therefore, while a significant portion of students receive subsidized or free lunches, not all students are guaranteed a free lunch at school.

351,Would a stool be useful for a Lusotitan to reach the top of an almond tree?,"Lusotitan is a genus of large sauropod dinosaur.  Sauropods were enormous, reaching lengths of up to 30 meters or more. Almond trees are relatively small, typically reaching heights of no more than 10 meters. Even a small stool would be negligible in height compared to the height of a Lusotitan. A Lusotitan would not need a stool to reach the top of an almond tree.

Answer: {False}
"
353,Does the cuisine of Hawaii embrace foods considered gross in the continental US?,"Hawaiian cuisine incorporates a variety of ingredients and dishes that might be considered unusual or unappetizing by some people in the continental U.S.  For example, poi (a paste made from taro root) has a unique texture and flavor that some find off-putting.  Similarly, some might find the inclusion of raw fish in dishes like poke to be less appealing than cooked meats.  The use of organs, such as luau, also sets it apart from some continental US palettes.  However, it is important to note that taste is subjective, and what one person finds gross another might find delicious.  The statement is somewhat subjective but, considering the differences in taste and palates, some dishes found common in Hawaiian Cuisine might be considered gross by some in the continental US.

Answer: {true}
"
356,Is it legal for a licensed child driving Mercedes-Benz to be employed in US?,"The question asks whether it is legal for a licensed child driving a Mercedes-Benz to be employed in the US.  Several factors need consideration:

* **Driving Age:**  The minimum driving age varies by state in the US, but it's generally 16 or 18.  A child with a driver's license is, therefore, at least 16 years old.
* **Working Age:** Federal child labor laws exist. While there are exceptions for certain jobs, most children under 16 are limited in the types of work they can legally do, and the number of hours they can work.  16- and 17-year-olds also have restrictions.
* **Type of Employment:** The type of job would also matter.  A child driving a Mercedes-Benz implies a job requiring driving, potentially involving transportation of goods or people.  This raises concerns about licensing requirements and safety regulations applicable to commercial driving, even if the child is above the minimum driving age.

Considering these factors, it is highly improbable that a child, even with a driver's license and driving a Mercedes-Benz, would be legally employed in most circumstances in the US due to child labor laws and potentially other employment regulations. The ownership of a luxury car like a Mercedes-Benz has no bearing on legality of employment.

Answer: {false}
"
357,Would it be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition?,"An Iwato scale is a specific type of musical scale, a heptatonic (seven-note) scale with a characteristic intervallic structure.  Twelve-tone technique, on the other hand, is a compositional method that uses all twelve notes of the chromatic scale (without a tonal center) in a specific order (a tone row) and its various transformations (inversion, retrograde, retrograde inversion).  The inherent structure of the Iwato scale, being a seven-note scale, conflicts fundamentally with the twelve-tone technique's requirement of using all twelve notes.  You cannot derive a twelve-tone row from only seven notes, nor can you effectively use a limited seven-note scale within a system designed to avoid tonal hierarchies based on a limited subset of the twelve chromatic notes.

Answer: {true}

358,Would Stephen King fans be likely to own an image of a clown?,"Stephen King's works frequently feature terrifying clowns, most notably Pennywise in ""IT"".  Therefore, it's plausible that some Stephen King fans might own an image of a clown, either as a piece of memorabilia related to his works or simply as a piece of art they find appealing, even if it's a creepy clown.  However, it's not guaranteed that all or even most Stephen King fans would own such an image.

361,Did the band Led Zeppelin own a prime number of gilded gramophones?,"The question asks whether Led Zeppelin owned a prime number of gilded gramophones.  To answer this, we need information about how many gilded gramophones Led Zeppelin owned.  This information is not readily available and would require extensive research into Led Zeppelin's history and possessions.  Without that information, we cannot definitively say whether the number of gilded gramophones they owned is a prime number.  Therefore, the answer is unknown.

Answer: {unknown}
"
362,Would Robert Wadlow tower over a German Shepherd?,"Robert Wadlow was the tallest man in recorded history, reaching a height of 8 feet 11 inches (2.72 meters).  German Shepherds typically range in height from 22 to 26 inches (56 to 66 centimeters) at the shoulder.  Therefore, Robert Wadlow would be significantly taller than a German Shepherd.

363,Can 200 men end to end cover Great Pyramid of Giza's base?,"The Great Pyramid of Giza has a base of approximately 756 feet (230 meters) per side.  To determine if 200 men, end-to-end, could cover this distance, we need to estimate the average length of a man.  A reasonable estimate is 6 feet (approximately 1.8 meters).

200 men * 6 feet/man = 1200 feet

Since 1200 feet is significantly greater than 756 feet, 200 men standing end-to-end would easily cover the base of the Great Pyramid.

368,Is the Fibonacci number sequence longer than every number discovered in Pi?,"The Fibonacci sequence is an infinitely long sequence of numbers.  Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.  It continues indefinitely: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

Pi (π), on the other hand, is a single number, albeit one with an infinitely long decimal expansion. While trillions of digits of pi have been calculated,  it's a single number, not a sequence.  The digits of pi, no matter how many are discovered, can't be considered ""longer"" than the infinitely long sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

"
369,Is average number of peas in a pod enough commas for a billion?,"Here's how to solve this:

1. **Determine the average number of peas in a pod:**  This varies greatly depending on the pea variety and growing conditions.  Let's assume a conservative average of 6 peas per pod for the sake of calculation.

2. **Calculate how many pods are needed for a billion peas:** A billion (1,000,000,000) peas divided by 6 peas/pod equals approximately 166,666,667 pods.

3. **Consider the number of commas:**  A billion is written as 1,000,000,000, containing two commas.  The number of pods (166,666,667) also contains two commas.

Therefore, the number of peas in the average pod (6) is not relevant to the number of commas in a billion.  The number of commas depends on the number formatting of the billion.  Both the billion and the calculated number of pods have the same number of commas.

373,Will Ronda Rousey hypothetically defeat X-Men's Colossus in a fight?,"Explanation:
Ronda Rousey is a highly skilled mixed martial artist and former UFC champion.  Colossus, from the X-Men, is a fictional character with superhuman strength, durability, and size.  While Rousey is exceptionally strong and skilled for a human, Colossus's powers place him in a completely different category.  Colossus's strength and near invulnerability would make him virtually unbeatable by any human combatant.  Therefore, it is highly improbable that Ronda Rousey could defeat Colossus.

Answer: {false}
"
374,Can DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?,"To answer this question, we need information about the speed of the DRL Racer X drone and the distance of the Brooklyn Bridge.  The length of the Brooklyn Bridge's main span is approximately 1,595.5 feet.  To travel that distance in 18 seconds, the drone would need to travel at an average speed of approximately 53 feet per second (1595.5 feet / 18 seconds ≈ 88.6 feet per second). This is roughly 36 miles per hour (88.6 feet/second * 3600 seconds/hour / 5280 feet/mile).  While DRL Racer X drones are very fast, achieving speeds exceeding 100mph,  whether it can maintain that speed for the entire length of the bridge, accounting for turns, and accounting for possible wind resistance is uncertain without precise data on its sustained speed and handling capabilities.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say if it can cross in 18 seconds.  Further information is needed.

"
375,Can photography be considered abstract art?,"Photography, while often used to represent reality, can be considered abstract art when the photographer manipulates the image in ways that move away from literal representation.  Techniques like blurring, unusual angles, selective focus, unconventional printing methods, and digital manipulation can transform a photograph into an exploration of form, color, texture, and light, rather than a straightforward depiction of a subject.  Abstract photography prioritizes the visual experience over narrative or documentary accuracy.  Therefore, depending on the photographer's intent and the techniques employed, photography can indeed be categorized as abstract art.

376,Could a giant squid fit aboard the deck of the titanic?,"The Titanic's deck was approximately 175 feet wide at its widest point.  Giant squids can grow to lengths of up to 43 feet, but their bodies are relatively slender and their tentacles are long and flexible.  While a giant squid's overall length might be longer than 43 feet, its bulk wouldn't occupy a huge amount of deck space. Therefore, it's plausible that a giant squid could fit on the deck of the Titanic, even if it would likely be a tight squeeze and require careful positioning.

388,Is 3D printing able to make adenovirus?,"3D printing, in its current state, is an additive manufacturing technology that builds objects layer by layer from a digital design.  It manipulates physical materials like plastics, metals, and ceramics.  Adenoviruses, however, are complex biological entities composed of genetic material (DNA or RNA) encased in a protein shell.  The process of creating a virus requires intricate biological processes and specialized equipment not available within the scope of current 3D printing capabilities.  While 3D printing could potentially be used to create structures *that mimic* the shape of a virus, this would not be a functional, infectious adenovirus.

392,Is Eid al-Fitr holiday inappropriate to watch entire US Office?,"Eid al-Fitr is a significant religious holiday for Muslims, often involving prayer, family gatherings, and festive meals.  Watching an entire season of a sitcom like *The Office* might be considered inappropriate for some Muslims during Eid al-Fitr because it could detract from the spiritual and family-oriented aspects of the holiday.  It's a matter of personal preference and prioritization, but for many Muslims, spending Eid al-Fitr in a manner consistent with religious and cultural observances would take precedence over extended periods of television viewing.  Therefore, it's not inherently inappropriate, but it could be for some individuals.

Answer: {true}
"
393,"Can you fit every resident of Auburn, New York, in Tropicana Field?","To determine if all residents of Auburn, New York can fit into Tropicana Field, we need to compare the population of Auburn with the seating capacity of Tropicana Field.

* **Population of Auburn, NY:**  According to recent estimates, the population of Auburn, NY is approximately 27,000 people.  This number can fluctuate slightly depending on the source and year.

* **Seating Capacity of Tropicana Field:** Tropicana Field, a multi-purpose stadium, has a seating capacity that varies depending on the event.  For baseball games, the capacity is usually around 31,000.  For other events, it can be higher or lower, depending on the configuration.


Since the seating capacity of Tropicana Field (around 31,000) is greater than the population of Auburn, NY (approximately 27,000), it's reasonable to conclude that all residents of Auburn could theoretically fit inside Tropicana Field.  We are assuming a reasonably comfortable seating arrangement, and not accounting for space needed for other facilities within the stadium.

"
395,Were there greater landslides than 1980 United States presidential election?,"The question asks if there were greater landslides than the 1980 United States presidential election.  To answer this, we need to define ""landslide"" in the context of US presidential elections.  A landslide is generally considered a victory by a very large margin, often exceeding 15-20% of the popular vote or a significant number of electoral college votes.

The 1980 election saw Ronald Reagan defeat Jimmy Carter by a significant margin, both in the popular vote (around 10%) and the Electoral College (489 to 49). While this was a substantial victory, it's necessary to compare it to other presidential elections to determine if it qualifies as one of the *greatest* landslides. Several elections throughout US history featured even larger margins of victory.  For example, some consider the 1820 election of James Monroe a landslide, the 1920 election of Warren G. Harding another, and the 1936 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt yet another.  These elections often saw much higher percentages of the popular vote and Electoral College votes going to the winner.

"
397,Could Tom Cruise explain mental auditing?,"Tom Cruise, a prominent Scientologist, could potentially explain mental auditing from the perspective of Scientology.  Scientology's auditing is a process where a trained auditor uses an e-meter (a type of galvanometer) to help a person confront and resolve negative experiences or ""engrams"" that are believed to be stored in the reactive mind, affecting their present-day life.  The goal is to achieve a state of ""clear,"" which is considered a higher state of being free from negative mental influences. However, it's important to note that Scientology's practices and beliefs are not scientifically validated and are considered by many to be a pseudoscience or even a cult.  Therefore, his explanation would be based on Scientology's specific tenets and terminology.  While he could explain the *process* as understood within Scientology, his explanation would not align with established scientific or psychological understanding of the mind.

Before his first term was Ramsay MacDonald (1924) and after his last term was Neville Chamberlain (1937-1940).  Neither Ramsay MacDonald nor Neville Chamberlain were women.  Therefore, there was no woman Prime Minister directly before or after any of Stanley Baldwin's terms.

407,Do some religions look forward to armageddon?,"Some branches of Christianity, particularly certain evangelical and fundamentalist groups, interpret biblical prophecies to anticipate an event often referred to as Armageddon, which involves a final battle between good and evil before the establishment of a new heaven and earth.  Other religions, however, don't share this apocalyptic view or have different interpretations of similar end-times prophecies.  Therefore, while some religions do look forward to an event that could be considered analogous to Armageddon, it's not a universal belief across all faiths.

409,Would a Yeti be likely to have prehensile limbs?,"Yetis, also known as Abominable Snowmen, are legendary creatures said to inhabit the Himalayas.  There's no scientific evidence of their existence, and descriptions vary widely. However, most depictions portray them as large, bipedal apes or ape-like humanoids.  Primates, such as apes, often have prehensile limbs (able to grasp), but it's not a defining characteristic of all primates, and not all primates are prehensile.  Since a Yeti's existence is unproven and its exact characteristics are unknown, it's impossible to definitively say whether it would have prehensile limbs.  However, given the common depictions of Yetis as ape-like,  it's plausible that they *might* have prehensile limbs. But this is speculation based on fictional representations, not scientific fact.

410,Can the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change be held at the Javits Center?,"The Javits Center is a large convention center in New York City.  The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a large international conference that requires a substantial amount of space to accommodate delegates, exhibitors, and associated events. While the Javits Center is large, the UNFCCC conferences are typically held in locations that can accommodate even larger numbers of people and associated logistical requirements.  The UNFCCC COP conferences, in particular, have a significantly larger scale and international scope which would be challenging for the Javits Center to manage.  Therefore, it's unlikely the Javits Center would be a suitable venue for a full UNFCCC conference.

411,Did Operation Barbarossa or Barbarossa's last expedition succeed?,"Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ultimately failed.  While the initial German advances were significant, the vastness of the Soviet Union, the resilience of the Red Army, the harsh Russian winter, and ultimately the combined might of the Allied powers led to the defeat of Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front.  Therefore, neither Operation Barbarossa nor any subsequent German expeditions related to it can be considered successful in achieving their primary strategic goals.

415,Could Amazon afford The Mona Lisa?,"Here's an explanation to determine if Amazon could afford the Mona Lisa:

To answer this question, we need to consider two factors:  Amazon's net worth and the estimated value of the Mona Lisa.  The Mona Lisa's value is impossible to definitively state, as it's priceless in the sense it's a national treasure of France and would never likely be sold. However, its *insurance value* is exceptionally high, often cited in the billions of dollars.  Amazon, meanwhile, has a net worth in the trillions of dollars.  Even considering the highest estimates for insurance purposes and the fact that the Mona Lisa is technically not ""for sale,"" Amazon's net worth vastly exceeds any conceivable cost that would be asked.

416,Will a celibate cleric likely suffer a stoning in Somalia?,"Somalia is a country with a predominantly Muslim population, and some interpretations of Islamic law prescribe stoning as a punishment for adultery.  While a celibate cleric would not be committing adultery, there's a chance they could still be targeted for stoning if they are perceived as violating other conservative societal norms or religious interpretations, even if unrelated to sexual behavior.  This is due to the potential for misinterpretations, religious extremism, or even entirely unrelated conflicts that could lead to violence.  Therefore, while it's not the most likely outcome, it's not impossible.

418,Did King of Portuguese people in 1515 have familial ties to the Tudors?,"To determine if the King of Portugal in 1515 had familial ties to the Tudors, we need to identify the Portuguese king and examine the Tudor family tree.

In 1515, Manuel I was the King of Portugal.  The Tudor dynasty in England began with Henry VII in 1485.  To find a connection, we'd need to research the family trees of both Manuel I and the Tudors, looking for common ancestors.  Extensive genealogical research is required to definitively confirm or deny a relationship.  While it's *possible* a connection exists through intermarriage among European royalty, it's not readily apparent from basic historical knowledge.  Without that specific research, a definitive answer cannot be given.

Answer: {Unknown}

422,Was the father of social security system serving in the white house during the Panic of 1907?,"The Panic of 1907 occurred in 1907.  The Social Security Act, which established the Social Security system, was signed into law in 1935.  Therefore, the person who is considered the ""father"" of the Social Security system (generally attributed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt) could not have been serving in the White House during the Panic of 1907.

"
426,Would an Evander Holyfield 2020 boxing return set age record?,"Evander Holyfield's age in 2020 would be a relevant factor in determining if a boxing return would set an age record.  To answer this definitively requires knowing the age record for professional boxers at the time of a potential return and Holyfield's age in 2020.  Publicly available information indicates that Holyfield was born on October 19, 1962. In 2020, he would have been 57 years old. While there might be older boxers who have fought professionally, without precise data on the oldest boxer to compete professionally, we cannot definitively say if a 2020 return would be a record.

The sternum (breastbone) is not directly connected to any of these bones in the way that the bones listed in the song are connected to each other in a linear fashion.  While the sternum connects to the ribs, and the ribs indirectly connect to the vertebrae (backbone), it's not a direct connection as implied in the song's structure.

430,Does Buddy The Elf know anyone who works in publishing?,"The movie ""Elf"" depicts Buddy's journey to New York City to find his father.  While the film focuses on his father, Walter Hobbs, who works in publishing, it doesn't explicitly state whether Buddy knows *anyone else* who works in publishing.  The film focuses primarily on his relationship with his father and the resulting family dynamics. There is no indication of him interacting with other people in the publishing industry.

"
433,Could Oprah Winfrey buy dozens of her staff Bugatti luxury cars?,"Oprah Winfrey is a very wealthy individual.  Bugatti luxury cars are extremely expensive, costing millions of dollars each.  Even if ""dozens"" is a relatively small number, the combined cost would still likely be in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.  While Oprah's net worth is exceptionally high, purchasing that many Bugattis for her staff would represent a significant fraction of her fortune. However, it's not impossible given her wealth.  Therefore, considering her wealth, it is plausible she could afford this.

437,Would a viewer of Monday Night Football be able to catch WWE Raw during commercial breaks?,"Explanation:
Monday Night Football and WWE Raw are typically broadcast on different channels and at different times.  Monday Night Football airs on ESPN or ABC, while WWE Raw airs on USA Network.  While the exact timing can vary slightly depending on the year and specific circumstances, they generally do not overlap significantly.  Even if there were a brief overlap, the length of commercial breaks during a football game are usually not long enough to allow for watching a significant portion of Raw.  Therefore, catching a substantial part of WWE Raw during commercial breaks of Monday Night Football is unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
438,Were the first missionaries required to attend mass on Sundays?,"The question asks whether the first missionaries were required to attend Mass on Sundays.  To answer this, we need to consider the historical context.  The concept of a standardized Sunday Mass, as practiced by the Catholic Church, developed over time. Early missionaries, particularly those from the early centuries of Christianity, faced diverse circumstances and practices.  There wouldn't have been a universally enforced requirement of attending Mass on a Sunday as we understand it today. Their practices and observances would have varied according to local customs, the specific religious order they belonged to (if any), and the availability of organized church services in their mission locations.

440,Is the use of the word Gypsy by non-Romani people considered okay?,"The term ""Gypsy"" is considered a slur by the Romani people.  It has a long history of being used to marginalize and denigrate the Romani community, often associated with negative stereotypes and prejudices. While some may use the term unknowingly or without malicious intent, its use by non-Romani people is widely considered offensive and inappropriate.  Respectful and accurate terminology, such as ""Roma"" or ""Romani,"" should be used instead.

"
441,Did Robert Downey Jr. possess same caliber gun as Resident Evil's Barry Burton?,"To answer this question, we need to determine the type of gun Barry Burton uses in Resident Evil and the type of gun Robert Downey Jr. has been shown to use in movies or publicly.  If they match, the answer is true; if not, it's false.  Unfortunately, without specifying a particular movie or appearance for Robert Downey Jr., this question cannot be definitively answered. Barry Burton's gun is typically a Colt Python, a .357 Magnum revolver.  Robert Downey Jr. has portrayed various characters using various firearms throughout his career.  Without specifying a particular role, we can't confirm a match.

Answer: {true}
"
444,Do depressed people travel to the Golden Gate Bridge often?,"The Golden Gate Bridge is a well-known location for suicide attempts.  While it's not accurate to say *depressed people* frequently travel there, the bridge is unfortunately a destination for individuals experiencing suicidal ideation, a symptom that can be associated with depression.  It's important to note this is not the only location for such events, and not all depressed individuals will travel to the Golden Gate Bridge.  The correlation isn't definitive, but there's a statistically relevant connection between the bridge and suicide attempts, which are related to depression in many cases.


Answer: {true}
"
445,Is the letter D influenced by the shape of ancient doors?,"The letter D's shape is derived from the ancient Greek letter Delta (Δ), which itself is thought to represent a stylized triangle. While ancient doors could have triangular elements in their construction or overall shape, there's no direct etymological link establishing the letter D's form as being directly influenced by the shape of ancient doors. The triangular shape, which is fundamental to the letter D's form, has a broader history and symbolism in various ancient cultures than just the shape of doors.

Answer: {false}
"
446,Did Methuselah live at least 800 years as long as Sarah?,"The question asks if Methuselah lived at least 800 years longer than Sarah.  We need to find the lifespans of both Methuselah and Sarah from the Bible.

According to the Bible, Methuselah lived 969 years.  Sarah's lifespan is given as 127 years.

To determine if Methuselah lived at least 800 years longer than Sarah, we subtract Sarah's lifespan from Methuselah's:

969 years (Methuselah) - 127 years (Sarah) = 842 years

Since 842 is greater than 800, the answer is true.

"
447,Would a triples tandem bike support Apollo 15 crew?,"A triples tandem bike is designed to carry three people.  The Apollo 15 crew consisted of three astronauts: David Scott, Alfred Worden, and James Irwin. Therefore, a triples tandem bike could theoretically support the Apollo 15 crew in terms of weight capacity.  However, this assumes the bike is robust enough to handle the weight of three adult men in spacesuits, and is of course impractical and unsafe.  The question asks for support, not practicality or safety.

Answer: {true}
"
448,Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?,"Answer: Dogs are domesticated animals that are trained to respond to various stimuli, including bells, through classical conditioning.

"
451,Is Nicole Kidman ideal choice to play Psylocke based on height and weight?,"Psylocke, a Marvel Comics character, is depicted as tall and slender.  While exact heights and weights aren't consistently specified across different comic book iterations and adaptations, she's generally portrayed as significantly taller than average.  Nicole Kidman's height and weight are publicly available and readily searchable.  Comparing Kidman's measurements to the general portrayal of Psylocke would determine whether her physique aligns with the character's visual representation.  If Kidman's height and weight are notably different from the typical depiction of Psylocke, then she would not be an ideal choice based on those physical attributes alone.  Further considerations like acting ability and overall suitability for the role would still be relevant, but this question focuses specifically on height and weight.


Answer: {false}
"
452,Would a bodybuilder enjoy wearing a cast for several weeks?,"Answer: A bodybuilder's lifestyle centers around physical training and maintaining muscle mass and strength.  Wearing a cast immobilizes a limb, preventing exercise and potentially leading to muscle atrophy.

"
454,Does Adobe Suite have video game engine coding?,"Adobe Suite is a collection of software applications for graphic design, video editing, web development, and other creative tasks.  While it includes powerful tools for visual effects and animation, it does not directly provide the core functionality of a video game engine such as physics simulation, 3D rendering optimized for real-time gameplay, scripting languages specifically designed for game logic, and networking capabilities for multiplayer games.  While some aspects of Adobe software could be *used* in the process of creating a video game (e.g., Photoshop for textures, After Effects for cinematic sequences), it does not contain a built-in game engine.

Answer: {false}
"
455,Would 1943-S penny be good for making silverware?,"A 1943-S penny is made of steel, not silver.  Silverware is typically made from silver or other metals like stainless steel, but not steel pennies.  Therefore, it would not be suitable for making silverware.

"
458,Could you make the kitchen 'holy trinity' without celery?,"The culinary ""holy trinity"" typically consists of onions, celery, and bell peppers (often green) in roughly equal proportions.  Omitting celery would still allow for a flavorful base, but it would alter the texture and slightly the overall taste.  The resulting mixture wouldn't be a *true* holy trinity, but it would still function as a fragrant and flavorful base for many dishes.

Answer: {true}
"
459,Do white blood cells outnumber red blood cells in the human body?,"The number of red blood cells in the human body significantly outnumbers the number of white blood cells.  A typical adult has about 5 million red blood cells per microliter of blood, while white blood cells are present in much smaller numbers (around 7,000 per microliter).  Therefore, red blood cells are far more numerous than white blood cells.

Answer: {false}
"
460,Can you swim to Miami from New York?,"The distance between New York City and Miami is approximately 1,200 miles.  Swimming that distance is impossible for a human being due to the vast distance, the physical limitations of human endurance, and the dangers of the open ocean, including currents, marine life, and exposure to the elements.

Answer: {false}
"
461,Gandalf hypothetically defeats Rincewind in a wizard battle?,"Explanation:
The question asks whether Gandalf could hypothetically defeat Rincewind in a wizard battle.  This is a matter of opinion and depends heavily on the interpretation of the characters' powers and capabilities within their respective fictional universes.

Gandalf, from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, is a powerful and experienced wizard with a wide range of magical abilities, including combat magic, powerful spells, and considerable wisdom.

Rincewind, from Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, is a famously incompetent wizard who relies on luck and occasionally accidental magic rather than skill.  He is often portrayed as fleeing from danger rather than confronting it head-on.

While Rincewind's ""incompetence"" could be considered a unique kind of power, in a direct confrontation with a powerful wizard like Gandalf, it's highly unlikely he would win.  Gandalf's sheer magical power and experience far outweigh Rincewind's accidental successes.  Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Gandalf would likely win a hypothetical wizard battle against Rincewind.

Answer: {true}
"
462,Was a Tiny House ceiling out of Osama bin Laden's reach?,"The question asks if a ceiling in a tiny house would be out of Osama bin Laden's reach.  To answer this, we need to consider the typical height of a tiny house ceiling and Osama bin Laden's height.

Tiny houses generally have lower ceilings than standard houses, often around 7-8 feet tall.  Osama bin Laden was reported to be around 6 feet tall.  Even considering a slightly higher ceiling in a tiny house (perhaps 8 feet), it is unlikely a 6-foot tall man could not reach a ceiling at that height, and the height difference would be too small to prevent reaching it.

Answer: {false}

"
464,Is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Atari Landfill story an urban legend?,"The story of millions of unsold E.T. Atari cartridges being buried in a New Mexico landfill is widely circulated and often presented as fact.  However, while a large amount of unsold Atari games *were* disposed of, the scale of the event and the specific details (like the exact number of E.T. cartridges) have been exaggerated over time. The initial reports were often sensationalized, and the actual number of E.T. cartridges disposed of is likely far lower than the oft-cited millions. The story has become entwined with other urban legends and exaggerated details, adding to its mythical status. While a real disposal of Atari games happened, the extent and specific elements often recounted in the story are legendary embellishments.

Answer: {true}

The Order of the British Empire is a real award given to real people for distinguished service to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organisations, and public service outside the civil service.  While Hermione demonstrates exceptional bravery, intelligence, and service within the fictional world, she is not a real person and therefore ineligible for a real-world award.

"
468,Are all types of pottery safe to cook in?,"Explanation:
No, not all types of pottery are safe for cooking.  Some pottery glazes contain lead or cadmium, which are toxic heavy metals that can leach into food when heated.  Only pottery specifically labeled as ""oven-safe"" or ""food-safe"" should be used for cooking.  Even then, it's crucial to check the manufacturer's instructions and avoid extreme temperatures that could damage the glaze and release harmful substances.  Unglazed pottery can also be porous and absorb food and liquids, making it difficult to clean and potentially unsafe for cooking.


Answer: {false}
"
469,Was Pope Alexander VI's origin country least represented in papal history?,"Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) was born in Valencia, Spain.  To determine if Spain is the least represented country in papal history requires knowing the country of origin for all popes.  While Spain has had a significant number of popes, it's unlikely to be the *least* represented, given the long history of the papacy and the diverse geographic origins of popes throughout the centuries.  Extensive research would be needed to definitively answer this.  Without that data, we cannot confidently confirm or deny the statement.

Answer: {false}
"
470,Can depression be mistaken for laziness?,"Depression can manifest in various ways, including a lack of motivation, lethargy, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms can easily be misinterpreted as laziness or a lack of willpower.  However, depression is a serious mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and other significant changes in mood and behavior.  While outward appearances might suggest laziness, the underlying cause is a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  Therefore, attributing depressed behavior solely to laziness is inaccurate and potentially harmful.

Answer: {false}
"
471,Is Oculudentavis more dangerous than Allosaurus?,"Oculudentavis khaungraae is an extinct species of bird-like dinosaur.  Allosaurus was a large, predatory theropod dinosaur.  While Oculudentavis had teeth, it was small and likely preyed on insects or other small animals. Allosaurus, on the other hand, was a large apex predator that hunted much larger prey.  Therefore, Allosaurus would be considered significantly more dangerous than Oculudentavis.

Answer: {false}
"
472,Could Christopher Nolan borrow pants from Danny Devito?,"Christopher Nolan is a relatively tall man, reportedly around 6 feet tall. Danny DeVito is a notably short man, standing at approximately 4 feet 11 inches tall.

Answer: {false}
"
473,Are Big Ben's bells currently rung on their normal schedule at the Palace of Westminster?,"Big Ben, the Great Bell of the clock at the Palace of Westminster, has undergone significant restoration work.  This restoration, which included extensive repairs to the clock mechanism and the bell itself, caused the bells to be silenced for a period of time. While the restoration work is largely complete, the bells may not be rung on their exact normal schedule immediately following the completion of repairs.  There might be a period of adjustment or testing before the full schedule resumes.

"
477,Do silicone suits make judo difficult?,"Silicone suits, due to their slick and non-grip surface, would significantly hinder the ability to execute effective judo throws and grappling techniques.  The lack of friction between the suits would make it difficult to maintain a strong grip on the opponent's gi, which is crucial for executing throws and controlling the opponent.  Furthermore, the slickness could make it easier for the opponent to slip away from holds and submissions.  Therefore, silicone suits would likely make judo considerably more difficult.

Answer: {true}
"
478,Could boolean algebra be described as binary?,"Boolean algebra deals with only two values: true and false, or 1 and 0.  These are the fundamental components of binary systems.  Binary systems use only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all numbers and data.  Because Boolean algebra operates on these same two values, it is inherently a binary system.

479,Does Northern fur seal make good pet for six year old?,"Northern fur seals are wild animals that require specialized care and a vast habitat.  They are not domesticated animals and would not thrive in a typical home environment.  Their needs include a large space, a specific diet, and specialized veterinary care.  Furthermore, their wild instincts and powerful physical capabilities could pose a significant safety risk to a young child.  Therefore, a northern fur seal is absolutely unsuitable as a pet for a six-year-old.

"
480,Would Kurt Cobain have benefited from Project Semicolon?,"Project Semicolon is a non-profit organization that raises awareness about suicide prevention and mental health struggles.  Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of Nirvana, died by suicide.  Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that he could have potentially benefited from the resources and support that Project Semicolon offers.  While we can't definitively say he *would* have benefited, given his struggles with depression and addiction, the potential for positive impact is high.

Answer: {true}
"
481,Would an anxious person benefit from receiving courage from the Wizard of Oz?,"The Wizard of Oz is a fictional character who, while presented as powerful, ultimately lacks genuine magical ability.  His pronouncements of courage are thus empty gestures, unlikely to provide a meaningful or lasting benefit to an anxious person. While a placebo effect might offer temporary relief, the underlying anxiety would remain untreated.  True courage comes from within and requires addressing the root causes of anxiety, not receiving pronouncements from a charlatan.

Answer: {false}
"
482,Can a firewall protect against a short circuit?,"A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.  Its purpose is to prevent unauthorized access to a network or system.  A short circuit, on the other hand, is an electrical fault that occurs when an unintended path of low resistance allows current to flow.  Firewalls operate in the realm of software and network protocols; they have no ability to protect against a physical electrical fault like a short circuit.  A short circuit is a hardware-level issue that can cause damage to electrical equipment and potentially lead to fires.

488,Does Jason have anything in common with Dr. Disrespect?,"To determine if Jason and Dr. Disrespect have anything in common, we need more information about ""Jason.""  The question lacks context about who Jason is.  Without knowing anything about Jason's personality, profession, interests, or background, it's impossible to compare him to Dr. Disrespect (a popular streamer known for his flamboyant persona and gaming skills).  Any comparison would be purely speculative.

492,Did villain that killed Superman murder Robin?,"The question asks if the villain who killed Superman also murdered Robin.  To answer this, we need to know which villain killed Superman and whether that same villain also killed Robin.  There are multiple villains who have killed Superman in different storylines across various media (comics, movies, etc.). Similarly, multiple villains have killed Robin (there have been multiple Robins).  Without specifying which Superman and which Robin, and which villain killed Superman in this particular instance, it's impossible to definitively answer the question.

493,Would someone typically confuse a sweet potato with a pineapple?,"Sweet potatoes and pineapples are distinct fruits/vegetables with very different appearances, tastes, and textures.  A sweet potato is a root vegetable with a rough, earthy exterior and a starchy, slightly sweet interior. A pineapple is a tropical fruit with a spiky exterior and a juicy, tangy-sweet interior.  There's little to no visual or textural similarity that would lead to typical confusion between the two.

494,Is overfeeding Lactobacillus unwise for people without dental insurance?,"Explanation:
Lactobacillus is a genus of bacteria found in yogurt and other fermented foods.  While generally beneficial for gut health, overconsumption of foods high in Lactobacillus can contribute to tooth decay.  This is because Lactobacillus ferments sugars, producing acids that erode tooth enamel.  People without dental insurance may be less likely to afford regular dental checkups and treatments for cavities, making them more vulnerable to the negative dental consequences of excessive Lactobacillus consumption.

496,Would Cardi B. benefit from soy milk?,"Cardi B, like many people, could benefit from incorporating soy milk into her diet, depending on her individual needs and preferences.  Soy milk is a plant-based milk alternative that is a good source of protein and contains various vitamins and minerals.  However, whether it would specifically *benefit* her depends on factors like her dietary restrictions (allergies, intolerances), her health goals (weight management, bone health), and her personal preferences (taste, texture).  There is no inherent reason why soy milk would uniquely or necessarily benefit her more than other people.

"
497,Can an Arvanite Greek understand some of the Albanian Declaration of Independence?,"Arvanites are a Greek-speaking community in Greece with Albanian ancestry.  Their language, Arvanitika, shares many similarities with Tosk Albanian, one of the two main Albanian dialects.  While Arvanitika isn't mutually intelligible with standard Albanian, the significant linguistic overlap, particularly with Tosk Albanian, means an Arvanite Greek would likely understand some words and phrases in the Albanian Declaration of Independence, especially if it's in Tosk.  The degree of understanding would depend on the specific vocabulary used in the declaration and the Arvanite speaker's proficiency in Arvanitika.

Answer: {true}

498,Did breakdancing grow in popularity during WW2?,"Breakdancing, as a distinct dance style, emerged in the 1970s within the African American and Latino communities in the Bronx, New York City.  World War II ended in 1945, well before breakdancing's development. Therefore, it could not have grown in popularity during that time.

499,Is Romeo and Juliet an unusual title to teach high schoolers?,"Romeo and Juliet is a very well-known and frequently taught play in high school English classes around the world.  It's a classic work of literature, readily available, and provides opportunities for discussion on themes of love, fate, family conflict, and societal pressures—all relevant to the high school experience.  Its use in the classroom is therefore entirely conventional and not unusual.

500,Would Jon Brower Minnoch break a chair before Voyager 2 launch mass?,"Jon Brower Minnoch, at his heaviest, weighed 1,400 pounds.  Voyager 2's launch mass was approximately 1,835 kilograms, which is roughly 4,046 pounds.  Since 1400 pounds is less than 4046 pounds, he would not break a chair *because* of Voyager 2's launch mass.  The question is a bit nonsensical as the two things aren't directly related.  The question implies a comparison of weight, but the ""breaking a chair"" aspect is unrelated to Voyager 2.  The correct answer depends on whether we assume the question is asking if he weighed more than Voyager 2's launch mass (false) or if his weight alone could break a chair (likely true, but irrelevant to the comparison).  However, the question's structure suggests a comparison related to the launch mass.

503,Can a honey bee sting a human more than once?,"Honeybees have barbed stingers. When a honeybee stings a human, the barb catches in the skin, and the stinger, along with parts of the bee's abdomen, is torn from the bee's body.  This causes the bee to die.  Therefore, a honeybee can only sting once.

505,Do many fans of J.K Rowling know who Alan Rickman is?,"J.K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter series, and Alan Rickman played the significant role of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter film adaptations.  Given the immense popularity of the Harry Potter franchise and the prominent role of Snape, it's highly likely that a large percentage of J.K. Rowling's fans would also know Alan Rickman.  The association between the author and the actor is strong and readily apparent.

506,Would Hannah Nixon be proud of Richard Nixon following the Watergate scandal?,"The Watergate scandal severely damaged Richard Nixon's reputation and led to his resignation from the presidency.  This would likely cause significant distress and disappointment to his family, including his daughter Hannah Nixon. Given the severity of the scandal and its impact on his legacy, it's highly improbable Hannah Nixon would have been proud of her father's actions following Watergate.

509,Is Christopher Nolan indebted to Bob Kane?,"Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker known for his original screenplays and directorial style.  Bob Kane is the creator of Batman. While Nolan directed the hugely successful ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, which featured Batman, he did not create the character or the underlying mythology.  Therefore, he is not indebted to Bob Kane in the sense of owing him creative ownership. Nolan adapted existing material, but the creation of the character belongs to Kane.  He might be considered indebted in the sense that his films' success relies on the pre-existing popularity of Batman, but not in a legal or creative ownership sense.

Answer: {false}
"
511,Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?,"Japanese serfdom, while varying across time and region, generally lacked the legally defined and relatively fixed status of English serfdom during the medieval period.  English serfs were tied to the land and owed specific services to their lord, but their status was legally recognized and, while restrictive, provided a degree of inherent protection and predictability.  In contrast, the status of Japanese peasants, particularly those in later periods, was often more fluid and subject to exploitation depending on economic and political circumstances. While some Japanese peasants might enjoy relative security within a village structure, they weren't legally bound to the land in the same way as English serfs.  The overall social structure and the level of control exercised over the peasantry differed significantly between the two societies, making a direct comparison of ""higher status"" problematic.  One system was not inherently ""better"" or ""worse"" than the other, but rather functioned within different socio-political contexts. Thus, a clear determination of higher status is impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
517,Have any murderers outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record?,"Kane holds the record for most Royal Rumble eliminations in a single match with 11 eliminations in 2001.  To determine if any murderers have outlasted this record requires us to define ""outlasted"" in the context of eliminating others.  A murderer, by definition, has killed at least one person.  But this act of murder doesn't equate to eliminating someone in a wrestling match.  The question is mixing unrelated concepts.  Therefore, it's impossible to answer the question based on its premise.

Answer: {false}
"
518,Can you watch Rick and Morty in Mariana Trench?,"The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the ocean, with crushing water pressure and no sunlight.

"
520,Would a clouded leopard encounter an awake pangolin?,"Clouded leopards are nocturnal predators and ambush hunters. Pangolins are nocturnal and primarily ground-dwelling mammals.  Their habitats overlap in parts of Southeast Asia, so there is a possibility of encounter.  While a clouded leopard might hunt a pangolin, the pangolin's armored scales offer considerable protection. The likelihood of an encounter happening depends on many factors, including the specific locations within their overlapping ranges.

Answer: {true}
"
521,Is the name of a mythical creature also the name of a Small Solar System body?,"The question asks if a mythical creature's name is also the name of a small Solar System body.  To answer this, we need to consider mythical creatures and the names of small Solar System bodies.  Many small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids and moons, are named after figures from mythology.  Therefore, it's quite possible that a mythical creature's name is also the name of a small Solar System body.  We would need to research specific examples to confirm.

523,Is double duty an incorrect phrase for host of Dancing With The Stars?,"The term ""double duty"" typically implies someone performing two roles simultaneously or concurrently. While a host of Dancing With The Stars might have other commitments or jobs, the hosting role itself isn't inherently ""double duty."" The phrase suggests a more significant workload division than just one presenting role.  Therefore, calling the host's role ""double duty"" is generally inaccurate.

Answer: {true}
"
524,Do salmon mate in the Caspian Sea?,"Salmon are anadromous fish, meaning they are born in freshwater, migrate to saltwater to mature, and then return to freshwater to spawn.  The Caspian Sea is a saltwater sea. However,  salmon species don't typically spawn in the Caspian Sea itself. While some salmon species might enter brackish (partially salty) waters, the Caspian is largely saline and lacks the specific freshwater river systems necessary for salmon spawning.  Several species of sturgeon, which are also anadromous, do spawn in the rivers flowing into the Caspian Sea, but this is different from salmon.

529,Were muskets used in the Pacific War?,"The Pacific War, primarily fought between 1941 and 1945, was a period of significant technological advancement in warfare. While muskets were obsolete firearms by this time, having been largely replaced by breech-loading rifles and machine guns, it's highly improbable that muskets were used in a significant or organized way by any major combatant.  It's possible some isolated or irregular units might have possessed them, or they may have existed as historical artifacts, but they would not have played a role in the major battles or campaigns of the war. The weaponry employed during the Pacific War focused on modern, more effective firearms and other advanced military technology.

531,Is Britney Spears' breakdown attributed to bipolar disorder?,"Britney Spears' highly publicized mental health struggles in the early 2000s involved a period of erratic behavior and public breakdowns. While various factors contributed,  no official diagnosis of bipolar disorder was ever publicly released by her doctors or representatives.  The media speculated widely about her condition, but these were unsubstantiated.   Therefore, attributing her breakdown solely to bipolar disorder is inaccurate.

Answer: {false}
"
532,Is a Cassowary safer pet than a crane?,"Cassowaries are large, flightless birds known for their aggression and powerful kicks.  Their kicks can inflict serious injury, even death. Cranes, while large, are generally less aggressive towards humans. Although a crane's kick can still cause harm, it is significantly less dangerous than a cassowary's. Therefore, a crane would be considered a safer pet than a cassowary.

533,Was Mark Twain a struggling inventor?,"Mark Twain is widely known as a celebrated author, not an inventor.  While he held some patents (for a self-pasting scrapbook and an improved kind of shirt-stud), these were minor endeavors and did not define his career or financial situation. His primary source of income and fame came from his writing.  He experienced periods of both financial success and hardship as a writer, but his struggles weren't primarily related to invention.

"
535,Is the Berlin University of the Arts a Baroque period relic?,"The Berlin University of the Arts (Universität der Künste Berlin) was founded in 1773 as the Royal Academy of Arts.  However, the Baroque period is generally considered to have ended in the early 18th century. While the academy's origins predate the late Baroque by a few decades, the university itself isn't a building or artifact from that specific era.  Its current form and buildings are the result of much later development and reconstruction.  Therefore, it cannot be accurately described as a Baroque period relic.

"
538,Would Cuba Libre consumption help with insomnia?,"Cuba Libre is a cocktail consisting primarily of rum and cola.  Rum contains alcohol, which is a known depressant. While some people might find that a small amount of alcohol helps them relax and sleep, it's not a reliable or recommended treatment for insomnia.  In fact, larger amounts of alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns later in the night, leading to poorer quality sleep and even worsening insomnia. Therefore, consuming Cuba Libres is unlikely to help with insomnia and may even exacerbate it.

548,Can Darth Vader hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton without using The Force?,"Explanation:

This question requires comparing the physical attributes of Darth Vader and Bill Walton relevant to dunking a basketball.  While Bill Walton was a very tall and skilled basketball player, Darth Vader's suit significantly limits his mobility and flexibility.  The suit's bulk and mechanical limitations would likely make jumping and coordinating the arm and hand movement required for a dunk highly improbable, if not impossible, even if we disregard the fictional elements of the Star Wars universe.

549,Is popular science used to peer review papers?,"Popular science publications are not typically involved in the peer-review process for academic research papers.  Peer review is a process conducted by experts within a specific scientific field to evaluate the validity, originality, and significance of research before publication in academic journals.  Popular science magazines and websites, while valuable for disseminating scientific knowledge to a broader audience, are not generally equipped or structured to conduct this rigorous level of critical evaluation.  They may cover research findings that have already been peer-reviewed and published elsewhere, but they themselves are not a part of the formal peer-review system.

552,Could all of the 2008 Summer Olympics women find a hookup athlete partner?,"The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing had a total of 10,942 athletes participating.  There were more female athletes than male athletes, but the precise number of women is not directly stated in easily accessible information. To determine if every female athlete could find a male athlete partner, we'd need to know the precise number of women and men.  Assuming a roughly even split (which is unlikely, but necessary for a conservative estimate)  between men and women would mean there were roughly 5,000-6,000 female athletes. Even then, this is only a rough estimate; we don't have enough data to confirm whether there were enough male athletes to pair with every female athlete.  We don't know the sexual orientations of the athletes, which would affect pairings.  Without more precise data, we cannot definitively answer this.

557,Is unanimously elected president's birthday a break for mail carriers?,"The question asks if a unanimously elected president's birthday is a break for mail carriers.  There is no federal holiday for any president's birthday, regardless of how they were elected. While some states might observe a particular president's birthday as a state holiday, this would not necessarily impact mail delivery nationwide.  Mail carriers follow federal holiday schedules. Therefore, a unanimously elected president's birthday would not automatically be a break for mail carriers.

"
558,Can Paprika be made without a dehydrator?,"Paprika is made from dried red peppers.  While a dehydrator is a convenient way to dry peppers, it's not strictly necessary.  Peppers can be dried naturally by stringing them up in a well-ventilated, dry, and warm area, or by spreading them thinly on a screen or tray in direct sunlight (though direct sun can sometimes cause bleaching).  The drying process may take longer without a dehydrator, but it is still achievable.

561,Is Godzilla's image likely grounds for a lawsuit in 2050?,"Godzilla's copyright status is complex and depends on who holds the rights and how those rights have been managed over the years.  While Toho owns the copyright for the Godzilla character in Japan, the character has been used in various American films and media, which might have their own copyright protections.  These could complicate any lawsuit in 2050. Furthermore, fair use exceptions to copyright law exist and might allow use of Godzilla's image for commentary, parody, or other purposes.  Therefore, determining whether using Godzilla's image would be grounds for a lawsuit in 2050 without more specific details of the intended use is impossible.

563,Is cow methane safer for environment than cars?,"Cow methane contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, impacting global warming.  While cars also produce greenhouse gases, the overall impact of the transportation sector is a complex issue involving various pollutants beyond methane.  Directly comparing the environmental impact solely based on methane emissions from cows versus cars is an oversimplification.  The carbon footprint of cars includes manufacturing, fuel production, transportation of fuel, and the vehicle's lifespan, all of which contribute significantly.  The life cycle of cows and the management of their waste also contribute to greenhouse gasses. Therefore, neither is definitively ""safer"" for the environment.  A more comprehensive analysis considering the entire carbon footprint of both is needed.

566,Did the 40th president of the United States forward lolcats to his friends?,"The 40th president of the United States was Ronald Reagan.  Lolcats, internet memes featuring cats with humorous captions, became popular in the mid-2000s.  Ronald Reagan died in 2004.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that he forwarded lolcats to his friends.  While it's theoretically possible he might have interacted with early forms of internet humor, the timing of lolcats and his death makes it extremely unlikely.

568,Would Republic of Korea Navy dominate Eritrea navy?,"The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) is a significantly larger and more technologically advanced navy compared to the Eritrean Navy.  The ROKN possesses a wide range of modern warships, including destroyers, frigates, submarines, and amphibious assault ships, along with substantial air and coastal defense capabilities.  In contrast, the Eritrean Navy is considerably smaller and less sophisticated, with limited capabilities in terms of both size and technology.  The ROKN would therefore have a decisive advantage in any conflict.

569,Was The Great Gatsby inspired by the novel 1984?,"Explanation:
The Great Gatsby was published in 1925, while 1984 was published in 1949.  Therefore, it's impossible for 1984 to have inspired The Great Gatsby.  1984 could not have existed as a source of inspiration for a work written before it.

"
571,Is Michael an unpopular name in the United States?,"Answer: The Social Security Administration provides data on baby names.  While Michael was once extremely popular, its popularity has significantly declined in recent decades.  While it's still given to some babies, it's no longer among the top names, indicating it's less popular than it once was. Therefore, it could be considered relatively unpopular compared to its peak popularity.

Answer: {true}
"
572,WIll Noah's Ark hypothetically sail through flooded Lincoln Tunnel?,"Noah's Ark, as depicted in the biblical story, is described as a massive vessel built to withstand a global flood.  The Lincoln Tunnel, on the other hand, is a relatively small underwater passageway connecting New York and New Jersey.  Even if the tunnel were completely flooded, the sheer size of Noah's Ark, as traditionally described, would likely prevent it from fitting through the tunnel's relatively narrow confines.  Therefore, it is highly improbable that Noah's Ark could sail through a flooded Lincoln Tunnel.

Answer: {false}
"
573,Can someone with dermatitis be a hand model?,"Explanation: Dermatitis is a skin condition that causes inflammation and irritation.  The severity of dermatitis varies greatly.  While some cases are mild and might not significantly affect the appearance of the hands, others can be severe, causing redness, dryness, cracking, and even blistering.  A hand model relies on having clear, healthy-looking skin.  Severe dermatitis would likely prevent someone from being a successful hand model, though mild cases might not be a disqualifying factor. Therefore, it's not definitively impossible, but highly unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
574,"If Goofy were a pet, would he need heartworm prevention?","Goofy is a cartoon dog.  Dogs, including cartoon dogs, are susceptible to heartworm.  Therefore, even a fictional dog like Goofy would hypothetically require heartworm preventative medication.

Answer: {false}
"
577,"If he were poor, would Christopher Reeve have lived?","Christopher Reeve's death was caused by complications from a spinal cord injury he sustained in a riding accident.  His wealth and access to top-tier medical care likely prolonged his life and improved his quality of life after the accident, but it didn't prevent his eventual death from those complications.  Being poor might have resulted in less access to advanced treatments and rehabilitation, possibly shortening his life or reducing his quality of life, but poverty is not directly causally linked to his death.  His death was ultimately a consequence of the severity and complications of the spinal cord injury, regardless of his financial status.


Answer: {false}
"
578,Was 1941 Operation Barbarossa related to The Crusades?,"Operation Barbarossa, launched in June 1941, was Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.  The Crusades were a series of religious wars between the 11th and 13th centuries.  There is no direct historical connection between these two events.  While some might argue for indirect, tenuous links (e.g., the concept of a holy war), there's no meaningful relationship between the motivations, participants, or historical context of Operation Barbarossa and the Crusades.

Answer: {false}
"
579,Do carpenters understand geometry?,"Carpentry involves many tasks that require a practical understanding of geometry.

581,Would The Dark Knight be appropriate for a preschool class?,"The Dark Knight is a superhero film containing violence, intense action sequences, and mature themes unsuitable for preschoolers.  The movie's rating (PG-13) indicates it's inappropriate for young children.  The content would likely be frightening and confusing for preschool-aged children.

Answer: {false}
"
582,Can a computer be programmed entirely in Boolean algebra?,"Explanation:

Boolean algebra is a system of algebra in which the variables represent truth values (true or false, 1 or 0).  While Boolean algebra forms the foundation of digital logic and computer circuitry, it's not directly a programming language.  A computer program needs more than just true/false values; it needs instructions for operations, data storage, control flow (loops, conditionals), and input/output.  Boolean algebra can represent the *logic* within these operations (e.g., an `if` statement), but it cannot directly express the *instructions* themselves.  You would need a higher-level language to specify these instructions and manage the execution of the program.

Therefore, a computer cannot be programmed *entirely* in Boolean algebra.  Boolean algebra is a crucial underlying component, but insufficient on its own.


Answer: {false}

"
584,Are Donkeys part of Christmas celebrations?,"Donkeys are not typically central figures in mainstream Christmas celebrations, though they hold a significant role in the nativity story which many Christians celebrate during Christmas.  The nativity depicts Mary and Joseph traveling to Bethlehem on a donkey. While some nativity scenes and Christmas pageants include a donkey, it's not a symbol inherently part of the broader Christmas festivities in the way that Santa Claus, Christmas trees, or reindeer are.

Answer: {false}
"
585,Was the death of Heath Ledger caused by his work on The Dark Knight?,"Heath Ledger's death was attributed to an accidental overdose of prescription medications.  While the immense pressure and stress of working on a film like *The Dark Knight* may have contributed to his mental state and possibly his reliance on prescription drugs, it was not directly the cause of his death. The coroner's report specifically cites the drug overdose as the cause of death.  Therefore, the statement that his death was *caused* by his work on *The Dark Knight* is inaccurate.

Answer: {false}
"
586,Did Polar Bears roam around in Ancient Greece?,"Polar bears are native to the Arctic regions.  Ancient Greece is located in a much warmer, Mediterranean climate.  The habitats are incompatible, so polar bears could not have roamed in Ancient Greece.

Answer: {false}
"
588,Can paratroopers be used in a vacuum?,"Paratroopers require an atmosphere to deploy their parachutes.  Parachutes rely on air resistance to slow the descent of the paratrooper.  In a vacuum, there is no air, and therefore no air resistance.  Without air resistance, a parachute would be useless, and the paratrooper would experience a fatal impact.

"
589,Does highest US Court have enough seats for every Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 1952?,"Explanation:
The highest US court is the Supreme Court, which has 9 seats.  To determine if there are enough seats for every UK Prime Minister since 1952, we need to count the number of UK Prime Ministers since then.  If the number of Prime Ministers exceeds 9, then there are not enough seats.

Since 1952, the UK has had significantly more than 9 Prime Ministers.  Therefore, there are not enough seats on the US Supreme Court for each.

"
591,Do all of the African regions that participated in the Portugese Colonial War share an official language?,"The Portuguese Colonial War involved several African territories, primarily Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau.  While Portuguese was an official language in all three during the colonial period,  it's crucial to determine if this remains true *after* independence.  Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau all gained independence and chose different official languages following the end of the war.  While Portuguese remains an official language in all three, they also each have other official languages alongside Portuguese. Therefore, they do not share *only* one official language.

Answer: {false}
"
592,Can you find a railroad engineer on TNT?,"To answer this question, we need to consider if there is a TNT show featuring a railroad engineer as a main or significant recurring character.  There are many TNT shows, and it's unlikely a comprehensive list exists readily available to verify the presence or absence of a railroad engineer character.  Therefore, this question requires a deeper investigation into the cast and crew listings for many TNT shows.  Without access to a comprehensive database of all TNT shows and their characters, a definitive answer is impossible.

597,Do the James Bond and Doctor Who series have a similarity in format?,"Both James Bond and Doctor Who are long-running episodic series featuring a main character who travels to different locations and encounters various adversaries or challenges in each episode.  While the specifics of their adventures and the genres they blend differ (Bond leans more into espionage and action, Doctor Who into science fiction and adventure), the basic format of self-contained stories within a larger overarching narrative (though less so in Bond's case) is a key similarity.  Both have also seen numerous actors portray the main character over the years, maintaining the core concept while evolving the character's portrayal.

Answer: {true}
"
598,Did compact discs make computer gaming more popular?,"The rise in popularity of computer gaming was a complex phenomenon driven by many factors, not solely the introduction of compact discs (CDs). While CDs offered a higher storage capacity than previous formats like floppy disks and cartridges, leading to improved graphics and sound in games, other significant factors contributed to the growth of the gaming market.  These include advancements in computer processing power, the development of more sophisticated game engines, the increasing affordability of computers, and the broader societal shift towards digital entertainment.  It's impossible to isolate CDs as the *primary* driver of increased popularity.  While they played a role in enhancing the gaming experience, it was one element among many.

600,Are vinegar pickled cucumbers rich in lactobacillus?,"Vinegar-based pickles are made through a process of acidification using vinegar, not fermentation.  Lactobacillus is a bacteria crucial for the fermentation process that creates lactic acid, which is characteristic of fermented pickles (often called ""sour"" pickles).  Vinegar pickles, on the other hand, rely on the acetic acid in vinegar for their sour taste and preservation.  Therefore, vinegar pickles are not rich in lactobacillus.

Answer: {false}
"
601,Could George Washington's own speeches have been recorded live to a compact disc?,"Explanation:
Compact discs (CDs) were invented in the 1980s.  George Washington died in 1799.  Therefore, it would have been impossible to record his speeches live to a CD.

Answer: {true}
"
610,Did Disney get most of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book profits?,"Disney's 1967 animated film ""The Jungle Book"" is based on Rudyard Kipling's works. However, Disney did not acquire the rights to all of Kipling's works related to the stories in the film.  The film's adaptation uses elements from different stories and poems by Kipling, and the rights to these were likely acquired separately, meaning they wouldn't have had access to all the profits from those original works.  Disney's profits are solely from their adaptation and associated merchandise, not from all of Kipling's overall profits from his original works. Therefore, it is highly unlikely Disney received ""most"" of Kipling's profits from *The Jungle Book* stories.  Disney only received profits from their own film and related works.

Answer: {false}
"
611,Did Lamarck and Darwin agree about the origin of species diversity?,"Explanation:
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin both proposed theories of evolution, but their mechanisms differed significantly.  Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics suggested that organisms could pass on traits acquired during their lifetime to their offspring.  Darwin's theory of natural selection, on the other hand, proposed that variations within a population, arising through random mutation, would lead to differential survival and reproduction based on the environment, thereby driving the evolution of species. While both attempted to explain the diversity of species, their proposed mechanisms were fundamentally different.  They did not agree on the *origin* of the diversity itself, as Lamarck focused on acquired traits and Darwin focused on inheritable variations.


Answer: {false}
"
612,Are those incapable of reproduction incapable of parenthood?,"The question asks whether inability to reproduce automatically equates to inability to be a parent.  Parenthood is defined by the social and emotional roles and responsibilities associated with raising a child, not solely by biological procreation.  Many individuals become parents through adoption or fostering, neither of which require biological capacity to reproduce. Therefore, the premise that only those capable of reproduction can be parents is false.

Answer: {false}
"
613,Do guitarist's have fingers that can handle pain better than average?,"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that guitarists have a higher pain tolerance in their fingers than the average person.  While regular guitar playing might lead to some calluses and desensitization to pressure and minor abrasions, this is a localized adaptation, not a general increase in pain tolerance across the body.  Pain tolerance is a complex phenomenon influenced by genetics, psychological factors, and experiences, not simply by the development of calluses.

Answer: {false}
"
614,Would Methuselah hypothetically hold a record in the Common Era?,"Methuselah is a biblical figure who is said to have lived for 969 years.  The Common Era (CE) begins in the year 1.

615,"Would a 900,000 pound net worth person be an American billionaire if they exchange currency June 2020?","The question asks if a person with a net worth of £900,000 would be a billionaire (possessing over $1,000,000,000) in US dollars if they exchanged their currency in June 2020.  The provided information states the exchange rate is incorrect.  The conversion needs to be between pounds and dollars, not pounds and euros.  A more accurate exchange rate for June 2020 would be needed for a precise calculation.  However, even with a favorable exchange rate for the pound against the dollar in June 2020, £900,000 would not convert to over $1 billion.  Therefore, the statement is false.

Answer: {false}
"
616,Would fans of Jonathan Larson be unaware of HIV?,"Jonathan Larson, the composer of Rent, died of an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm.  However, Rent, his most famous work, explicitly deals with the AIDS epidemic and HIV/AIDS.  The musical centers around a group of young artists living with HIV/AIDS in New York City.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that fans of his work would be unaware of HIV.

617,Is it possible that June got its name from mythology?,"The month of June is named after the Roman goddess Juno.  Juno was the queen of the gods, the protector of marriage and childbirth, and the counterpart to the Greek goddess Hera.  Therefore, June's name does have origins in mythology.

Answer: {true}
"
618,Are looks the easiest way to tell rosemary from lavender?,"Rosemary and lavender are both aromatic herbs with similar growth habits, making visual identification sometimes difficult.  While lavender typically has a more delicate, silvery-gray foliage and smaller, more numerous flowers, rosemary can have a wider variety of leaf shapes and colours.  Leaf texture might provide a clue (lavender leaves are often fuzzy), but this isn't always reliable.  The most reliable way to distinguish them is through scent and flower shape/colour.  Therefore, relying solely on looks is not the easiest way to tell them apart.


Answer: {false}
"
619,Do you need different colored pens for sudoku?,"Sudoku requires the use of numbers, not colors.  The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.  Color doesn't play any role in the rules or solving process.

624,Is Dustin Hoffman one of the B'nei Yisrael?,"Dustin Hoffman is a well-known American actor of Jewish heritage.  While the term ""B'nei Yisrael"" (Children of Israel) refers to the Jewish people, it's important to note that religious affiliation is a personal matter, and not all individuals with Jewish heritage publicly identify with specific Jewish religious movements or traditions.  However, given his known Jewish ancestry, it is reasonable to say he is considered one of the B'nei Yisrael.

Answer: {true}
"
625,Is 1936 Summer Olympics venue too small for a Superbowl crowd?,"The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany.  The main stadium, the Olympiastadion, had a capacity of around 110,000 spectators.  Super Bowl crowds typically exceed 70,000, with many more attending related events. While the Olympiastadion could hold a significant portion of a Super Bowl crowd, it would not be large enough to accommodate the entire event, including ancillary activities.

628,Could someone with fine motor control issues benefit from an altered keyboard layout?,"Individuals with fine motor control issues often struggle with tasks requiring precise movements, such as typing on a standard keyboard.  An altered keyboard layout, such as one with larger keys, more spacing between keys, or a different key arrangement (e.g., a Dvorak keyboard), could significantly improve their typing speed and accuracy.  These adaptations reduce the range of motion and precision required for each keystroke, making typing less strenuous and more manageable. Therefore, an altered keyboard layout could be beneficial.

641,Do mail carriers need multiple uniforms?,"Mail carriers typically need multiple uniforms for several reasons:

* **Hygiene and cleanliness:**  A uniform worn all day, especially in varied weather conditions, will become soiled and require cleaning.  Having multiple uniforms allows for rotation and ensures the carrier always has a clean uniform to wear.

* **Weather conditions:**  Mail carriers work outdoors in all types of weather.  Having different uniforms for hot and cold weather can greatly improve comfort and safety.

* **Damage and wear:** Uniforms will inevitably wear out over time.  Having more than one prolongs the lifespan of each uniform and reduces the need for frequent replacements.

* **Unforeseen circumstances:**  Accidents or spills could damage a uniform, and a spare is crucial to maintain a professional appearance.

Therefore, based on these factors, it is likely that mail carriers require multiple uniforms.

A doctorate typically requires many years of education beyond a bachelor's degree.  While it's not impossible for exceptional individuals to complete a doctorate program at a young age, it's highly unusual. A 21-year-old claiming to hold a doctorate should raise significant skepticism.  The typical timeline for completing a doctoral program is significantly longer than what would be possible for someone that age.

643,Are deaf people left out of enjoying music?,"Deaf individuals experience music differently than hearing individuals.  While they may not perceive sound in the same way, they can still appreciate music through its rhythm, vibrations, and visual aspects like the movement of performers or the use of light shows.  Many deaf people enjoy music through these alternate sensory channels.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say they are completely left out.

"
644,Could Aretha Franklin vote for a president when her second child was born?,"Aretha Franklin's second child was born in 1961.  The 23rd Amendment to the United States Constitution, granting residents of the District of Columbia the right to vote in presidential elections, was ratified in 1961.  However, this only applies to the District of Columbia, not to all US citizens.  Aretha Franklin, as a US citizen, could have voted in presidential elections since she reached voting age, regardless of where she lived.  The question is whether she was of voting age (18) in 1961.  Assuming she was born in 1942, she would have been 19 years old in 1961.  Therefore, she would have been eligible to vote.

646,Do ants outperform apes on language ability?,"Explanation: Ants and apes belong to vastly different species with drastically different cognitive abilities.  Apes, particularly great apes like chimpanzees and gorillas, demonstrate significant capacity for communication and even rudimentary forms of language understanding, through sign language and other methods. Ants, while exhibiting complex social structures and communication within their colonies, lack the brain capacity and neural complexity necessary for the kind of language processing seen in apes.  Therefore, ants do not outperform apes on language ability.

Answer: {false}
"
647,Will the small intenstine break down a cotton ball?,"The small intestine is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption in the digestive system.  It does this through a combination of mechanical and chemical digestion.  Mechanical digestion involves the physical breakdown of food through muscular contractions (peristalsis). Chemical digestion involves enzymes that break down complex molecules into smaller, absorbable units.  Cotton, however, is primarily cellulose, a complex carbohydrate. Human beings lack the enzyme cellulase necessary to break down cellulose.  Therefore, a cotton ball would pass through the digestive system largely undigested.

Answer: {false}
"
648,Would a hippie hypothetically be bummed out by Augustus's Pax Romana?,"Explanation:
The Pax Romana, or Roman Peace, was a period of relative peace and prosperity in the Roman Empire.  While it brought stability and infrastructure improvements, it also involved significant suppression of dissent and the expansion of Roman power through conquest.  Hippies, associated with counter-culture movements emphasizing peace, love, and anti-establishment ideals, would likely find the authoritarian aspects of the Pax Romana at odds with their values.  The empire's military expansion and subjugation of other peoples would also conflict with a hippie's pacifist tendencies.

Answer: {true}
"
649,Can musicians become knights?,"Explanation:
The awarding of knighthoods is a tradition primarily associated with the British honours system, although other countries have similar systems.  Knighthoods are typically given for outstanding service to the nation,  significant contributions to the arts, or other exceptional achievements.  While musicians are not specifically excluded, the criteria for receiving a knighthood are broad and based on merit.  Therefore, it is entirely possible for a musician to be deemed worthy of a knighthood based on their achievements and contributions. Many musicians have received knighthoods, showcasing the possibility.

"
652,"If you have black hair and want red hair, do you need bleach?","To achieve red hair from black hair, you would likely need to lighten the hair significantly first.  Black hair contains a high concentration of melanin, which is a dark pigment.  Red hair dye itself is not strong enough to overcome this dark pigment; it needs a lighter base to work effectively. Bleach is a chemical hair lightening product used to remove melanin from the hair shaft.  Therefore, bleaching the hair before applying red dye is usually necessary to achieve a vibrant red color and prevent the red dye from appearing dull or muddy.

Answer: {true}
"
653,Do you often hear Marco Polo's name shouted near water?,"Marco Polo was a famous explorer, and his travels are often associated with water, given his extensive journeys across oceans and seas.

656,Did either side score a touchdown during the Football War?,"The Football War, also known as the Soccer War, was a brief conflict between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969.  The war's name is derived from the intense football (soccer) rivalry between the two countries, which escalated tensions that already existed due to factors such as disputes over land ownership and immigration. While the football matches acted as a catalyst for the war, the conflict itself involved military actions and fighting, not a literal football game with touchdowns.  Touchdowns are a scoring element in American football, not soccer.

658,Were paparazzi directly responsible for the death of Amy Winehouse?,"Amy Winehouse's death was attributed to alcohol poisoning, and while paparazzi contributed to the stressful environment surrounding her life, their actions were not the direct cause of her death.  While intense media attention can certainly exacerbate existing mental health issues and contribute to unhealthy lifestyles, it's not accurate to say paparazzi were directly responsible for her death.  Her death was a result of her own alcohol consumption.

660,Has Drew Carey outshined Doug Davidson's tenure?,"Drew Carey took over hosting duties for *The Price Is Right* from Bob Barker in 2007.  Doug Davidson played Paul Williams on *The Young and the Restless* for decades, from 1978 to 2018.  While both enjoyed long and successful careers in their respective fields, comparing their ""outshining"" is subjective and depends on the criteria used.  There's no objective metric to determine who had a more successful or impactful career.  In terms of sheer longevity and cultural impact on daytime television, Doug Davidson's run on *The Young and the Restless* is arguably unmatched.  However, Drew Carey's hosting of a major game show is a significant achievement as well. The question is too vague to definitively answer.

Answer: {false}
"
661,Do embalmed bodies feel different at funerals?,"Embalmed bodies are treated with chemicals that preserve them and alter their physical properties.  The process of embalming removes fluids and replaces them with preservatives, resulting in a firmer, less flexible body. The skin may also feel cooler and drier than a non-embalmed body.  These changes would certainly make an embalmed body feel different to the touch than a recently deceased, unembalmed body.

"
669,Do quadragenarian's have little memory capacity?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation: There's no scientific basis to suggest that people in their forties (quadragenarians) have inherently less memory capacity than other age groups.  Memory capacity can vary greatly from person to person due to factors like genetics, lifestyle, and overall health, not solely based on age.  While some age-related cognitive changes may begin later in life, a 40-year-old is generally not considered to be experiencing significant memory decline.
"
670,Did any country in Portuguese Colonial War share Switzerlands role in WWII?,"The Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974) involved Portugal fighting independence movements in its African colonies. Switzerland, during World War II, maintained neutrality.  There's no parallel between a nation fighting a colonial war and a nation maintaining strict neutrality in a world war.  No country involved in the Portuguese Colonial War acted in a way that mirrored Switzerland's neutrality during WWII.  The situations are fundamentally different.

677,Would the historic Hattori Hanzō admire Naruto?,"Hattori Hanzō was a legendary Japanese warrior known for his unmatched skill and loyalty.  Naruto Uzumaki, the protagonist of the anime Naruto, is also a skilled warrior who values loyalty and his friends. While their methods and eras differ greatly, both characters share a strong sense of duty and determination.  Hanzō's respect would likely depend on Naruto's actions and character, but given Naruto's bravery, strength, and commitment to protecting his friends and village, it's plausible that Hanzō might find something to admire. He might even see a reflection of his own dedication to duty and skill in the young ninja.  However, Hanzō might also be critical of Naruto's less disciplined moments or the methods he employs, given the historical Hanzō's likely strict code of conduct.  Ultimately, admiration isn't guaranteed, but it's certainly possible.

680,Can you avoid internet trolls on reddit?,"Explanation:
Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit requires a multi-pronged approach.  There's no foolproof method, as trolls are adaptable and often driven by the very engagement they seek to provoke. However, strategies to minimize interaction and negative impact include:

* **Don't feed the trolls:** This is the most crucial advice.  Responding, even negatively, often fuels their behavior.  Ignoring them is the best way to starve the troll of the attention they crave.

* **Report and block:** Reddit provides reporting mechanisms for harassment and rule violations. Use these tools liberally. Blocking a user prevents them from interacting with your posts or comments.

* **Subreddit selection:**  Certain subreddits are known for attracting more trolls than others.  Choose subreddits with active moderation and clear community guidelines.

* **Contextual awareness:** Be mindful of the topic and the overall tone of the conversation. Some topics inherently attract more inflammatory comments and trolling.

* **Avoid emotional responses:**  Trolls often try to elicit strong emotional reactions.  Maintaining a calm and neutral demeanor can make you a less attractive target.

* **Strong moderation:** If you're a moderator of a subreddit, enforcing rules consistently and swiftly is vital in deterring trolling behavior.


Answer: {It is difficult to completely avoid internet trolls on Reddit, but a combination of ignoring, reporting, blocking, and choosing appropriate subreddits can significantly reduce negative interactions.}

Answer: {true}
"
688,Is the Very Large Telescope the most productive telescope in the world?,"The question asks if the Very Large Telescope (VLT) is the most productive telescope in the world.  Productivity in astronomy can be measured in several ways, including the number of scientific publications resulting from observations, the impact of those publications on the field, the range of scientific discoveries made, and the total observing time allocated.  While the VLT is a highly productive and influential telescope, making significant contributions to astronomy, claiming it's definitively *the most* productive is difficult to definitively prove without a comprehensive, quantitative comparison across all telescopes worldwide, considering all the metrics mentioned above.  Such a comparison would be extremely complex and is not readily available in a single, universally accepted source.  Therefore, while the VLT is exceptionally productive, a definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to this question is not possible based on readily available information.

Answer: {false}

689,Would Statue of Liberty be visible if submerged in Bohai Sea?,"The Statue of Liberty is approximately 305 feet tall.  The Bohai Sea is a relatively shallow sea, but its depth varies considerably.  Even in shallower areas, it's highly unlikely that the entire statue would be completely submerged.  A significant portion, if not most, of the statue would likely remain visible above the waterline, even in relatively deep parts of the Bohai Sea.

Answer: {false}
"
690,Do flying fish have good eyesight?,"Flying fish are known for their ability to glide through the air, using their large, wing-like pectoral fins.  While this adaptation is primarily for evading predators, it requires good eyesight to navigate effectively both in the air and water.  They need to locate prey, spot predators, and judge distances accurately for successful gliding.  Studies have not definitively shown poor eyesight in flying fish, and the demands of their lifestyle suggest good visual acuity is necessary for survival.

Answer: {true}
"
691,Would JPEG be a good format for saving an image of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man?,"JPEG is a lossy compression format, meaning it discards some image data to reduce file size.  While this is great for photographs where some loss of detail is acceptable, it's less ideal for fine art like Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man where preserving every detail is crucial. The intricate lines and shading would likely suffer from artifacts and blurring introduced by JPEG compression.  A lossless format like PNG or TIFF would be far better suited to preserving the artwork's quality.

Answer: {false}
"
692,Did Pedubastis I know Japanese people?,"Pedubastis I was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt who ruled during the 21st Dynasty.  Ancient Egypt and Japan had no contact during his lifetime.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that he would have known any Japanese people.

"
694,Can a ten-pin bowling pin be a deadly weapon?,"Explanation: A ten-pin bowling pin is a relatively small, lightweight object made of wood or plastic.  While it could potentially be used as a weapon to inflict injury, it's not inherently designed for that purpose.  The force required to cause serious injury using a bowling pin would likely be significant.  Therefore, it's unlikely to be considered a deadly weapon in most circumstances.  The potential for it to be used as a weapon depends heavily on the context and the manner in which it is used.

Answer: {false}
"
695,Did origin dynasty of Go precede Jia Sidao?,"The question asks whether the Go dynasty preceded Jia Sidao.  To answer this, we need to know the time periods of both.

The Go Dynasty (also known as the Goryeo Dynasty) existed in Korea from 918 to 1392 CE.

Jia Sidao was a powerful official in the Song Dynasty of China, who lived from 1213 to 1275 CE.

Since the Go Dynasty existed from 918 to 1392 CE, and Jia Sidao lived from 1213 to 1275 CE, a portion of the Go Dynasty's existence overlapped with Jia Sidao's lifetime. Therefore, the Go dynasty did precede Jia Sidao's rise to power and significantly outlasted him.

697,Can a false pope become a saint?,"The process of sainthood in the Catholic Church involves a rigorous investigation into the life and virtues of the candidate.  A key element is that the person must be considered to have lived a holy life in accordance with Catholic teachings.  A ""false pope,"" by definition, would be someone who claimed the papacy illegitimately—either through usurpation or a flawed election process.  Such a person would likely be judged to have acted against the very principles and authority of the Church.  Therefore, their actions would contradict the requirements for sainthood.  Even if they possessed personal piety, the illegitimacy of their position and potential acts committed during their time in office would heavily weigh against canonization.  It's highly unlikely, even impossible, for a false pope to become a saint.

Answer: {false}

701,Do anatomical and symbolic hearts look remarkably different?,"Anatomical hearts are the physical organs responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.  They are complex muscular structures with specific chambers, valves, and blood vessels.  Symbolic hearts, on the other hand, are representations of the heart often used in art, literature, and other forms of expression. They may take many forms—a simple red shape, a stylized drawing, or an intricate design. The differences are vast;  an anatomical heart is a three-dimensional organ with intricate internal structures, while a symbolic heart is a two-dimensional representation that focuses on conveying emotions or concepts.

"
708,Can you transport a primate in a backpack?,"The answer depends on several factors, including the size of the primate, the size and type of backpack, and the applicable laws and regulations.  A small primate, such as a marmoset, might conceivably fit into a large backpack, though this is not recommended. However, larger primates would obviously not fit.  More importantly, transporting a primate in a backpack is likely illegal in most jurisdictions due to animal welfare concerns and potential public safety hazards.  Primates require specialized care and housing, and transporting them in a backpack would expose them to significant stress and potential injury.  Also, many countries and states have strict regulations about the ownership and transportation of primates.

Answer: {false}
"
709,Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?,"To answer this question, we need to compare the estimated album sales of AC/DC and Lil Wayne, and then compare the cost of a B-52 bomber to determine which artist's sales could buy more bombers.  This requires estimations and assumptions, as precise sales figures and bomber costs are not readily available and can fluctuate.  We need to make reasonable estimations.

Let's make some assumptions:

* **AC/DC Album Sales:** AC/DC has sold hundreds of millions of albums globally over their career.  Let's assume a conservative estimate of 200 million albums sold.  This is likely an underestimate.
* **Lil Wayne Album Sales:** Lil Wayne has also sold tens of millions of albums. Let's assume a figure of 50 million albums sold. This is also likely an underestimate, but significantly lower than AC/DC's.
* **Average Album Price:**  Let's assume an average album price of $10 across both artists' careers, although this will vary greatly depending on format (vinyl, CD, digital).
* **B-52 Bomber Cost:**  The cost of a B-52 bomber varies depending on the time of purchase, upgrades, and other factors. A very rough estimate could range between $80-$100 million per plane. We will use $80 million for simplicity.

**Calculations:**

* **AC/DC Revenue:** 200,000,000 albums * $10/album = $2,000,000,000
* **Lil Wayne Revenue:** 50,000,000 albums * $10/album = $500,000,000
* **AC/DC Bombers:** $2,000,000,000 / $80,000,000/bomber = 25 bombers
* **Lil Wayne Bombers:** $500,000,000 / $80,000,000/bomber = 6.25 bombers

Based on these conservative estimations, AC/DC's album sales would buy significantly more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's.  The actual numbers could be higher or lower depending on the accuracy of the sales and cost figures used.

710,Is Ludacris in same music genre as 2000's Binaural?,"Ludacris is primarily known for his work in hip hop and Southern hip hop.  Binaural, as a term, doesn't refer to a specific music genre but rather a recording technique used to create a three-dimensional, spatial sound effect.  While some artists in various genres might have used binaural recording techniques in the 2000s,  it's not a genre itself.  Therefore, Ludacris and ""2000s Binaural"" are not comparable in terms of musical genre.

"
712,"Could pickled cucumbers from 1,000 years ago be good still?","Answer: Pickled cucumbers rely on a process of fermentation and preservation using salt and vinegar to inhibit the growth of microorganisms that cause spoilage.  While this method can significantly extend the shelf life of food, 1,000 years is far beyond the reasonable expectation for even the most perfectly preserved pickles.  The containers would likely have deteriorated, and even if the pickles remained intact, the quality, safety, and edibility would be highly questionable due to potential contamination and degradation of the product over such a vast timescale.

Answer: {false}
"
713,Do Flat Earthers doubt the existence of Earth's magnetic field?,"Flat-Earth theory rejects the spherical model of Earth, often citing inconsistencies with their perceived observations.  The existence of a global magnetic field is strong scientific evidence supporting a spherical Earth.  A magnetic field, as we understand it, requires a planet of substantial size and specific internal structure to generate its dipole field.  The explanation of the Earth's magnetic field is fundamentally tied to its spherical shape and internal dynamics (the geodynamo).  Flat-Earth proponents generally do not accept these scientific explanations, so their worldview inherently clashes with the accepted understanding of the magnetic field.  Therefore, it's highly likely that Flat-Earthers would doubt or attempt to offer alternative, unscientific explanations for the observed magnetic field.

Answer: {true}
"

717,Does 2015 have more unlucky Friday's than usual?,"To determine if 2015 had more unlucky Fridays than usual, we need to define ""usual"" and then count the number of Friday the 13ths in 2015.  A typical year has either one or two Friday the 13ths.  Let's check 2015:

January 2015: Friday the 13th
October 2015: Friday the 13th

2015 had two Friday the 13ths. This is not unusual, as some years have two.

727,Would someone with a nosebleed benefit from Coca?,"Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink.  A nosebleed, or epistaxis, is caused by broken blood vessels in the nose.  While the cold temperature of Coca-Cola might temporarily constrict blood vessels, offering a slight reduction in bleeding, this effect is temporary and unreliable.  Furthermore, the carbonation could potentially irritate the nasal passages and worsen the bleeding.  Therefore, applying Coca-Cola to a nosebleed is not a recommended or effective treatment;  medical advice should be sought for managing nosebleeds.

Answer: {false}
"
728,Does Justin Bieber vote in October?,"Answer: To determine if Justin Bieber votes in October, we need to consider two factors: his eligibility to vote and the timing of elections.  Justin Bieber is a Canadian citizen.  Canadian federal elections are not held in October.  While some provincial elections might be held in October, it is not guaranteed that he would be voting in any election that month.  Therefore, it's unlikely he would vote in October.

"
736,Did Native American tribes teach Spaniards how to cultivate maize?,"Explanation:
Historical records indicate that maize cultivation was already well-established among various Native American tribes in the Americas long before the arrival of Spanish colonists.  While the exact details of knowledge exchange are complex and varied, it's highly likely that Spanish colonists learned about maize cultivation and agricultural techniques from Native Americans.  They certainly adopted and adapted the knowledge for their own use.  Therefore, it's plausible to conclude that Native American tribes did indeed teach, or at least demonstrate, maize cultivation to the Spanish.

"
738,Can your psychologist say hello to you while you are out at the supermarket?,"Explanation: A psychologist's professional relationship with a patient is typically confined to the therapeutic setting. While a psychologist might encounter a patient outside of the office, it is highly unlikely they would initiate a social interaction such as saying hello, especially in a public space like a supermarket.  Professional boundaries must be maintained to protect the patient and the integrity of the therapeutic relationship.  Such an interaction could be misinterpreted by the patient or create discomfort.

"
739,Is Hamlet more common on IMDB than Comedy of Errors?,"To determine whether ""Hamlet"" is more common on IMDB than ""Comedy of Errors,"" we need to consider how IMDB organizes and presents information.  IMDB lists movies and TV shows, and both *Hamlet* and *A Comedy of Errors* have numerous adaptations.  A simple search for ""Hamlet"" will yield many more results than a search for ""Comedy of Errors"" due to the sheer number of film and television adaptations of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* compared to the relatively fewer adaptations of *A Comedy of Errors*.  Therefore, it's highly probable that ""Hamlet"" appears more frequently in IMDB's database.

741,Can an elite runner circle the Pyrenees in one day?,"The Pyrenees mountain range is approximately 430 km (270 miles) long.  Elite runners can maintain a pace of roughly 10 km/hour (6.2 mph) for extended distances, though this varies greatly depending on terrain.  Even assuming an incredibly fast and sustained pace of 10 km/hour for a full day (24 hours), an elite runner could cover 240 km (150 miles).  This is significantly less than the length of the Pyrenees mountain range. Therefore, circling the entire Pyrenees mountain range in a single day is extremely unlikely, even for an elite runner.

Answer: {false}

Claims of such discoveries are generally unsubstantiated.
"
745,Is Pan a symbol of virtue and virginity in women?,"Pan, the Greek god, is associated with nature, wildness, and sexuality, not virtue and virginity.  While some depictions might show him with nymphs, the overall portrayal isn't one of chastity or innocence.  His associations are more with fertility and the untamed aspects of the natural world. Therefore, Pan is not a symbol of virtue and virginity in women.

Answer: {false}
"
746,Will Justin Bieber take over Mike Pence's position in 2020?,"Answer: Justin Bieber is a Canadian singer.  Mike Pence was the Vice President of the United States in 2020.

Diamonds, while extremely durable, can be destroyed under certain conditions (extreme heat, pressure, etc.). Therefore, the title is not a literally true statement.

Answer: {false}
"
748,Did France win the French Revolution?,"The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in late 18th-century France.  The revolution was not won by any single entity, but rather resulted in a complex series of changes in French government and society.  While France ultimately abolished the monarchy and established a republic,  the revolution was marked by internal conflict, violence, and shifting power dynamics.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say France ""won"" the revolution.  The revolution fundamentally altered the French state, but it was a process with many actors and outcomes, not a victory for France as a single entity.

Answer: {false}
"
749,Are classic nintendo games for emulator legal?,"The legality of emulating classic Nintendo games is complex and depends on several factors, primarily copyright law.  While emulators themselves are generally legal (as they are simply programs that mimic the hardware of a game console), the act of using ROMs (read-only memory) containing the game's data is where the legality becomes murky.  Distributing ROMs of copyrighted games is unequivocally illegal, as it infringes on Nintendo's copyright.  However, the legality of *owning* a ROM is less clear-cut and varies by jurisdiction. Some argue that possessing a ROM of a game you already own is akin to making a backup copy, which is generally allowed under fair use principles in some circumstances.  However, this is a complex legal area, and Nintendo actively pursues legal action against those who distribute or make ROMs readily available. Therefore, while the emulator itself is legal, using it with illegally obtained ROMs is illegal.

Answer: {false}
"
750,Could the children of Greek hero Jason hypothetically fill a polo team?,"Answer: Jason, in Greek mythology, had several children depending on the version of the myth.

"
754,Can you give at least one word from the Torah to all residents of Bunkie Louisiana?,"The Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses or the Pentateuch, is written in Hebrew.  To give ""at least one word from the Torah"" to all residents of Bunkie, Louisiana, requires selecting a single Hebrew word that can be understood or at least represented in a way that transcends language barriers.  A single, universally understood concept is needed.  While a direct translation is not possible for everyone, we can choose a word that embodies a fundamental human experience present across all cultures.

The word ""אֱלֹהִים"" (Elohim), often translated as ""God,"" fits this criterion. While not everyone in Bunkie will be Jewish or even believe in God in the same way,  the concept of a higher power or divine force is recognized in many faiths and philosophies.  Using a single word from the Torah minimizes the linguistic barrier, providing a common ground for all.

Answer: {אֱלֹהִים}
"
755,Can eating your weight in celery prevent diabetes?,"Explanation:
Eating a large quantity of celery, even an amount equal to one's body weight, is unlikely to prevent diabetes.  While celery has some nutritional benefits and is relatively low in calories, it does not contain any magical properties that would prevent or cure diabetes.  Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder involving insulin production and/or function. A healthy diet and lifestyle, including appropriate portions of vegetables like celery, are components of managing diabetes but are not a standalone cure or preventative.  The sheer volume of celery would likely cause digestive upset before having any meaningful impact on blood sugar regulation.

Answer: {false}
"
756,Is 500GB USB device enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day?,"Here's an explanation to determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day:

First, we need to estimate the size of a single hour of Netflix streaming.  This varies greatly depending on the video quality (resolution) selected.  A low-quality stream might be around 0.5GB per hour, while a high-quality 4K stream could easily exceed 7GB per hour. Let's assume a moderate quality stream averaging 2GB per hour for this calculation.

Ten hours of streaming would then require 10 hours * 2GB/hour = 20GB of storage per day.

Over a week, that would be 20GB/day * 7 days/week = 140GB.

Over a month (assuming 30 days), that would be 20GB/day * 30 days/month = 600GB.


Therefore, a 500GB USB drive would likely be insufficient to store 10 hours of Netflix shows daily for even a month. It might hold a week's worth, but that is highly dependent on the video quality setting used when streaming.

Answer: {false}
"
757,Can Arnold Schwarzenegger deadlift an adult Black rhinoceros?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:

While Arnold Schwarzenegger is incredibly strong, a black rhinoceros is a massive and powerful animal.  Adult black rhinos can weigh anywhere from 2,200 to 3,300 pounds, and are incredibly strong.  Even a highly trained individual like Schwarzenegger is unlikely to be able to lift that much weight.  The feat is physically improbable.
"
758,Are there multiple Star Wars TV shows produced by Disney?,"Disney, since acquiring Lucasfilm, has produced numerous Star Wars television series.  Examples include The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Andor, and several animated series.  Therefore, the statement is true.

"
761,Could the Port of Baltimore handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year?,"To determine if the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year, we need to compare the port's capacity with the global ginger production volume.

First, we need to find the annual global ginger production.  While precise figures fluctuate yearly, a reasonable estimate is several million metric tons.

Second, we need to find the Port of Baltimore's cargo handling capacity.  This involves looking at its annual tonnage handled across all goods.  The Port of Baltimore is a significant port, but it's unlikely its capacity would even remotely approach handling several million metric tons of a single product (ginger) annually.  Even if a substantial portion of its capacity were dedicated to ginger, it's highly improbable it could handle all global production.

Therefore, it's extremely unlikely the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's ginger production in a year.

Answer: {false}
"
762,Is it possible for biologist Rachel Carson to have flown to the moon?,"Explanation:

"
765,Could an ocelot subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day?,"An ocelot is a relatively large carnivorous mammal, requiring a substantial amount of protein in its diet.  Bee hummingbirds are extremely small.  A single bee hummingbird would provide an insignificant amount of calories and nutrients for an ocelot, nowhere near enough to sustain its energy needs for a day.  Therefore, an ocelot could not subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day.

Answer: {false}
"

767,Does horseradish have a fetlock?,"Horseradish is a plant, specifically a root vegetable.  Fetlocks are joints found on the legs of four-legged animals, specifically the area above the hoof or pastern.  Since horseradish is a plant and lacks legs and hooves, it cannot have a fetlock.

Answer: {false}
"
768,Is there any absolute way to prevent abortion?,"There is no absolute way to prevent abortion.  While various measures such as comprehensive sex education, readily available and affordable contraception, and restrictive abortion laws can reduce the number of abortions, none of these methods are foolproof.  People will always find ways to terminate pregnancies, regardless of legal restrictions or societal pressures.  Furthermore,  definitions of abortion itself vary across cultures and throughout history.  Even with the strictest laws in place, individuals may resort to unsafe, potentially life-threatening methods of self-induced abortion.  Therefore, a complete prevention of abortion is practically impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
769,Are you likely to hear Rammstein playing in smooth jazz clubs?,"Rammstein is a German industrial metal band known for its aggressive, hard-hitting sound and often provocative lyrics and stage shows.  Smooth jazz, on the other hand, is characterized by its mellow, relaxed tempos and sophisticated instrumental arrangements.  The two genres are vastly different in style and appeal.  It's highly improbable that a smooth jazz club, aiming for a relaxed and sophisticated atmosphere, would play Rammstein.

"
773,Would P. G. Wodehouse be taught in second grade?,"P.G. Wodehouse's works are known for their sophisticated humor, complex sentence structures, and subtle wordplay.  These elements are generally considered too advanced for second-grade reading comprehension levels.  Second-grade curricula typically focus on simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and more straightforward narratives.  While some adapted versions of children's literature might exist, the original works of P.G. Wodehouse are highly unlikely to be taught in a second-grade classroom.

Answer: {false}
"
774,Did Richard Wagner support the Nazis?,"Richard Wagner died in 1883, well before the Nazi party came to power in 1933.  However, his anti-Semitic writings and musical works were later adopted and exploited by the Nazis to promote their ideology.  While he didn't personally support the Nazis, his ideas and legacy were posthumously used to support their cause.  Therefore, a direct ""yes"" or ""no"" is misleading.  The question requires nuance.

"
775,Does Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint?,"The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a sui iuris Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope.  While it shares some saints with the Eastern Orthodox Churches, its official canon of saints is distinct. Alexander Nevsky is venerated as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church and some other Orthodox churches. However, there's no evidence suggesting the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church officially recognizes Alexander Nevsky as a saint.  Given the historical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and the distinct liturgical and canonical traditions of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, it's highly unlikely they would include him in their official list.

Answer: {false}

776,Would it be difficult to host Stanley Cup Finals at Rock in Rio?,"Rock in Rio is a massive outdoor music festival held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The Stanley Cup Finals require a large, enclosed arena with specific ice rink dimensions and seating arrangements for a hockey game.  These are fundamentally different venues with incompatible setups.  Adapting Rock in Rio's infrastructure to accommodate a hockey game would be incredibly complex, expensive, and likely impossible within a reasonable timeframe.  Therefore, hosting the Stanley Cup Finals at Rock in Rio would be extremely difficult, if not entirely infeasible.

781,Is Mixed martial arts totally original from Roman Colosseum games?,"Mixed martial arts (MMA) shares some similarities with Roman Colosseum games in that both involve combat between individuals, but they are not directly derived from each other.  Roman Colosseum contests were often to the death and featured a variety of weapons and fighting styles that were not standardized or regulated.  MMA, in its modern form, is a regulated sport with specific weight classes, rules, and judging criteria. While some hand-to-hand fighting techniques used in MMA may have ancient roots, the modern sport's structure and organization are distinctly different from the chaotic and often brutal spectacles of the Roman Colosseum.  Therefore, MMA is not totally original *from* Roman Colosseum games; it draws upon a history of various fighting styles but is a unique modern sport with its own rules and structure.

"
786,Would Doctor Strange like the Pittsburgh Steelers logo?,"Doctor Strange's aesthetic is heavily influenced by mystical and ancient imagery, often featuring intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and symbolic designs.  The Pittsburgh Steelers logo, while iconic, is relatively simple and features a stark black and gold color scheme with a somewhat minimalist design.  It's unlikely that Doctor Strange, with his preference for more complex and visually striking designs, would find the Steelers logo particularly appealing.  Therefore, it's improbable that he would ""like"" it in the sense of finding it aesthetically pleasing.

787,Is there a Yeti associated with Disney theme parks?,"Disney does not have a Yeti associated with its theme parks in the same way that it has other iconic characters like Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.  While there is a Yeti animatronic figure in the now-closed ""Matterhorn Bobsleds"" ride at Disneyland, this is a singular, specific instance within a single ride, and not a widely recognized or marketed Disney character like the others.  The Yeti itself isn't a central figure in any Disney storytelling or merchandising.

"
791,Can Africanized bees be considered multicultural?,"Africanized honeybees are a hybrid species resulting from the crossbreeding of African honeybees with European honeybees.  Their genetic makeup reflects this diverse origin, incorporating traits from multiple subspecies.  While ""multicultural"" typically refers to human societies, the term, when applied metaphorically, can describe a mixture of diverse elements.  Therefore, considering their hybrid origins and the combination of genetic traits from different sources, Africanized bees can be considered multicultural in a metaphorical sense.

"
792,Could Eddie Hall hypothetically deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger?,"Explanation:
To answer this question, we need to find the weight of the world's largest cheeseburger and compare it to Eddie Hall's deadlift record.

According to the Guinness World Records, the world's largest cheeseburger weighed 1,360 pounds.  Eddie Hall's official world record deadlift is 1102 pounds.  Since 1360 pounds exceeds 1102 pounds, it is unlikely Eddie Hall could deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger.

793,Would it be impossible to keep an ocean sunfish and a goldfish in the same tank?,"Ocean sunfish are massive, requiring enormous tanks. Goldfish, while varying in size, are comparatively small.  The size difference alone would make cohabitation impossible; the sunfish would easily overwhelm the goldfish, potentially injuring or killing it.  Furthermore, the sunfish's dietary needs and waste production would drastically differ from those of the goldfish, creating an unsuitable environment for the smaller fish.

794,Is the United States the largest exporter of Fair Trade products?,"The question asks if the United States is the largest exporter of Fair Trade products.  Fair Trade certification ensures that producers in developing countries receive fair prices for their goods, promoting ethical and sustainable practices. While the US is a significant consumer of Fair Trade products, it's not necessarily the largest exporter.  Major exporters of Fair Trade goods often include countries where the products are actually produced, such as those in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  These countries have the infrastructure and agricultural capacity to produce and export certified products in large quantities. Therefore, it is unlikely the US holds the top spot in Fair Trade exports.

796,Would you have to wear a coat when on Phobos?,"Phobos is one of Mars's moons.  Mars has a very thin atmosphere and a very cold average temperature. Phobos, being so close to Mars, would experience similarly frigid temperatures and extremely low atmospheric pressure.  This means there's very little protection from the sun's radiation and virtually no insulation from the extremely cold temperatures. To survive on Phobos, a person would absolutely require a spacesuit capable of maintaining life support (including temperature regulation) in that environment.  While a ""coat"" might offer some negligible benefit in a normal terrestrial environment, it would be completely inadequate for the conditions on Phobos.  A spacesuit is not considered a ""coat"".

798,Is watching  Star Wars necessary to know who Darth Vader is?,"Darth Vader is one of the most iconic characters in popular culture, and his image and story are widely known even outside of the Star Wars franchise.  While the full depth of his story and character arc are best understood through watching the films, his basic identity as a villainous figure in the Star Wars universe is commonly known through various forms of media and popular culture references.  Therefore, watching Star Wars is not strictly necessary to know who Darth Vader is.

Answer: {false}
"
799,Can you buy a fair trade laptop?,"The question asks if it's possible to buy a fair trade laptop.  Fair trade certification focuses on ensuring ethical labor practices and environmental sustainability throughout the supply chain of a product.  While there isn't a widely recognized ""Fair Trade Certified"" label specifically for laptops like there is for coffee or bananas, the principles of fair trade can be applied to the electronics industry.  Companies might source components ethically, pay fair wages to workers in their manufacturing process, and prioritize environmentally friendly materials and production methods.  However, verifying that every aspect of a laptop's production meets comprehensive fair trade standards is a complex challenge.  Therefore, while you can't definitively buy a laptop with a universally recognized ""fair trade"" label, it is possible to find laptops from brands that prioritize ethical sourcing and manufacturing, which aligns with the principles of fair trade.

800,Is a doctorate required to teach at a SUNY School?,"The State University of New York (SUNY) system is comprised of many different institutions, ranging from community colleges to research universities.  The requirements for teaching positions vary significantly depending on the institution, the specific department, and the level of the course being taught. While a doctorate (Ph.D. or Ed.D.) is highly desirable and often required for tenured or tenure-track positions at research-intensive universities within the SUNY system, it's not a universal requirement across all SUNY schools and positions.  Community colleges, for instance, often employ instructors with master's degrees, and some positions may even accept candidates with extensive professional experience in lieu of a doctorate.

"
801,Was the subject of Parsifal taken from British folklore?,"The opera Parsifal, composed by Richard Wagner, draws its story from the legend of the Holy Grail, a central element in Arthurian romances.  Arthurian legend is not considered British folklore in the strictest sense, though it is strongly associated with Britain and has been a major part of its cultural heritage for centuries.  The Grail stories evolved over time, incorporating elements from various sources, and were popularized across Europe, not just Britain.  While elements of British folklore might have influenced the broader Arthurian tradition, the specific story of Parsifal originates in medieval German and French sources, not exclusively British ones.

Answer: {false}
"
802,Would ramen be bad for someone with heart failure?,"Ramen noodles, especially instant varieties, are often high in sodium, saturated fat, and trans fat.  These are all detrimental to individuals with heart failure.  High sodium intake can lead to fluid retention, which worsens symptoms of heart failure.  Saturated and trans fats contribute to high cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart disease and potentially worsening heart failure.  While occasional consumption of a low-sodium, healthier version of ramen might be acceptable after consulting a doctor, regular consumption is generally discouraged for someone with heart failure.

Answer: {true}
"
803,Can French Toast hypothetically kill a Lannister?,"Explanation:
The question is hypothetical and asks whether French toast could kill a Lannister.  There is no inherent property of French toast that would cause death.  The Lannisters are a fictional family from the Game of Thrones universe, and their mortality is subject to the plot of the story. While a Lannister could theoretically die from any number of causes (poisoning, disease, violence), French toast is not a plausible cause of death for a Lannister or anyone else.

804,Is there a popular Broadway character who is a missionary?,"There isn't a widely known or popular Broadway character who is explicitly and centrally defined as a missionary.  While some characters might have missionary work as a minor aspect of their story or background, there's no iconic or famous Broadway role built around that central profession.  Many musicals feature characters with religious beliefs or who engage in acts of charity, but a dedicated missionary protagonist is not a common trope.

805,Does Carmen Electra own a junk?,"The question asks whether Carmen Electra owns a junk.  This is ambiguous.  ""Junk"" can refer to a sailboat or to something considered worthless or trash.  Without further information, it's impossible to definitively answer whether Carmen Electra owns either.  There's no readily available public information suggesting she owns a sailboat, nor is there any indication she has a large collection of worthless items.  Therefore, the answer must be based on a lack of evidence.

"
806,Are swastikas used in the most common religion in India?,"The most common religion in India is Hinduism.  While the swastika is an ancient symbol with positive connotations in some cultures, including its use in Hinduism to represent auspiciousness and good fortune, its association with Nazism and the Holocaust has overwhelmingly overshadowed its other meanings in the modern world.  Therefore, while historically present in Hinduism, its use is extremely limited and certainly not common in contemporary practice due to its negative connotations.

"
807,Did Malcolm X avoid eating ham?,"Malcolm X was a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam, a religious movement that adheres to a strict dietary code.  This dietary code, known as the ""Clean Eating"" or ""Halal"" principles within the context of the Nation of Islam, prohibits the consumption of pork.  Ham, being a pork product, would have been excluded from Malcolm X's diet during his time in the Nation of Islam.

"
811,Can a 2019 Toyota Hilux hypothetically support weight of thirty Big John Studd clones?,"Explanation:

To determine if a 2019 Toyota Hilux could support the weight of thirty Big John Studd clones, we need to estimate the weight of a Big John Studd clone and the weight capacity of a 2019 Toyota Hilux.

Big John Studd was a professional wrestler known for his large size.  While his exact weight isn't publicly available, wrestling biographies and anecdotes suggest he weighed in the range of 300-350 pounds.  Let's use an estimate of 325 pounds per clone for our calculation.

Thirty clones would weigh approximately 30 clones * 325 pounds/clone = 9750 pounds.

The 2019 Toyota Hilux has a varying payload capacity depending on the trim and configuration.  However, a reasonable estimate for the payload capacity of a Hilux is around 1500-2000 pounds.

Since 9750 pounds (weight of clones) is significantly greater than 1500-2000 pounds (estimated payload capacity), it is highly unlikely a 2019 Toyota Hilux could support the weight of thirty Big John Studd clones.

Answer: {false}
"
812,Are any minor league baseball teams named after felines?,"Several minor league baseball teams have names that incorporate felines, such as the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (though ""shrimp"" is the main focus of the name).  However, there isn't a definitive list readily available to confirm if *any* are solely and directly named after felines (e.g., ""The Lions,"" ""The Tigers,"" etc.).  The minor leagues have many teams with unique and creative names.  While some might utilize feline imagery or mascot, a team purely named after a feline is less common.  More research would be required to definitively answer.

"
813,Can telescopes hear noise?,"Telescopes are designed to detect electromagnetic radiation, primarily light, across different wavelengths (visible light, infrared, radio waves, X-rays, etc.).  They do not have the capability to detect sound waves, which are mechanical vibrations.  Sound requires a medium (like air or water) to travel, whereas the vastness of space is largely a vacuum. Therefore, telescopes cannot ""hear"" noise.

814,Is Pearl Harbor the mythical home of a shark goddess?,"Pearl Harbor is a U.S. naval base that was attacked by Japan in 1941, initiating the United States' entry into World War II.  There is no evidence or mythology connecting Pearl Harbor to a shark goddess.  The idea of a shark goddess is found in various cultures and mythologies, but it's not associated with Pearl Harbor.

Answer: {false}
"
815,Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?,"To determine which Albany will reach 100,000 occupants first, we need to compare the current populations and growth rates of Albany, Georgia, and Albany, New York.  While precise future population projections are difficult, we can look at historical trends and current population sizes.  Albany, New York, is a significantly larger city than Albany, Georgia.  It's highly unlikely that Albany, Georgia, will experience such rapid growth to surpass Albany, New York's population in the foreseeable future.

Answer: {false}
"
822,Does US brand Nice depend on Western honey bee?,"The question asks if the US brand Nice depends on the Western honey bee.  To answer this, we need to know what ""Nice"" refers to.  Assuming ""Nice"" refers to a brand of honey or a product that uses honey as an ingredient, then the answer would be likely true.  Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the primary pollinators of many plants used to produce honey.  However, if ""Nice"" refers to a completely unrelated product, the answer would be false.  Without more information about the brand ""Nice,"" a definitive answer cannot be given.  Therefore, we'll assume it's a honey-related brand.

834,Did US President during Spanish-American War suffer similar demise to Abraham Lincoln?,"The Spanish-American War (1898) was presided over by President William McKinley.  Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865. William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. While both presidents died violently, their deaths were not similar in the sense of the circumstances. Lincoln's assassination was a direct attack by a pro-Confederate sympathizer, John Wilkes Booth,  motivated by the Civil War. McKinley's assassination was by an anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, whose motive was less clearly connected to a specific political agenda.  The methods of assassination also differed significantly.  Lincoln was shot in the head while attending a play; McKinley was shot at point-blank range during a public reception.

837,"In geometry terms, is the Royal Observatory in Greenwich similar to a yield sign?","The Royal Observatory in Greenwich is a three-dimensional structure, complex in shape, and features many varying angles and curves.  A yield sign is a two-dimensional, relatively simple geometric shape (typically an equilateral triangle).  While one might be able to find *some* superficial resemblance (perhaps in the general triangular shape of some parts of the observatory's buildings from certain viewpoints), the objects are fundamentally dissimilar geometrically. They do not share similar angles, proportions, or overall structure in any meaningful geometric sense.  Therefore, they are not similar in geometry terms.

Answer: {false}
"
838,Do movies always show nerds as the losers?,"Movie portrayals of nerds are varied and have evolved over time.

839,Could JPMorgan Chase give every American $10?,"To determine if JPMorgan Chase could give every American $10, we need to consider JPMorgan Chase's assets and the US population.

JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest banks in the world, with trillions of dollars in assets.  However,  giving every American $10 requires a calculation.  As of 2023, the US population is approximately 335 million people.  Therefore, to give every American $10 would cost approximately $3.35 billion.  While this is a significant sum, it's a small fraction of JPMorgan Chase's overall assets.  The bank could easily afford this.

841,Would Dante Alighieri hypothetically place Rupert Murdoch in 8th Circle of Hell?,"Dante Alighieri's Inferno describes the eight circle of Hell as Malebolge, a series of ten concentric ditches reserved for fraudsters.  Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul, has faced accusations of unethical and manipulative business practices, including accusations of spreading misinformation and promoting harmful narratives through his media empire.  Given Dante's focus on fraud and deceit in the eighth circle, and considering the accusations leveled against Murdoch, it's plausible that Dante might place him there.

843,Could a dichromat probably easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas?,"Chlorine gas is yellowish-green, while neon gas is reddish-orange.  A dichromat, someone with impaired color vision, might have difficulty distinguishing between these two colors, depending on the specific type and severity of their dichromacy.  However, the difference in hue is significant enough that many dichromats would likely still be able to perceive a difference, although the exact shades perceived might vary from person to person and from the norm.  Therefore, while it's not guaranteed, it's more probable a dichromat could distinguish them than not.

845,Was Darth Vader monogamous?,"Answer: Darth Vader was married to Padmé Amidala, but their relationship ended with her death.  He later showed no romantic attachments and focused on his role in the Empire. While he didn't have other romantic relationships shown in the films, the evidence suggests he was not actively seeking them out after Padme's death.  His primary focus was on the Empire and his own power.  Therefore, while he had one marriage, the description of ""monogamous"" implies a sustained, ongoing commitment to one partner. This is not depicted in the narrative.

862,Would a Jehovah's witness approve of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"Jehovah's Witnesses generally avoid media that promotes spiritism, occultism, or the supernatural.  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland features numerous fantastical and magical elements, including talking animals, a Mad Hatter's tea party, and encounters with various mythical creatures.  These elements could be interpreted as promoting or glorifying concepts that conflict with Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs.  Therefore, a Jehovah's Witness likely would not approve of the book.

865,Is Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution popular in court?,"The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishments.  Its application in court is complex and frequently litigated.  While not universally popular in the sense of always resulting in a desired outcome for defendants,  it is a foundational legal principle regularly invoked in court challenges to sentencing, conditions of confinement, and capital punishment.  Its interpretation and application are constantly debated and evolve through court decisions, making it a significant and frequently used part of the legal process.  Therefore, it's considered a frequently used and influential amendment in the court system.

871,Would a blooming onion be possible with a shallot?,"A blooming onion requires a large onion to be sliced in a specific pattern to create the ""blooming"" effect.  Shallots are much smaller and have a different structure than onions.  The size and shape of a shallot would make it impossible to create the same blooming effect as with a large onion.  Therefore, a blooming onion is not possible with a shallot.

"
872,"In isopropyl alcohol, is the solubility of salt low?","Isopropyl alcohol is a polar solvent, but its polarity is lower than that of water.  Salt (typically sodium chloride, NaCl) is an ionic compound that dissolves well in polar solvents due to strong ion-dipole interactions.  While isopropyl alcohol can dissolve some salt, its lower polarity compared to water means the solubility of salt in isopropyl alcohol is significantly lower than in water.  The ion-dipole interactions are weaker, resulting in less effective solvation of the salt ions.

874,Can I build a house on an asteroid?,"Explanation:

Currently, building a house on an asteroid is not feasible with existing technology.  The challenges are immense:

* **Transportation:** Getting the necessary materials and construction equipment to an asteroid would be incredibly expensive and technologically challenging.  Current rocket technology is not capable of transporting large amounts of material to asteroids efficiently.

* **Gravity:** Asteroids generally lack significant gravity. This makes it extremely difficult to maintain a stable structure and for humans to live and work there.  Artificial gravity would need to be created, which is a hugely complex undertaking.

* **Radiation:** Asteroids lack the atmospheric protection of Earth, leaving inhabitants exposed to harmful levels of solar and cosmic radiation. Shielding would be required, adding to the weight and complexity of the structure.

* **Resources:**  Finding and utilizing resources on the asteroid for construction and sustaining life would require advanced technology and significant exploration.

* **Temperature Extremes:** Asteroids experience extreme temperature fluctuations.  Constructing and maintaining a habitable environment would be incredibly challenging.

* **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** The ownership and exploitation of asteroids are governed by international space law, which is still developing.

"
879,Is polyamory allowed in the Catholic Church?,"The Catholic Church holds a traditional view of marriage as a lifelong union exclusively between one man and one woman.  Polyamory, by definition, involves intimate relationships with more than one partner. This directly contradicts the Church's doctrine on marriage and sexuality.  Therefore, polyamorous relationships are not allowed or condoned within the Catholic Church.

Answer: {false}
"
880,Are there mental disorders you can hide?,"Mental disorders are complex and vary greatly in their presentation. Some mental disorders may be easier to conceal than others, depending on the symptoms and the individual's ability to manage them.  For example, a person with social anxiety might be able to effectively mask their anxiety in certain social situations, while someone experiencing a psychotic episode may have more visible symptoms.  The severity of the disorder and the individual's coping mechanisms also play a significant role. However, it is important to note that even if a person can successfully hide the symptoms of a mental disorder, the underlying condition still exists and can significantly impact their well-being.  It's not about the ability to hide it, but rather the fact that many mental health conditions are not always outwardly apparent.  There's a difference between not displaying outward symptoms and successfully ""hiding"" a disorder.

883,Do people with mood disorders need permanent institutionalization?,"Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, vary greatly in severity and impact on an individual's life.  While some individuals with severe mood disorders may require periods of hospitalization for stabilization and treatment,  permanent institutionalization is not a typical or necessary treatment for the vast majority of people with mood disorders.  Many individuals can effectively manage their conditions through therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes, enabling them to live fulfilling lives within their communities.  Permanent institutionalization is generally reserved for individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses that pose a significant risk to themselves or others, and even then, it's considered a last resort and strives for the least restrictive environment possible.

885,Do you need to schedule separate preventive healthcare and sickness visits?,"Explanation:
Preventive healthcare focuses on preventing illness through measures like checkups, vaccinations, and screenings.  Sickness visits, on the other hand, address existing health problems.

Many individuals may have separate appointments for preventive care and for treatment of illness.

Answer: {false}
"
886,Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?,"Explanation:
To answer this question, we need to know the fat content of a McDonald's hamburger and the USDA recommended daily fat allowance.  Let's assume, for simplicity, that a McDonald's hamburger contains approximately 10 grams of fat (this number can vary slightly depending on the specific hamburger and preparation).  The USDA recommends a daily fat intake that varies based on age, gender, activity level and caloric needs.  However, for a general adult, a commonly cited range for total fat intake is between 44-78 grams per day, or an average of 61 grams.

Seven McDonald's hamburgers would contain approximately 70 grams of fat (7 hamburgers * 10 grams/hamburger).  This exceeds the lower end of the recommended daily fat intake for many adults, and is close to the upper end.

Therefore, it's likely that seven McDonald's hamburgers would exceed the USDA's recommended daily fat allowance for many individuals, but not universally for everyone.  However, for the sake of a definitive answer let's focus on if it exceeds the lower limit.


Answer: {true}
"
887,Would Edward II of England have been born without Vikings?,"Edward II of England's ancestry can be traced back through a long line of Norman and Anglo-Saxon kings and queens.  While the Vikings had a significant impact on the British Isles, particularly England, through invasions and settlement during the Viking Age (roughly 793-1066 AD), Edward II's lineage doesn't directly involve Vikings. His ancestry is primarily French and English,  predating the significant Viking influence on England by several centuries.  While some distant ancestors *might* have had some Viking heritage, this would be extremely tenuous and insufficient to claim that he wouldn't have been born without Vikings.

Answer: {false}
"
888,Are implants from an ORIF surgery affected by the magnetic field of the Earth?,"Explanation:
Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) surgery involves the use of metal implants (plates, screws, rods) to stabilize broken bones.  These implants are typically made of metals like titanium, stainless steel, or alloys thereof.  While these metals *can* be slightly affected by magnetic fields, the Earth's magnetic field is relatively weak. The force exerted by the Earth's magnetic field on these implants is negligible and would not cause any noticeable or clinically significant effect on the implants or the patient.  The forces involved in daily life (gravity, movement) are far more significant.

891,"Is 2018 Ashland, Oregon population inadequate to be a hypothetical military division?","To determine if Ashland, Oregon's 2018 population is inadequate to be a hypothetical military division, we need to consider the size of a typical military division and compare it to Ashland's population in 2018.  A military division typically comprises tens of thousands of personnel, significantly more than a small city's population.  Ashland, Oregon, had a population significantly less than that in 2018.  Therefore, Ashland's population in 2018 would be far too small to constitute a military division.

893,Are aggressive bumblebees suicidal?,"Aggression in bumblebees is a defensive mechanism, not a suicidal act.  While a bumblebee might sting in defense, the act itself doesn't lead to its death like it does for honeybees (whose stinger is barbed).  Bumblebees can sting multiple times without dying.  Therefore, their aggression, while potentially dangerous to the target, is not inherently self-destructive.

Answer: {false}
"
894,Does Mercury make for good Slip N Slide material?,"Mercury is a highly toxic metal that is liquid at room temperature.  Using it as a Slip N Slide material would be incredibly dangerous and irresponsible.  The toxicity of mercury means any skin contact should be avoided.

"
895,Could a Bengal cat hypothetically best Javier Sotomayor's record?,"Explanation: Javier Sotomayor's world record high jump is 2.45 meters.  A Bengal cat is a domesticated cat and cannot jump anywhere near that height.  The average domestic cat jump height is roughly 6 times their body length, while a record-breaking cat can reach approximately 8 times their body length.  Even assuming a very large Bengal cat and an exceptionally high jump for a cat, it would still fall far short of 2.45 meters.

"
896,Is most store bought rice pudding made with brown rice?,"Most store-bought rice pudding uses white rice, not brown rice.  Brown rice has a more assertive flavor and firmer texture than white rice, which would not be ideal for the creamy texture typically associated with rice pudding. White rice cooks more quickly and results in a smoother, creamier consistency preferred in commercially produced rice pudding.  While some specialty brands might offer brown rice pudding, it's not the norm for mass-produced products.

898,Were number of states in Ancient Greece underwhelming compared to US states in 1900?,"Ancient Greece was comprised of numerous independent city-states, not unified under a single governing structure like the modern United States. While the exact number of city-states varied throughout history and depended on the definition used, it was significantly less than the 45 states in the US by 1900. The independent city-states were often small in territory, whereas US states cover vast geographical areas.  Therefore, the number of states in Ancient Greece was underwhelming compared to the US states in 1900.

912,Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?,"To determine if the box office receipts of the 2017 Wonder Woman film could cover the cost of a Boeing 737, we need to compare the film's revenue to the price of a Boeing 737.

* **Wonder Woman (2017) Box Office Revenue:**  The film grossed significantly more than $821 million worldwide.

* **Cost of a Boeing 737:** The price of a new Boeing 737 varies greatly depending on the model and customization, but it generally falls within a range of $80 million to $120 million.

Since the box office revenue of Wonder Woman (2017) greatly exceeds the cost of a Boeing 737, the answer is true.

916,Do Shivambu practitioners believe ammonia is unhealthy?,"Shivambu is a practice within tantra yoga that involves retaining urine within the body and then reabsorbing it.  Practitioners believe that urine contains beneficial substances and that reabsorbing it offers various health benefits.  Given this belief system, it's highly unlikely that Shivambu practitioners would consider ammonia, a byproduct of urine decomposition, to be healthy.  The core principle of Shivambu is about utilizing the supposed benefits of *fresh* urine, implying a rejection of the deteriorated, ammonia-containing form.

Answer: {true}
"
917,Is starving Hamas agent eating pig bad?,"The question presents a complex moral dilemma.  While eating pork is forbidden in Islam, which is the faith associated with Hamas, the act of a starving person consuming pork to survive is arguably a matter of self-preservation overriding religious dietary restrictions.  The act is not inherently ""bad"" in the context of survival.  The focus should be on the dire circumstances forcing the individual to make such a choice, rather than judging the act itself in a vacuum.

923,Would Harvey Milk have approved of Obama?,"Harvey Milk was a prominent gay rights activist who championed equality and inclusion.  Barack Obama, as president, took significant steps to advance LGBTQ+ rights, including repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and supporting marriage equality.  Given Milk's activism and Obama's policies, it's highly likely that Milk would have approved of Obama's stance on LGBTQ+ issues and other progressive policies.

"
925,Did Rumi spend his time in a state of euphoria?,"Rumi's poetry frequently speaks of ecstatic states, spiritual union, and profound joy.  However, to say he *spent his time* in a constant state of euphoria is an oversimplification.  While his spiritual journey involved moments of intense bliss and connection, it also likely included periods of introspection, contemplation, struggle, and even sorrow, as is common in the human experience, particularly on a spiritual path.  Euphoria is a state, not a constant condition.  It would be inaccurate to suggest he was perpetually in such a state.

Answer: {false}
"
926,Would dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry be useful if performed on a crab?,"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a technique primarily used to measure bone mineral density in humans and sometimes animals with similar skeletal structures.  It works by using X-rays to differentiate between bone, soft tissue, and fat.  Crabs have exoskeletons made of chitin, not bone.  The DEXA scan wouldn't be able to accurately measure bone mineral density because there is no bone to measure.  While it might show the overall density of the crab's body, it wouldn't provide the specific information DEXA is designed for.  Therefore, it would not be a useful application of the technology.

Answer: {false}
"
927,Would an aerodynamic cactus benefit from more frequently closed stomata?,"Aerodynamic cacti, by their design, aim to minimize wind resistance.  This implies a streamlined shape, often tall and slender.  Stomata are tiny pores on the surface of a plant, primarily used for gas exchange (taking in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and releasing oxygen and water vapor).  Closed stomata reduce water loss through transpiration, a crucial adaptation for cacti in arid environments.  However, closed stomata also limit carbon dioxide uptake, hindering photosynthesis.

An aerodynamic cactus, while needing to conserve water, also needs to photosynthesize to survive.  More frequent closure of stomata would mean less time for photosynthesis and therefore less energy production.  While reducing water loss is beneficial, completely closing stomata too often would negatively impact growth and survival.  Therefore, a balance is needed, and not more frequent closure.

"
930,Could every citizen of Samoa send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee?,"To determine if every citizen of Samoa could send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee, we need to compare the population of Samoa to the number of JPMorgan Chase employees.

Let's find some data:

* **Population of Samoa:**  The population of Samoa is roughly 200,000.  This number can fluctuate slightly depending on the source and year.
* **Number of JPMorgan Chase Employees:** JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest banks in the world, employing hundreds of thousands of people.  Exact figures vary by year and source but are likely to be in the hundreds of thousands or even over one million.

If JPMorgan Chase has significantly more employees than the population of Samoa, then it's theoretically possible for every citizen of Samoa to send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee.

However, it's crucial to note that this is a theoretical possibility.  It doesn't account for practical considerations such as:

* **Employee turnover:** The employee roster changes constantly.
* **Access to employee information:** Obtaining a comprehensive list of every JPMorgan Chase employee with their contact details would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the average Samoan citizen.
* **Logistics:** The sheer volume of letters would create logistical challenges.


Given the likely disparity between the population of Samoa and the number of JPMorgan Chase employees, we can infer that it *is theoretically possible*, however the practical reality makes it highly improbable.  For the sake of the question and based on the vastly larger likely size of JPMorgan Chase's workforce, we'll proceed with a ""yes"" answer.

"
932,Does Kenny G hold the qualifications to be a tax collector?,"Answer: To determine if Kenny G holds the qualifications to be a tax collector, we need to consider the requirements for such a position.  These requirements vary by jurisdiction but generally include things like a high school diploma or equivalent, passing a background check, and potentially specific accounting or financial knowledge.  There's no public information suggesting Kenny G possesses a background in tax collection or holds the necessary certifications.  His fame is in music, not in finance or governmental administration. Therefore, it's highly unlikely he meets the necessary qualifications.

"
933,Are Sable's a good choice of Mustelidae to weigh down a scale?,"Sables are a type of Mustelidae, which are weasels.  They are relatively small animals.  While the exact weight varies, they are unlikely to weigh enough to significantly impact a scale unless the scale is very sensitive or you're using a large number of sables.  Therefore, they are not a good choice for weighing down a scale unless you need a very small weight.

935,Is Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars associated with the color black?,"Answer: Anakin Skywalker, later Darth Vader, is strongly associated with the color black.  His transformation into Darth Vader involves him donning a completely black suit.

The imagery of black is consistently used to visually represent his character arc and affiliation with the dark side of the Force.

Answer: {true}
"
936,Was story of Jesus inspired by Egyptian myth?,"Several parallels have been drawn between the life and teachings of Jesus and various figures and myths from ancient Egypt, particularly those surrounding Osiris, Horus, and Isis.  These parallels include:

* **Virgin Birth:**  The conception of Horus through Isis, without sexual intercourse, mirrors the virgin birth of Jesus.
* **Death and Resurrection:** Osiris's death and resurrection symbolize rebirth and the cycle of nature, a theme echoed in the Christian belief of Jesus's resurrection.
* **Crucifixion:** While not directly a crucifixion, Osiris's dismemberment and subsequent reassembly can be interpreted as a parallel to the suffering and death of Jesus.
* **Miracles:**  Both Jesus and Horus are attributed with performing miracles.
* **Divine Son:** Both Jesus and Horus are depicted as divine sons, with Jesus being the Son of God and Horus the son of Osiris.

It's crucial to note that these are *parallels*, not definitive proof of direct inspiration.  Many cultures throughout history have featured myths involving divine figures who suffer, die, and are resurrected, reflecting universal human hopes and fears. The existence of parallels does not automatically imply direct influence or borrowing.  The narratives evolved and were interpreted differently within their specific cultural and religious contexts.  While some scholars suggest possible influence, others argue for independent development of similar themes.  Therefore, claiming a direct inspiration is an overstatement.

"
938,Can you make an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge?,"To create an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge would require converting some aspect of the bridge into a sound wave.  The bridge itself doesn't inherently produce sound in a way that can be directly recorded into an MP3.  Therefore, one would need to find a way to translate some characteristic of the bridge into an audio signal.  This could theoretically be done by:

* **Analyzing structural vibrations:**  Sensors could be placed on the bridge to measure vibrations caused by wind, traffic, or seismic activity. These vibrations could then be converted into an audio frequency range and saved as an MP3.  This would result in a soundscape representing the bridge's physical response to its environment.
* **Visual representation:**  The bridge's image could be processed algorithmically.  Different aspects of the image (color, texture, etc.) could be mapped to different frequencies, generating a soundscape based on the bridge's visual appearance.
* **Using the bridge's data:**  Information about the bridge (e.g., its dimensions, construction materials, etc.) could be encoded into an audio signal. This would be an abstract representation, not a direct ""sound"" of the bridge.


While technically possible through these indirect methods, it wouldn't be a recording of the bridge making a sound in the traditional sense.

Answer: {false}
"
939,Can the Great Depression be treated with Prozac?,"The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s.  It was a period of widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest, caused by a complex interplay of economic factors, not a mental health condition. Prozac is an antidepressant medication used to treat conditions like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  It has no relevance to the economic causes or effects of the Great Depression.  Therefore, the Great Depression cannot be treated with Prozac.

"
945,Would half muggle wizards fear Lord Voldemort?,"Answer:  Muggle-born wizards would likely fear Lord Voldemort due to his power and cruelty.  Half-blood wizards, depending on their upbringing and beliefs, might also fear him.  However, not all half-blood or muggle-born wizards would necessarily fear him. Some might be brave enough to oppose him, or perhaps simply unaware of the full extent of his power.  Therefore, it's unlikely that *half* of them would be afraid, but a significant portion probably would.

Answer: {false}
"
946,Could the endowment of Johns Hopkins University pay off the MBTA debt?,"Here's an explanation to determine if Johns Hopkins University's endowment could pay off the MBTA's debt:

To answer this question, we need to compare the size of Johns Hopkins University's endowment to the amount of the MBTA's debt.  We need to find reliable, up-to-date figures for both.  The endowment of Johns Hopkins University fluctuates, and the MBTA debt changes as well.  Finding the exact current figures would require consulting recent financial reports from both institutions.  If the endowment's value is greater than or equal to the MBTA's debt, then the answer is yes.  If the endowment's value is less than the MBTA's debt, then the answer is no.

Without access to real-time financial data, a definitive answer cannot be given.

"
947,Would East India Company prefer China's modern trade?,"The East India Company was a powerful trading company that operated in Asia from the 17th to the 19th centuries.  Its primary focus was on controlling trade routes and resources, particularly in India and surrounding regions.  China, while a significant trading partner, was also a major source of frustration for the Company due to its restrictive trade policies (specifically the Canton System) that limited access to Chinese markets and heavily favored China. The East India Company desired broader access to Chinese goods and markets.  China's modern trade practices are vastly different, with open markets and extensive global trade participation. Considering the East India Company's history and goals, it would almost certainly prefer the dramatically more open and accessible trading environment of modern China to the restrictive and tightly controlled system it faced historically.

"
953,Does The Jungle Book contain racist subtext?,"Rudyard Kipling's *The Jungle Book*, while a beloved children's story, contains elements that can be interpreted as reflecting the racist attitudes prevalent in British colonial society during the time of its writing.  The portrayal of animals often utilizes anthropomorphism to project human characteristics and societal structures onto the animal kingdom.  Some interpretations argue that the depiction of certain animals, particularly monkeys, reinforces negative stereotypes about non-white populations.  The ""man-cub"" Mowgli's journey and his eventual return to human society could be seen as reflecting a colonial narrative of civilizing the ""savage"" or ""uncivilized.""  While not explicitly stating racist views, the subtext and underlying assumptions of the story are open to critical analysis and interpretation as reflecting the colonial mindset of its era.

958,Can the Communist Party of the Soviet Union get a perfect all kill?,"The question asks if the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) could achieve a ""perfect all kill,"" a term typically used in gaming contexts to mean complete annihilation or victory.  Applying this metaphor to the CPSU's history requires considering their political and military power. While the CPSU held immense power during the Cold War and controlled a vast territory, a ""perfect all kill"" implies complete and utter dominance without any opposition or negative consequences, which is impossible in reality.  The CPSU faced internal dissent, external threats, economic struggles, and ultimately, collapse. Therefore, achieving a ""perfect all kill"" in any meaningful sense was impossible.

961,Would students at Marist have to petition to get a rowing team?,"Marist College is a small liberal arts college.  The existence of a varsity rowing team at a college usually depends on several factors including student interest, available resources (funding, coaching staff, equipment), and existing athletic department structure and priorities. While there might be a process for students to propose new teams, it's not guaranteed that a petition alone would be sufficient to establish a team.  The college administration would need to assess feasibility and resource allocation.  Therefore, while students *could* petition, it wouldn't guarantee the creation of a rowing team.

Answer: {false}
"
962,Would Ibn Saud tolerate salsa music?,"Ibn Saud was a deeply conservative Wahhabi Muslim who ruled Saudi Arabia from 1932 to 1953.  Wahhabism is a strict and puritanical interpretation of Islam that discourages many forms of music and dance considered to be frivolous or non-religious. Salsa music, with its origins in Afro-Cuban culture and its association with dancing and social gatherings, would likely have been considered inappropriate and possibly even forbidden within the highly conservative social context of Ibn Saud's reign.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that he would have tolerated it.

973,Is number of different US President's in 1800s a lucky number in Hong Kong?,"The 1800s spanned from 1801 to 1900.  There were 19 different US presidents during this time.

In Hong Kong, lucky numbers are often associated with Cantonese pronunciation and their similar sounds to words signifying good fortune.  There's no widely established list of universally ""lucky"" numbers in Hong Kong culture in the same way there might be in some other cultures.  The number 19 itself doesn't have any particular positive or negative connotation in Hong Kong culture based on readily available information.  Therefore, whether 19 is considered ""lucky"" is subjective and not definitively tied to Hong Kong cultural norms.

977,Did Hanuman ever experience an orgasm?,"Answer: The question asks about Hanuman's experience of an orgasm.  Hanuman is a central figure in the Hindu epic Ramayana, known for his devotion, strength, and service to Lord Rama.  While the Ramayana details many aspects of Hanuman's life and actions, it doesn't include any explicit or implicit references to his sexual experiences or any physical experience like orgasm.  The focus is on his spiritual journey and his role in the larger narrative.  Therefore, based on the available textual evidence, it's highly unlikely that the Ramayana describes such a thing.

978,Do onions have a form that resembles the inside of a tree?,"Onions are layered, with concentric rings forming their structure.  While not identical to the inside of a tree, the layered structure bears a resemblance to the rings visible in a cross-section of a tree trunk.  These rings represent years of growth, similar to how the layers of an onion represent stages of its growth. The resemblance is more in the overall pattern of concentric circles than in the exact cellular composition of the two structures.

983,"In the world of Harry Potter, would a snake and skull tattoo be good luck?","In the Harry Potter universe, snakes are strongly associated with Slytherin house and dark magic, while skulls are generally symbolic of death and danger.  Neither symbol is associated with good luck. In fact, a snake might be interpreted as a sign of Parseltongue, a skill that, while impressive, is also linked to dark wizards. Therefore, a combination of these two symbols would likely be considered quite unlucky, rather than lucky.

Answer: {false}
"
984,Is Alan Alda old enough to have fought in the Vietnam War?,"Alan Alda was born on January 28, 1936. The Vietnam War took place from 1955 to 1975.  To have fought in the Vietnam War, he would have needed to be of military age (typically 18-26) during that period.  Given his birth year, he would have been too young to have served at the start of the war and likely too old towards its end.  Let's check the ages:

* **Start of Vietnam War (1955):** Alda would have been 19 years old.  This is within the possible age range for military service.
* **End of Vietnam War (1975):** Alda would have been 39 years old. This is far outside the typical age range for military service.

While it's possible he could have served earlier in the war, he would have been too old to serve later in the war.  It is important to note that there may be exceptions to the age requirements for military service based on specific circumstances. However, based on his age and the general age requirements for military service during the Vietnam War, it's unlikely he fought in the war.

985,Does title of Van Morrison's most played song apply to a minority of women worldwide?,"Van Morrison's most played song is ""Brown Eyed Girl.""  While ""brown eyed girl"" is not a specific demographic, it refers to a common eye color.  A significant portion of women worldwide have brown eyes.  Therefore, the title would apply to a majority, not a minority, of women.

Answer: {false}
"
986,Did Snoop Dogg refuse to make music with rival gang members?,"Snoop Dogg's career is deeply intertwined with gang culture, specifically the Crips.  While he has collaborated with numerous artists, his affiliations might have influenced his choices in collaborators.  However, there's no readily available public information definitively stating he *refused* to collaborate with artists affiliated with rival gangs. His collaborations have spanned a wide range of artists, suggesting a focus on musical synergy rather than an absolute avoidance of artists with opposing gang ties.  It's possible he has chosen not to work with certain individuals, but without specific evidence, it's impossible to confirm a blanket refusal based solely on gang affiliations.

"
987,Would Othello be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade most time with king?,"Explanation:
The question asks whether Othello is the Shakespeare play that would allow one to spend the most time with the king (presumably referring to Shahryar in the *One Thousand and One Nights* story).  This question is nonsensical.  Shakespeare's *Othello* is unrelated to the *One Thousand and One Nights* and has nothing to do with how much time Scheherazade could spend with the king. The premise is faulty and there is no logical connection between the two.

Answer: {false}
"
988,Are goldfish more difficult to care for than isopods?,"Goldfish require a significantly more complex and demanding care environment than isopods.  Goldfish need a large, filtered aquarium with specific water parameters (temperature, pH, etc.), regular water changes, and a proper diet.  Isopods, on the other hand, are much less demanding, thriving in simple, small enclosures with minimal maintenance.  They require less space, less specialized food, and less frequent cleaning.  The care requirements for goldfish far exceed those of isopods.

Answer: {true}
"
989,Did Easy Rider make a profit at the theater when it was released?,"Easy Rider, despite its critical acclaim and cult following, did not make a large profit at the box office during its initial theatrical release. While it grossed a significant amount, it did not recoup its production costs, marketing costs, and distribution costs.  The film's success was largely post-theatrical through home video and other distribution methods.  Therefore, it is false to say it made a profit in theaters.

Answer: {false}
"
990,Could Katharine Hepburn have ridden the AirTrain JFK?,"Katharine Hepburn's career spanned from the 1930s to the 1990s.  The AirTrain JFK opened in 2003. Therefore, Katharine Hepburn could not have ridden the AirTrain JFK.

"
991,Do most high school head coaches make as much as the Head Coach at NCSU?,"High school head coaches' salaries vary widely depending on the school's location, size, and the sport coached.  While some high-profile high school coaches in affluent areas might earn substantial salaries,  the vast majority earn significantly less than the head coach at a major university like North Carolina State University (NCSU). NCSU's head football coach, for example,  receives a multi-million dollar compensation package that includes salary, bonuses, and endorsements.  This level of compensation is far beyond the reach of almost all high school head coaches.

Answer: {false}
"
992,Has the Indian Ocean garbage patch not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery?,"The Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010.  It takes approximately 6 years to complete one rotation.  Therefore, since its discovery in 2010, it would have completed approximately (2024-2010)/6 = 2.33 rotations. This is more than two full rotations.


Answer: {false}
"
993,Can children be soldiers in the US Army?,"The US military has age requirements for enlistment.  While the exact age varies depending on the branch of service and the specific role, there is no provision for children to serve as soldiers.  The minimum age is generally 18, though some exceptions may exist for those with parental consent (rare and generally only for specific roles and under strict conditions) but these would not be considered ""children"" in the common sense of the word.  Therefore, children cannot be soldiers in the US Army.

994,Can you use the T-Mobile tuesdays app if you aren't a T-Mobile customer?,"The T-Mobile Tuesdays app is designed as a loyalty program exclusively for T-Mobile customers.  Its purpose is to reward existing subscribers with various deals and offers.  Non-T-Mobile customers wouldn't have the account necessary to log in and access the app's features.  Therefore, the app is not intended for use by those who aren't T-Mobile subscribers.

"
995,Are multiple Christmas Carol's named after Saints?,"Several Christmas carols are named after saints.  For example, ""O Come, All Ye Faithful"" (also known as ""Adeste Fideles"") is associated with Saint John the Evangelist. While not explicitly named after a saint in the title, the carol's lyrics and historical connection strongly tie it to a saint.  Other examples might exist depending on the specific carol collections considered.  Therefore, the statement is likely true, though definitive proof requires a more exhaustive search across a broad range of Christmas carols.

Answer: {true}
"
996,Would George Fox support stoning?,"George Fox was the founder of the Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers.  Quakers are known for their pacifism and belief in the inherent worth of all individuals.  Stoning is a violent and capital form of punishment, directly contradicting Quaker beliefs in peace and non-violence.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely George Fox would have supported stoning.

Answer: {false}
"
997,"Is an inappropriate lullaby Love Song from November 11, 2000?","The question asks if ""Love Song"" from November 11, 2000 is an inappropriate lullaby.  To answer this, we need to know the content of the song ""Love Song"" released on that date.  There is no widely known song with that title and release date that would be inherently unsuitable as a lullaby.  Without further information on the specific song's lyrics and themes, we cannot determine if it would be considered inappropriate.  Therefore, the answer must be based on a lack of sufficient information.

1001,Is an internet connection essential for someone using Chrome OS?,"Chrome OS is designed to be heavily reliant on an internet connection.  While some offline functionality exists (like accessing downloaded files and some limited apps), the core functionality of Chrome OS, including accessing apps from the Chrome Web Store and many built-in features, requires an internet connection.  Without it, the operating system's capabilities are severely limited.

"
1002,Was Harry Potter a better investment than The Matrix for Warner Bros.?,"To determine whether Harry Potter was a better investment than The Matrix for Warner Bros., we need to consider the overall profitability of each franchise.  While precise financial figures are not publicly available,  the Harry Potter franchise generated significantly more revenue across multiple films, merchandise, theme parks, and other ventures than The Matrix franchise.  The Matrix, while critically acclaimed and commercially successful, did not achieve the same level of sustained global popularity and revenue generation as Harry Potter.  Therefore, based on the scale and longevity of its success, Harry Potter was almost certainly a better investment for Warner Bros.

Answer: {true}
"
1003,Is retail a job anybody can be suited for?,"Retail jobs encompass a wide variety of roles, from cashiers and stock clerks to sales associates and managers.  While some roles require minimal prior experience or skills, others demand specific expertise or personality traits.  Some individuals thrive in fast-paced, customer-facing environments, while others find such settings stressful.  Certain positions necessitate strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork abilities. Therefore, while entry-level positions are relatively accessible, not everyone possesses the aptitude or personality to succeed and find fulfillment in all aspects of retail work.

Answer: {false}
"
1004,Is a paleo dieter unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day?,"A paleo diet typically restricts processed foods and added sugars.  Many green food colorings used in beverages are artificial and would therefore be excluded from a paleo diet.  Therefore, a person following a strict paleo diet would be unlikely to use artificial green food coloring in their beverages.

Answer: {true}
"
1005,NATO doesn't recognize double triangle flag countries?,"NATO's recognition of countries is based on their sovereign status and adherence to the alliance's principles, not on their flags.  The shape or design of a national flag is irrelevant to NATO membership.  Therefore, whether a country uses a double triangle flag or any other flag design has no bearing on whether NATO recognizes it.

"
1008,Has Johns Hopkins University always treated subjects ethically?,"Johns Hopkins University has a long and complex history. While it has a strong reputation for research and education,  it has also been involved in ethically questionable research practices, particularly in the early to mid-20th century.  Famous examples include the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which involved the unethical withholding of treatment from African American men with syphilis.  While the university has since implemented stricter ethical review processes, its past actions demonstrate that ethical treatment of subjects has not always been consistently prioritized throughout its entire history.

Answer: {false}
"
1009,Is University of Pittsburgh easier to enter than FBI?,"The University of Pittsburgh and the FBI represent vastly different selection processes.  The University of Pittsburgh is a university with admissions standards based on academic performance, standardized test scores (depending on the year and program), and other application materials.  While competitive, admission depends on meeting certain criteria and demonstrating academic potential.

The FBI, on the other hand, is a federal law enforcement agency with a highly selective hiring process.  It requires a rigorous background check, physical fitness tests, polygraph examinations, and extensive training.  Acceptance into the FBI is incredibly competitive and requires specific qualifications beyond academic achievement.  The skills and requirements are vastly different.

Therefore, it's far easier to gain admission to the University of Pittsburgh than to become a Special Agent with the FBI.

1012,Would a Wolverine and a Lynx be hard to tell apart?,"Both wolverines and lynxes are mustelids with similar builds and habitats, leading to occasional confusion.  However, key differences exist. Wolverines are stockier, with shorter legs and a more rounded head.  Lynxes have longer legs and ears with prominent tufts.  Their fur patterns also differ. While both have some brown and tan coloring, their patterning and the presence or absence of specific markings, like the distinctive dark facial markings of a wolverine, can aid in distinction.  Therefore, while superficial similarities can make them hard to tell apart at a glance, especially at a distance or in poor light, careful observation of size, leg length, head shape, ear tufts, and fur markings can allow for clear identification.

Answer: {false}
"
1013,Can Amtrak's Acela Express break the sound barrier?,"The Acela Express is a high-speed train, but it is not capable of supersonic speeds.  The speed of sound varies depending on altitude and temperature, but it's generally around 767 mph. The Acela Express's maximum speed is significantly lower than that. Therefore, it cannot break the sound barrier.

Answer: {true}
"
1015,Can a strawberry get worms similar to dogs?,"Strawberries, like many fruits and vegetables, can be infested with larvae of various insects.  These larvae, while sometimes referred to colloquially as ""worms,"" are not the same type of parasite as those that infect dogs. Dogs get internal parasites like roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms, which are complex organisms with specific life cycles involving ingestion of eggs or larvae.  Strawberry ""worms"" are typically the larvae of insects like the strawberry crown borer or other pests that feed on the fruit and its plant. While both involve parasites, the organisms are vastly different and the infestation mechanisms are dissimilar.  The term ""worm"" is a very general term and should not be equated between plant and animal contexts without consideration of the specific organisms involved.

1017,Does it seem like the Gorillaz is composed of more members than they have?,"Gorillaz is presented as a virtual band with four core members: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs.  However, the band's history involves numerous collaborators and guest vocalists who contribute to their music and overall image.  While only four are considered the main characters, the sheer number of musicians involved in creating their albums makes it seem like there are many more members than the core four.

Answer: {false}
"
1020,Do Squidward Tentacles and Alan Greenspan have different musical passions?,"Squidward Tentacles, from Spongebob Squarepants, is depicted as a clarinet player with a passion for classical music and a disdain for popular music.  Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, has shown no public indication of a strong interest in any particular musical genre. While it's impossible to definitively know his personal musical preferences, it's safe to assume his musical passions, if any, would differ from Squidward's classical leanings.  Therefore, it is highly probable they have different musical passions.

Answer: {true}
"
1021,Is the Louvre's pyramid known for being unbreakable?,"The Louvre's pyramid, while a striking architectural feat, is not known for being unbreakable.

"
1023,Was England directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict?,"England, as part of the United Kingdom, played a significant role in the events leading up to and during the early stages of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The UK held the Mandate for Palestine after World War I, responsible for administering the territory.  Their policies regarding Jewish immigration and land allocation deeply influenced the rising tensions between Jewish and Arab populations.  The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, expressed support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, a promise that directly impacted the conflict's trajectory.  Furthermore, the UK's actions and decisions during the Mandate period, such as restrictions on Jewish immigration and the partition plan, directly contributed to the escalation of conflict. While the UK's direct military involvement waned after the creation of Israel, their historical role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the region and their past policies are undeniably linked to the origins and development of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Therefore, England's involvement was not simply direct military action but a significant indirect influence.

Answer: {true}
"
1024,Is accountant a difficult profession for a person suffering from Dyscalculia?,"Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to understand numbers and perform mathematical calculations.  Accountancy is a profession that heavily relies on numerical skills, including calculations, financial analysis, and the interpretation of financial data.  Therefore, a person with dyscalculia would likely find many aspects of accountancy extremely challenging, if not impossible, to perform accurately and efficiently.  While some accommodations might be possible, the core requirements of the profession directly conflict with the difficulties presented by dyscalculia.

Answer: {false}
"
1027,Can printing books in kanji instead of the Roman alphabet save trees?,"Explanation:
Kanji characters are significantly more complex than Roman alphabet letters.  A single Kanji character often requires more ink and paper to print than a word or several words in the Roman alphabet. Therefore, printing a book in Kanji would likely use *more* paper and ink than printing the same content in the Roman alphabet.  This would lead to a greater consumption of resources, including trees, rather than saving them.

Answer: {false}
"
1028,Do the Egyptian pyramids look the same from outside as they did when new?,"The Egyptian pyramids have undergone significant changes since their construction.  Erosion from wind, sand, and rain has worn away stone, changing their appearance.  Human intervention, such as looting, restoration efforts, and the impact of modern development nearby, have also altered their look.  While the basic shapes remain, the level of detail and the overall condition are drastically different from their original state.

Answer: {false}
"
1029,Can you save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on Samsung Galaxy A10e?,"Here's an explanation of whether you can save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on a Samsung Galaxy A10e:

The Samsung Galaxy A10e has limited internal storage.  While the exact amount varies slightly depending on the model, it's generally around 32GB.  However, a significant portion of that storage is already used by the operating system and pre-installed apps.  

Each HD episode of Game of Thrones likely takes up several gigabytes of storage space.  With eight seasons and numerous episodes, the total storage required would far exceed the available space on the A10e's internal storage.  While you could potentially use a microSD card to expand storage, the total storage needed would still likely be beyond the capacity of most readily available and affordable microSD cards.

Therefore, it's highly improbable that you could store all HD episodes of Game of Thrones on a Samsung Galaxy A10e, even with a microSD card.

Answer: {false}
"
1030,Can Aerosmith legally drive in the carpool lane?,"To determine if Aerosmith can legally drive in the carpool lane, we need to know how many people are in the car.  Carpool lanes typically require a minimum number of occupants (usually two or more) to be eligible.  Since Aerosmith is a band with multiple members,  it's plausible that they could meet this requirement depending on who is in the vehicle.  However, we don't have that information and therefore cannot definitively say if they'd qualify.

Answer: {false}
"
1031,Can an ostrich fit into the nest of a swallow?,"Ostriches are very large birds, while swallows are very small birds.  An ostrich egg is significantly larger than a swallow.  An adult ostrich is far too large to fit into anything remotely resembling a swallow's nest.

Answer: {false}
"
1032,Can you house a giant squid at Soldier Field?,"Giant squid are massive cephalopods that can grow to lengths exceeding 40 feet.  Soldier Field, while a large stadium, is not designed to house marine life.  It lacks the necessary infrastructure such as a massive, specialized aquarium with a controlled environment to maintain the squid's survival – including temperature, salinity, water filtration, and the proper prey.  The squid would also need extremely large amounts of space and specialized handling techniques.  Therefore, it would be impossible to house a giant squid at Soldier Field.

Answer: {false}
"
1033,Would Constitution of the United States paper offend PETA?,"The Constitution of the United States is printed on paper, which is a product derived from trees.  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) advocates against animal cruelty and often protests practices that harm animals, including deforestation.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that PETA would object to the use of paper derived from trees, particularly if the trees were harvested unsustainably.

Answer: {true}
"
1034,Can a minotaur hypothetically injure a tibia playing football?,"A minotaur, being a mythical creature depicted as having the body of a man and the head of a bull, possesses legs capable of running and engaging in physical activities like football.  A tibia is a bone located in the lower leg.  Therefore, a minotaur, engaging in a football game, could theoretically suffer a tibia injury through tackling, being tackled, or other physical contact typical of the sport.

Answer: {true}
"
1035,If it socially acceptable to wear an icon depicting crucifixion?,"The social acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion is highly dependent on context and cultural norms.  In some cultures and religious contexts, particularly within Christianity, a crucifix is a common and respected symbol of faith and devotion.  Wearing a crucifix might be seen as a statement of religious identity or a personal expression of faith.  

However, in other contexts, particularly secular settings or in cultures with different religious traditions, wearing a crucifix could be perceived as insensitive, provocative, or even offensive. The size, style, and overall presentation of the icon also play a role.  A small, understated cross might be more acceptable than a large, graphic depiction of the crucifixion.  Furthermore, the wearer's intent and the reactions of those around them are crucial in determining social acceptability.

Therefore, there's no universally applicable answer.  The acceptability is highly situational.

Answer: {false}
"
1036,Was United Airlines blameless in worst crash in history?,"The worst crash in history is generally considered to be the Tenerife airport disaster in 1977, which involved two Boeing 747s.  United Airlines was not involved in this accident. The crash involved KLM and Pan Am aircraft. Therefore, United Airlines was blameless in this specific event.

Answer: {true}
"
1037,Did Clark Gable appear in any movies scored by John Williams?,"John Williams is a highly prolific and well-known film composer, but his career largely began in the 1960s and 1970s. Clark Gable's career as a leading man was predominantly in the 1930s and 1940s, with his death occurring in 1960.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that there would be any overlap in their careers where John Williams scored a film starring Clark Gable.  To confirm this would require a detailed examination of both their filmographies, but the chronological gap makes it improbable.

Answer: {false}
"
1038,Would Atlantic Salmon be within David Duchovny's dietary guidelines?,"David Duchovny is known to be a vegan.  Atlantic Salmon is a fish, and therefore not a vegan food.  Therefore, Atlantic Salmon would not be within David Duchovny's dietary guidelines.

Answer: {false}
"
1039,Can you purchase General Motors products at a movie theater?,"Movie theaters typically sell concessions like popcorn, candy, and drinks.  They do not typically sell automobiles.

Answer: {false}
"
1040,Is a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico likely to be safe from storms?,"The Gulf of Mexico is known for hurricane activity, particularly during the late summer and fall months, which includes the time frame of Halloween.  While a specific Halloween cruise might not encounter a storm, the risk is significantly higher than during other times of the year due to the hurricane season.  Therefore, it's unlikely that a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico would be completely safe from storms.

"
1041,Can Billie Eilish afford a Porsche?,"Billie Eilish is a very successful and popular singer.  She has earned a significant amount of money through album sales, streaming royalties, touring, and endorsements.  The cost of a Porsche varies greatly depending on the model, but even the most affordable models cost tens of thousands of dollars. Given Billie Eilish's considerable wealth and income, it is highly probable that she could afford to purchase a Porsche.

Answer: {true}
"
1042,Would a physician be unlikely to recommend Reiki?,"Answer: Reiki is a type of alternative medicine that involves channeling energy through touch to promote healing.  Physicians who practice conventional medicine are trained in evidence-based treatments and generally do not endorse or recommend alternative therapies like Reiki due to a lack of rigorous scientific evidence supporting its efficacy.  Therefore, a physician would be unlikely to recommend Reiki.

Answer: {true}
"
1043,Could common warthog be useful for scrimshaw?,"Scrimshaw is the art of carving and etching on bone, ivory, or tooth.  Warthogs have tusks, which are made of ivory.  Therefore, warthog tusks could potentially be used for scrimshaw.

"
1044,Would an American feel lost due to language barriers at Disneyland Paris?,"Disneyland Paris is located in France and the primary language spoken there is French.  While English is widely spoken in tourist areas, particularly at Disneyland Paris which caters to international visitors, an American might still encounter situations where French is predominantly used (signage, announcements, interactions with some staff).  The level of difficulty navigating the language barrier would vary from person to person, depending on their language skills.  While it's unlikely they'd feel *completely* lost, some level of difficulty is expected.

Answer: {true}
"
1045,Is it foolish to stand on giraffe's head to see over Eiffel Tower?,"The Eiffel Tower is approximately 1,063 feet tall.  Giraffes are around 14 to 19 feet tall.  Even if you were to stand on a giraffe's head, you would only gain a negligible height increase compared to the Eiffel Tower's height.  Therefore, standing on a giraffe's head would be incredibly dangerous, impractical, and ultimately futile for the purpose of seeing over the Eiffel Tower.  Furthermore, it is highly unethical and cruel to use a giraffe in this way.

Answer: {true}
"
1046,Could a Gladiator's weapon crush a diamond?,"The hardness of a diamond is rated at 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale, the highest ranking.  While a gladiator's weapon, such as a gladius or a trident, could be made of very strong materials like high-carbon steel, they wouldn't be nearly hard enough to scratch, let alone crush, a diamond.  The force required to crush a diamond would likely break the weapon itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1047,Is a curling iron necessary in curling?,"Curling is a sport played on ice using stones.  A curling iron is a heated styling tool used for hair.  Therefore, a curling iron is not necessary, or even relevant, in the sport of curling.

Answer: {false}
"
1048,Would someone on antidepressants need to be cautious of some citrus fruits?,"Answer: Some antidepressants, particularly those belonging to the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) class, can interact negatively with tyramine, a compound found in certain foods, including some citrus fruits.  This interaction can lead to a potentially dangerous increase in blood pressure.  While not all citrus fruits are high in tyramine, and the interaction is not always severe or inevitable, caution is advised for individuals taking MAOIs.  Other antidepressants are less likely to have this interaction.  Therefore, while it's not a universal precaution for all antidepressants, caution regarding some citrus fruits is warranted for those taking MAOIs.

Answer: {true}
"
1049,Has numerology helped shape hotel layouts?,"Numerology is the belief in the mystical significance of numbers.  While there's no widespread evidence that numerology directly dictated the layout of hotels, it's possible that some hotel designers or developers might have incorporated numerological principles *subjectively* into their designs. This would be more of a personal belief influencing design choices rather than a formal or widespread practice.  Many design choices are based on aesthetics, functionality, and feng shui, but there's no concrete evidence to suggest numerology is a major factor in the layout of hotels.

Answer: {false}
"
1050,Would Michael Phelps be good at pearl hunting?,"Michael Phelps is an incredibly accomplished swimmer, known for his exceptional lung capacity and underwater abilities.  Pearl hunting requires significant breath-holding capabilities and comfort in underwater environments. While not directly transferable skills, Phelps's swimming expertise suggests he would likely possess the physical attributes beneficial to pearl hunting.  He might require some training in the specific techniques, but his natural abilities give him a head start compared to the average person.

1051,Would someone pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros?,"Answer:  {True}

Explanation: While the US dollar is the primary currency used in New York City, many businesses, especially those in tourist areas, accept other major currencies like Euros to cater to international visitors.  Therefore, it's plausible someone could pay for a coffee with Euros in NYC, though it's not guaranteed all establishments would accept them.
"
1052,Is the tibia necessary to win the Stanley Cup?,"The tibia is a bone in the lower leg.

1059,Do giraffes require special facilities at zoos?,"Giraffes are large animals with specific needs regarding space, diet, and environmental conditions.  Zoos must provide extensive habitats to accommodate their size and natural behaviors, including sufficient space for movement and social interaction.  Their diet requires specialized plant materials, and their height necessitates taller structures and specialized feeding systems.  Maintaining appropriate temperature and humidity levels is also crucial. Therefore, zoos need to have special facilities to cater to these unique requirements.

1061,Did Leonardo da Vinci lack contemporary peers in his home city?,"Leonardo da Vinci was a remarkably talented and versatile individual, excelling in art, science, engineering, and more.  However, Florence during the High Renaissance was a hotbed of artistic and intellectual activity.  Other prominent artists such as Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Donatello were active contemporaries, albeit perhaps with different specialties.  While da Vinci's genius was undeniably exceptional, he certainly wasn't alone in his city's vibrant creative scene.  He had peers, though arguably none matched his breadth of talent.

1062,Do people take laxatives because they enjoy diarrhea?,"People do not take laxatives because they enjoy diarrhea.  Laxatives are used to relieve constipation, not to induce diarrhea for pleasure.  While some people might experience diarrhea as a side effect, the goal of taking a laxative is to promote bowel movements and alleviate discomfort caused by infrequent or difficult bowel movements.  The unpleasant side effects of diarrhea are generally not a desired outcome.

1063,Did Ice make people rich?,"The question asks whether Ice (presumably referring to the rapper Vanilla Ice) made people rich.  Vanilla Ice's song ""Ice Ice Baby"" was a massive hit, but whether it made *people* rich beyond himself is debatable. While he undoubtedly profited significantly, the success of the song doesn't directly translate to others becoming wealthy because of it.  There might be some associated industries that benefited (record labels, producers, etc.), but it's not a clear-cut case of widespread wealth creation for many individuals.

1066,Is Shakespeare famous because of the infinitive form?,"Shakespeare's fame is not due to his use of the infinitive form of verbs.  His fame rests on a multitude of factors, including his profound understanding of human nature, his masterful use of language (including a wide range of grammatical structures beyond just the infinitive), his creation of iconic characters and plots, and the enduring popularity and influence of his plays and sonnets across centuries and cultures.  While the infinitive is a grammatical element he used, it's not the defining characteristic of his work or the reason for his lasting legacy.

1072,Is being 5 year Capital One Venture member more cost effective than being in Church of Satan?,"The question compares the cost-effectiveness of two completely unrelated things: a Capital One Venture rewards credit card membership and membership in the Church of Satan.  There is no basis for comparison. The cost of a Capital One Venture card membership depends on spending habits and rewards utilization. The Church of Satan, while having dues, is primarily a philosophical organization, and its ""cost"" is not directly comparable to a financial product.  Therefore, no meaningful comparison can be made.

1076,Would a sofer be a bad job for a vegan?,"A sofer is a scribe who writes religious texts, particularly Torah scrolls, using a quill and ink.  The traditional inks used often contain ingredients derived from animals, such as gallnut ink (which may use animal glue as a binder).  While some modern alternatives exist, many traditional soferim (plural of sofer) still adhere to traditional methods.  Therefore, a vegan would likely find it difficult to reconcile their ethical beliefs with the traditional practices of a sofer.

1077,Is US route 1 dominated by historically red states?,"US Route 1 is a north-south route that runs along the East Coast of the United States.  It passes through many states, some traditionally considered ""red"" (Republican leaning) and some ""blue"" (Democrat leaning).  While a significant portion might pass through states that have historically voted Republican,  it's inaccurate to say it's *dominated* by them.  The route traverses a diverse range of states with varying political leanings.  Therefore, the statement is false.

1082,Are parodies of the President of the United States illegal?,"Answer: Parodies of the President of the United States are generally protected under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.  While there might be very narrow exceptions (e.g., if the parody directly incites violence),  the vast majority of satirical or comedic portrayals of the President would be considered legal.  The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right to parody public figures, even if those parodies are critical or unflattering.

Answer: {false}
"
1085,Did Paul the Apostle's cause of death violate the tenets of Ahimsa?,"Ahimsa, a principle central to many Indian religions like Jainism and Hinduism, advocates for non-violence towards all living beings.  Traditional accounts state that Paul the Apostle was beheaded in Rome.  While beheading is a violent act resulting in death, it's important to note that the concept of Ahimsa is interpreted differently across various faiths and philosophies.  Some interpretations focus solely on intentional harm, while others encompass a broader definition, including actions that indirectly lead to harm or suffering.  Whether Paul's execution violated Ahimsa depends entirely on the specific interpretation of the principle being applied.  There is no universally agreed-upon answer.  Therefore, while beheading is inherently violent and contradicts a strict interpretation of Ahimsa, the question is ultimately not definitively answerable without specifying which interpretation of Ahimsa is being considered.

Answer: {Inconclusive}

1091,Would a psychic who admits to hot reading be trustworthy?,"Answer: A psychic who admits to hot reading is not trustworthy.  Hot reading is a technique where a psychic gathers information about a client subtly through observation and conversation, then presents that information as psychic insight.  Since the information isn't actually psychic ability, but rather clever deduction, it lacks the integrity associated with genuine psychic ability.  Admitting to hot reading demonstrates that the psychic is not operating ethically and is, therefore, not trustworthy.

Answer: {false}
"
1092,Can Poland Spring make money in the Sahara?,"Poland Spring water is sourced from natural springs in Maine.  The Sahara Desert is an extremely arid region with minimal access to consistent water sources. Transporting large quantities of water across continents would be prohibitively expensive, and the lack of infrastructure in the Sahara would make distribution nearly impossible.  Therefore, Poland Spring would be unlikely to make money selling its water in the Sahara Desert.

1094,Would human race go extinct without chlorophyll?,"Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy.  This process is the foundation of most food chains on Earth. Without chlorophyll, plants would be unable to produce food, leading to a collapse of the ecosystem.  Herbivores would starve, followed by carnivores, and ultimately humans, who rely on plants either directly or indirectly for their food source.  Therefore, the extinction of the human race without chlorophyll is highly probable.

"
1097,Do suburbs encourage the use of cars?,"Suburban development is characterized by low population density, single-family homes, and a significant distance between homes and essential amenities like workplaces, schools, and grocery stores.  This spatial arrangement makes it difficult to rely on alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, or public transit.  The distances involved necessitate the use of personal vehicles for daily commutes, shopping, and other activities. The lack of walkable neighborhoods and inadequate public transportation systems in many suburbs actively encourages car dependency.

1100,Is Christopher Walken close to achieving EGOT status?,"To achieve EGOT status, a person must win an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award.  Let's examine Christopher Walken's awards:

* **Emmy:** He has won an Emmy Award.
* **Grammy:** He has not won a Grammy Award.
* **Oscar:** He has won an Oscar Award.
* **Tony:** He has won a Tony Award.

Since he is missing a Grammy, he is not close to achieving EGOT status.

"
1101,Can you substitute the pins in a bowling alley lane with Dustin Hoffman's Oscars?,"Explanation:

The question asks if Dustin Hoffman's Oscars could substitute the pins in a bowling alley lane.  This requires considering the size and number of bowling pins and the size and number of Dustin Hoffman's Oscars.

Bowling pins are relatively small and there are ten in a set.  Dustin Hoffman has won two Oscars.  Even if we were to assume his Oscars are unusually large, two objects are insufficient to replace ten.  Therefore, the substitution is not possible.

Answer: {false}
"
1102,Was Rumi's work serialized in a magazine?,"Rumi's works, primarily his poetry collected in the *Masnavi*, were not serialized in a magazine in the modern sense.  Magazines as we know them did not exist during Rumi's lifetime (1207-1273). His works were copied and circulated as manuscripts, and later compiled into larger collections. Therefore, the concept of serialization in a periodical doesn't apply to his writings.

Answer: {false}
"
1103,Would an astrologer focus on the densest terrestrial planet for a Friday horoscope?,"Astrologers focus on celestial bodies and their perceived influence on human affairs.  The densest terrestrial planet is Earth. While an astrologer might consider Earth's position and influence in a horoscope, the focus is generally on planets and other celestial bodies outside Earth, such as the Sun, Moon, and other planets.  A Friday horoscope would typically consider the positions of the planets in relation to the zodiac signs, not the density of the Earth. Therefore, the density of Earth is not a relevant factor in creating a horoscope.

Answer: {false}
"
1104,Can you see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf?,"Stonehenge is located in Wiltshire, England. Dusseldorf is a city in Germany.

1105,Did Brazilian jiu-jitsu Gracie founders have at least a baker's dozen of kids between them?,"The Gracie family, founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, is known for its large size.  While precise numbers vary depending on the source and definition of ""founder"" (considering the multiple generations involved), it's generally accepted that the family has produced significantly more than a baker's dozen (13) children across its generations involved in the development and spread of the martial art.  Therefore, it's highly probable that the combined number of children born to the founders exceeds 13.

"
1108,Do Apollo and Baldur share similar interests?,"Apollo, in Greek mythology, is associated with the sun, music, poetry, healing, and prophecy.  He is depicted as a god of light and reason, often involved in intellectual pursuits.

Baldur, in Norse mythology, is a god associated with light, beauty, purity, and joy. He is often portrayed as a gentle and beloved figure.

While both gods share some thematic similarities—light and beauty are common to both—their spheres of influence differ significantly. Apollo is more focused on intellectual and artistic pursuits, while Baldur's attributes point more toward benevolent influence and positive energy.  They do not share specific common interests in terms of activities or domains of power.

Answer: {false}
"
1109,Is it wise to feed a Snickers bar to a poodle?,"Explanation: Chocolate is toxic to dogs, including poodles.  Snickers bars contain chocolate, and feeding a Snickers bar to a poodle could make the dog sick, potentially seriously.  The amount of chocolate in a Snickers bar and the size of the poodle would determine the severity of the reaction, but it's best to avoid the risk entirely.

Answer: {false}
"
1110,Would an Olympic athlete be tired out after running a mile?,"Answer: Olympic athletes are highly trained and have exceptional cardiovascular fitness. While running a mile is a significant distance, it's well within the capabilities of an Olympic-level runner, and they wouldn't necessarily be ""tired out"" in the sense of being completely exhausted.  They might be somewhat fatigued, but not necessarily extremely tired.  It depends on the athlete's specific event and their training.  A marathon runner, for example, would be much less fatigued after a mile than a sprinter.

Answer: {false}
"
1111,Would a Catholic priest commend someone's pride?,"Catholic teaching emphasizes humility and views pride as a sin (one of the seven deadly sins).  Therefore, a Catholic priest would be unlikely to commend someone's pride.

Answer: {false}
"
1112,Could white rice go rancid before sesame seeds?,"White rice, especially if stored improperly, can go rancid relatively quickly due to its high starch content.  Starch is susceptible to oxidation and enzymatic reactions, leading to off-flavors and spoilage. Sesame seeds, on the other hand, contain oils that have a longer shelf life, although they can eventually become rancid as well.  Therefore, under typical storage conditions, white rice is more likely to spoil before sesame seeds.

Answer: {true}
"

"
1115,Would ISIS agree with Al-Farabi's religious sect?,"Al-Farabi was a Muslim philosopher who advocated for a religiously tolerant society governed by reason and justice.  His political philosophy emphasized the importance of a virtuous ruler and a well-ordered state, concepts that are largely incompatible with the extreme and violent ideology of ISIS. ISIS, on the other hand, promotes a radical interpretation of Islam, justifying violence and terrorism to achieve its goals.  Their views on religious tolerance, governance, and the use of force are diametrically opposed to Al-Farabi's. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that ISIS would agree with Al-Farabi's religious sect or political philosophy.

Answer: {false}
"
1116,Do mollymawks live where albatrosses cannot?,"Mollymawks are a type of albatross.  Therefore, they live in the same places albatrosses live.  Albatrosses cannot live where albatrosses cannot live; this is tautological.  Therefore, mollymawks cannot live where albatrosses cannot live either.

Answer: {false}
"
1117,Is a spice grinder ueseless for the cheapest cinnamon sticks?,"Explanation: Cheap cinnamon sticks are often thicker and harder than higher-quality sticks.  A spice grinder is designed to pulverize spices, and while it might be able to handle some of the cheaper cinnamon, it might struggle with the hard, thick pieces.  It could potentially jam or break the grinder.  Therefore, while not entirely useless, a spice grinder might be inefficient and prone to problems when used with the cheapest, thickest cinnamon sticks. A mortar and pestle would be a more suitable tool for this task.

Answer: {false}
"
1118,Would Carolina Reaper decrease sales if added to all US salsa?,"The Carolina Reaper is one of the hottest chili peppers in the world.  Adding it to all US salsa would drastically alter the flavor profile, making it unpalatable to a significant portion of the population who prefer milder salsas. This would likely lead to a decrease in overall salsa sales, as many consumers would switch to other condiments or brands offering less spicy options.  While some consumers might appreciate the extreme heat, the vast majority would likely be turned off.

Answer: {true}
"
1119,Are any of the destinations of Japan Airlines former Axis Powers?,"Japan Airlines is a Japanese airline.  During World War II, Japan was a member of the Axis powers.  Therefore, any destination served by Japan Airlines could potentially be a former Axis power.  To be certain we need to know if Japan Airlines flies to Germany or Italy (other than Japan itself).  While it's highly probable given the global nature of air travel, it's not guaranteed without verifying specific flight routes.  However, considering Japan's history and the interconnectedness of global air travel, it's more likely than not that some of Japan Airlines' destinations are former Axis powers.

Answer: {true}
"
1120,Do some people soak in olive oil and water?,"Some people believe that soaking in a bath with olive oil and water can provide various health benefits, such as moisturizing the skin.  However, there's no scientific evidence to support these claims. While olive oil is known for its moisturizing properties when applied topically, there's no reason to believe it would be significantly more effective when added to bathwater. In fact, it could create a slippery and potentially hazardous bathing environment.  Therefore, while some people may choose to do this, it's not a common practice and lacks scientific backing.

Answer: {false}
"
1121,Could a nymph tick pass through a standard hole punch?,"A standard hole punch creates a hole roughly 6mm in diameter.  Nymph ticks are very small, but their size varies depending on the species and their life stage.  While some nymph ticks might be small enough to fit through a 6mm hole, it's not guaranteed that *all* nymph ticks would be able to.  Therefore, it's not definitively true that a nymph tick could pass through a standard hole punch.

Answer: {false}
"

Answer: {false}
"
1125,Does Osama bin Laden put a wafer on his tongue every Sunday?,"Osama bin Laden was a devout Muslim.  While specific details of his religious practices are not publicly known, it's highly unlikely he would have participated in a Christian communion ritual which involves consuming a wafer on Sunday.  The act of consuming a wafer is central to Christian religious practice, not Islamic practice.

Answer: {false}
"
1126,Could modern Brazilian Navy have hypothetically turned the tide in Battle of Actium?,"The Battle of Actium (31 BC) was a naval battle fought between Octavian's forces and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.  To assess whether the modern Brazilian Navy could have changed the outcome, we need to consider several factors:

* **Technological Disparity:** The modern Brazilian Navy possesses significantly superior technology compared to the ancient Roman fleets. This includes faster and more maneuverable ships, superior weaponry (missiles, cannons), and advanced communication systems.  The Roman ships relied on ramming, grappling, and boarding tactics.  The difference is massive.

* **Scale of the Battle:** The Battle of Actium involved a large number of ships, though the exact figures are debated.  The modern Brazilian Navy is not exceptionally large, and its fleet wouldn't be able to replicate a scale of that magnitude on its own. However, even a fraction of its modern firepower could have inflicted devastating damage.

* **Tactical Doctrine:**  Modern naval warfare tactics are completely different from those of the ancient world. The use of ranged weaponry, precision strikes, and air support would have radically altered the battle's dynamics.

* **Logistics and Deployment:** Transporting a modern navy to Actium in 31 BC would be impossible; this is a factor completely outside the scope of naval capability.

Considering the overwhelming technological advantage of the modern Brazilian Navy, even a small portion of its capabilities deployed at Actium would almost certainly have been able to inflict crippling losses on either fleet involved.  The outcome would almost certainly have been different, even if the complete force of the Brazilian Navy couldn't have been transported to the area.

1127,Could Plato have agreed with the beliefs of Jainism?,"Plato's philosophy, particularly his Theory of Forms, emphasizes the existence of a perfect, eternal realm of ideal forms, which are the true objects of knowledge.  The physical world is merely a shadow or imitation of this perfect realm.  Jainism, on the other hand, focuses on the liberation of the soul (jiva) from the cycle of rebirth through non-violence (ahimsa), self-discipline, and the renunciation of worldly attachments. While both philosophies emphasize a quest for knowledge and liberation from suffering, their approaches differ significantly.

Plato's focus is on intellectual understanding of the Forms, while Jainism emphasizes practical conduct and ethical living as the path to liberation.  Furthermore, while Plato's theory of Forms suggests a dualistic view between the physical and ideal worlds, Jainism's cosmology is more complex, involving multiple realms of existence and a cycle of reincarnation driven by karma.  There is no clear equivalent in Jainism to Plato's concept of the Forms.  Although both seek a kind of enlightenment or release from suffering, the means and the ultimate goal are distinct enough to suggest significant disagreement.  While some common ground might exist regarding the importance of self-knowledge and striving for a better state of being, it's unlikely Plato would completely agree with the core tenets and practices of Jainism.

1129,"Did the Gunpowder plot eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots bloodline?","The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 aimed to assassinate King James I and his government, not Mary, Queen of Scots.  Mary had already been executed in 1587.  While the plotters may have had broader grievances against the Stuart monarchy, the plot itself didn't directly target Mary's bloodline.  Her descendants continued to exist and were not eliminated by the events of the Gunpowder Plot.

1132,Can Spartina Patens thrive in the Sahara Desert?,"Spartina patens, commonly known as saltmarsh cordgrass, is a plant species adapted to coastal salt marshes.  These environments are characterized by high salinity, high moisture content, and specific soil conditions. The Sahara Desert, on the other hand, is characterized by extremely low rainfall, high temperatures, and arid conditions.  The drastically different environmental conditions—the lack of water and the extreme heat—would make it impossible for Spartina patens to survive and thrive in the Sahara Desert.

1134,Do beeswax alternatives to cling wrap use plsatic?,"Many beeswax food wraps are made using natural materials like beeswax, jojoba oil, and tree resin.  However, some commercially produced alternatives might incorporate plastic or plastic-based polymers to improve durability, flexibility, or reduce cost. While some brands explicitly market themselves as plastic-free, it's crucial to check the specific product's ingredients and manufacturing processes to determine if it contains any plastic components.  It's not a universal ""yes"" or ""no.""

Answer: {It depends on the specific product.}
"
1135,Would it be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei?,"Kami Rita Sherpa is a Nepalese mountaineer who holds the record for the most successful ascents of Mount Everest.  Mount Emei is a mountain in China, significantly lower in altitude than Everest and known for its Buddhist temples and scenic beauty, rather than extreme technical climbing challenges.  While Mount Emei involves some steep sections and requires a reasonable level of fitness, it's not comparable in difficulty to Everest's extreme altitude, icefalls, and treacherous terrain.  Therefore, it would be relatively easy for a seasoned mountaineer like Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei.

"
1138,Would an expensive tailor use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks?,"High-end tailors prioritize the preservation of the garment's quality and integrity.  Using adhesive to shorten a hem is generally considered a less-than-ideal method because it can damage the fabric, leave a visible residue, and not provide a durable or professional finish. A skilled tailor would use a more traditional method like hand-stitching or machine-stitching to create a clean, even, and long-lasting hem.  Therefore, it's unlikely an expensive tailor would resort to adhesive.

Answer: {false}
"
1139,Do frogs feel disgust?,"Answer: {False}

Explanation: While research on animal emotions is ongoing and complex, there's currently no scientific consensus that frogs experience disgust in the same way humans do.  Disgust is a complex emotion often tied to learned aversions and social contexts, factors not readily observed in amphibian behavior.  Frogs might exhibit avoidance behaviors in response to unpleasant stimuli (like a bad taste), but this is a basic survival response rather than the nuanced emotional experience of disgust.
"
1140,Is clerk of Supreme Court of Canada safe profession for someone with seismophobia?,"Seismophobia is the fear of earthquakes.  The Supreme Court of Canada is located in Ottawa, Canada, which is in a zone with a moderate risk of earthquakes. While the risk is not exceptionally high, there is still a possibility of experiencing an earthquake.  The building itself is likely constructed to withstand seismic activity to a certain degree. However, the job of a clerk is not inherently safer from earthquake impacts than other jobs in the same area. A clerk in the building could experience anxiety during an earthquake. Therefore, a clerk of the Supreme Court of Canada is not a safe profession for someone with seismophobia.

1143,Could Al Capone have read works from the Harlem Renaissance?,"Al Capone's criminal career spanned the 1920s and 1930s.  The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural movement that flourished in the 1920s and 1930s, primarily in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City.  While there's no direct evidence that Al Capone read specific works from the Harlem Renaissance, it's highly probable he had access to them.  The Harlem Renaissance produced widely popular literature, music, and art, and given Capone's wealth and influence, it's reasonable to assume he could have encountered these works through various means. He wouldn't necessarily have appreciated or understood the nuances of the movement, but access is very likely.

"
1144,Was latest Republican governor of New Jersey as of 2020 heftiest politician ever?,"The question asks whether the latest Republican governor of New Jersey as of 2020 was the heftiest politician ever.  This requires determining who the governor was and then researching their weight and comparing it to other politicians throughout history.  This is difficult to answer definitively. While we can find the weight of recent politicians, it's impractical to compile and compare the weights of all politicians across all of history.  Finding reliable weight information for historical figures would be nearly impossible. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether a specific governor was the ""heaviest politician ever.""

"
1152,Is narcissism's origin a rare place to get modern words from?,"The word ""narcissism"" originates from Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Narcissus.  While Greek mythology is a historical source, it's not a *modern* source in the sense of contemporary language creation.  Modern English words are typically derived from more recent sources like scientific advancements, technological innovations, or cultural shifts.  Therefore, while ""narcissism"" is a modern word with a modern meaning, its etymological origin is ancient and not considered a typical or ""rare"" place for modern word derivation in the general sense.

Answer: {false}
"
1153,Is art prioritized in the US education system?,"The US education system's prioritization of art is complex and varies significantly depending on factors like school district funding, state standards, and individual school policies.  While the arts are often included in curricula, especially at younger grade levels, their emphasis often takes a backseat to core subjects like math, science, and reading, particularly as students progress through higher grades.  Budget cuts frequently target arts programs first, resulting in reduced class time, fewer resources, and even program elimination.  This uneven distribution across schools and grade levels indicates a lack of consistent, high-level prioritization of arts education nationwide.  Therefore, while art is present in many US schools, it's not consistently prioritized at a national level.

"
1159,Did Johnny Carson win enough Emmy's to fill a carton if Emmy's were eggs?,"Here's an explanation to determine if Johnny Carson won enough Emmys to fill a carton of eggs:

First, we need to determine how many Emmys Johnny Carson won.  A quick search reveals he won numerous Emmys throughout his career, but the exact number isn't immediately clear and varies depending on the source and what is considered a ""win"" (e.g., individual awards versus those shared with the whole production team).  Let's assume, for the sake of this exercise, that he won a relatively large number, say 20.

Next, we need to determine how many eggs a standard carton holds. A typical carton holds 12 eggs.

Finally, we compare the number of Emmys won to the number of eggs in a carton. 20 Emmys are far more than 12 eggs.

Therefore, even with a conservative estimate of his Emmy wins, the answer is yes, he would have won enough Emmys to fill a carton of eggs if they were sized similarly.

Answer: {true}
"
1160,Did Julius Caesar read books on Pharmacology?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation: While Julius Caesar was a highly educated and influential figure in Roman history, there's no historical evidence to suggest he had any interest in or knowledge of pharmacology as a scientific discipline.  Pharmacology as a formalized field of study developed much later.  Any knowledge of medicinal herbs or treatments would have been based on traditional practices, not the systematic study of drugs and their effects that characterizes modern pharmacology.

"
1163,Is the cuisine of Hawaii suitable for a vegan?,"Hawaiian cuisine traditionally incorporates a lot of seafood and meat, but also features many plant-based ingredients.  Dishes often include poi (made from taro root), various fruits and vegetables, and coconut milk.  While many traditional dishes are not vegan, it's entirely possible to find and create vegan-friendly meals in Hawaii by focusing on the plant-based components and avoiding meat and seafood.  Many restaurants are now also catering to vegan diets.

Answer: {true}
"
1164,Has Ringo Starr been in a relatively large number of bands?,"Ringo Starr is primarily known for his role as the drummer for the Beatles, one of the most famous and influential bands in history.  While he has participated in other musical projects and collaborations throughout his career,  the Beatles represent the overwhelming majority of his significant band experience.  Therefore, while he's been in more than one band, the number is relatively small compared to musicians who have actively pursued a career spanning multiple bands throughout their lives.

Answer: {false}
"
1165,Would Achilles dominate Legolas in a hypothetical fight?,"Achilles, a legendary Greek warrior renowned for his nearly impenetrable armor and unmatched fighting prowess, would likely dominate Legolas, a skilled elf archer from Middle-earth.  While Legolas is incredibly agile, a master archer, and possesses supernatural elven reflexes, Achilles's superior strength, combat experience, and virtually invulnerable body (save for his heel) would give him a significant advantage in a direct confrontation.  Legolas's ranged attacks would be less effective against a warrior as powerful and durable as Achilles, and Achilles's superior close-quarters combat skills would likely overwhelm Legolas in a hand-to-hand encounter.  Therefore, Achilles is far more likely to win this hypothetical fight.

Answer: {true}
"
1166,Would someone on a keto diet be able to eat Dosa?,"Dosa is a South Indian pancake made primarily from fermented rice and lentil batter.  The batter contains carbohydrates, which are restricted on a ketogenic diet.  While dosa may contain some fats, the carbohydrate content significantly outweighs the fat, making it unsuitable for a keto diet.

Answer: {false}
"
1167,Did Metallica band members cutting their hair hurt their sales?,"Metallica's image is strongly tied to their long hair.  A significant shift in their appearance, such as cutting their hair, could be perceived as a change in their brand identity.  While it's difficult to definitively say it *hurt* their sales, it's plausible that a drastic change in image could alienate some fans and potentially impact album sales or concert attendance.  However, other factors (musical direction changes, changing musical tastes, etc.)  would have also influenced their sales. Therefore, a direct causal link between them cutting their hair and a drop in sales is difficult to establish conclusively.

Answer: {false}
"
1168,Would Quiet from Metal Gear be a poor hypothetical choice for lecturer at Haub?,"Quiet, from Metal Gear Solid V, is a highly skilled soldier with a unique and arguably traumatic past.  However, her expertise lies in stealth, infiltration, and combat, not in lecturing or academic fields relevant to Haub School of Business (assuming this refers to a business school). Her personality is also characterized by stoicism and a lack of overt communication, traits that wouldn't be conducive to effective teaching. Therefore, she would be a poor choice for a lecturer at a business school.

Answer: {true}
"
1169,Can a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 hypothetically lift Mount Emei?,"The Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 is a powerful crane, but it's not powerful enough to lift Mount Emei.  Mount Emei is a massive mountain with an estimated volume of billions of cubic meters of rock. Even if we could somehow get a hook under the entire mountain, the crane's lifting capacity, even at its maximum, is far, far smaller than the weight of such a massive mountain. The crane's lifting capacity is measured in tons, while the weight of Mount Emei would be measured in billions of tons.  Therefore, the crane's capacity is many orders of magnitude too small to lift the mountain.

Answer: {false}
"
1170,Is snoring a sign of good breathing while sleeping?,"Snoring is caused by vibrations in the soft tissues of the throat during sleep.  These vibrations occur when airflow is partially obstructed, often due to relaxed throat muscles or other anatomical issues.  Good breathing while sleeping is characterized by smooth, quiet airflow.  Therefore, snoring indicates a *problem* with breathing, not good breathing.

Answer: {false}
"
1171,Is calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles a preposterous claim?,"Answer: ABBA was a hugely successful Swedish pop group, achieving international fame and sales comparable to The Beatles.  While not directly comparable in musical style, the comparison highlights their massive cultural impact and widespread popularity.  Calling them ""the Swedish Beatles"" is a hyperbolic simplification but not entirely preposterous, as it captures their immense success and influence within their respective contexts.  It's a catchy descriptor, but it risks oversimplifying the unique qualities of both bands.

Answer: {false}

"
1173,Is Dungeons and Dragons a game well suited for solo play?,"Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a role-playing game traditionally played with a group.  However,  the design has evolved, and several resources and rule variations exist explicitly for solo play.  These resources often include pre-generated adventures designed specifically for one player,  rules modifications to handle challenges and encounters designed for multiple players, and tools to manage different aspects of the game independently. While the collaborative storytelling aspect is diminished in solo play, many players find it a satisfying way to experience the game system.  Therefore, D&D can be adapted for and enjoyed in solo play.

Answer: {true}

"
1175,Were all of Heracles's children present for his funeral pyre?,"Heracles had many children, with different mothers, across various locations.  It's highly improbable that all of them would have been able to attend his funeral pyre, considering the travel limitations and lack of centralized communication in ancient Greece.  Some children might have been too young, or too far away to make the journey in time.

Answer: {false}
"
1176,Could the moon fit inside the Black Sea?,"The Black Sea has a maximum depth of approximately 2,212 meters (7,257 feet).  The moon's diameter is approximately 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles), or 3,474,000 meters.  Since the moon's diameter is significantly larger than the Black Sea's maximum depth, the moon could not fit inside the Black Sea.

Answer: {false}
"
1177,Will you see peach blossoms and Andromeda at the same time?,"Peach blossoms bloom in the spring, typically from March to May in the Northern Hemisphere, depending on the variety and climate.  Andromeda (the constellation) is visible in the night sky year-round from certain locations on Earth, but its prominence varies with the time of year.  Because they are observed in completely different ways (one a flowering plant and one a group of stars), and their peak visibility/blooming times don't overlap, you cannot see them simultaneously.

Answer: {false}
"
1178,Will Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley score same amount of Bacon Number points?,"Bacon number measures an actor's distance from Kevin Bacon in the ""six degrees of separation"" game.  To have the same Bacon number, Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley would need to have collaborated with the same actors to form a chain connecting them both to Kevin Bacon in the same number of steps.  While they've both acted extensively, there's no guarantee their collaborative networks overlap enough to achieve this. The probability is low that they will have the same Bacon number.


Answer: {false}
"
1179,Was the tenth Amendment to the Constitution written using Pitman shorthand?,"The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was written and ratified well before Pitman shorthand was commonly used.  Pitman shorthand gained popularity in the mid-19th century, while the Tenth Amendment was ratified in 1791.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that it was written using Pitman shorthand.

Answer: {false}
"
1180,Did Ivan the Terrible's father and grandfather have nicer nicknames?,"Ivan the Terrible's father was Vasily III, and his grandfather was Ivan III.  While ""Terrible"" is a translation that carries negative connotations, neither Vasily III nor Ivan III had nicknames with the same level of negative popular association.  Ivan III is sometimes referred to as ""Ivan the Great"" which is a positive descriptor, while Vasily III didn't have a widely known, memorable nickname.  Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that their nicknames, or lack thereof in the case of Vasily III, were less negative than Ivan the Terrible's.

1187,Can you find Depala's race in World of Warcraft?,"Depala is a character in World of Warcraft.  Determining her race requires looking at in-game information and lore.  While there isn't a single definitive statement explicitly stating her race in the way that might be found for major characters, analyzing her appearance and location can help determine the most likely possibility.  This often involves cross-referencing information from various sources, such as the game's official website, the WoW Wiki, or community discussions.

Answer: {Undetermined}
"
1188,Are twins always born during the same year?,"Twins are typically born during the same year, however, there's a very small possibility that they could be born in different years.  This would occur if one twin were born very late in the year (e.g., December 31st) and the other very early in the following year (e.g., January 1st).  While extremely rare, it is not impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
1191,Would a kaffir lime be a good ingredient for making a candle?,"Kaffir lime leaves are known for their strong, citrusy aroma.  This fragrance would be quite pleasant in a candle.  The leaves themselves, however, are not typically used directly in candle-making due to their texture and potential for uneven burning.  Instead, the essential oil extracted from kaffir lime leaves is a popular choice for adding fragrance to candles.  Therefore, while the kaffir lime itself isn't directly used, its essential oil makes it a suitable ingredient.

Answer: {true}
"
1192,Would it be possible to fit a football field in Alcatraz Island?,"Alcatraz Island is relatively small.  A standard American football field is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide.  While precise dimensions of Alcatraz Island aren't readily available in a single, easily accessible source, visual inspection of maps and satellite imagery suggests it's considerably smaller than the area a football field would require.  There simply isn't enough space to accommodate a football field on Alcatraz Island.

Answer: {false}
"
1193,Can you hunt Iberian wolves in the Southern United States?,"Iberian wolves are native to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).  They are not found in the Southern United States. Therefore, hunting them there would be impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
1194,Would a spider wasp be more effective than a bullet ant to stop a criminal?,"The question asks whether a spider wasp would be more effective than a bullet ant to stop a criminal.  Effectiveness in this context implies incapacitation or deterrence.  Both spider wasps and bullet ants inflict extremely painful stings. However, the level of pain and the resulting incapacitation differ.  Bullet ants are known for their exceptionally painful sting, often described as the most painful insect sting.  This intense pain could temporarily incapacitate a criminal.  Spider wasps, while also having a painful sting, are not known for the same level of immediate, debilitating pain as bullet ants.  While the venom could potentially have some paralytic effect, it is unlikely to be as effective for immediate incapacitation as the bullet ant's sting.  Therefore, a bullet ant sting is likely to be more effective in stopping a criminal due to its greater pain and immediate incapacitating effect.


Answer: {false}
"
1195,Did Disney's second film rip off a prophet story?,"Disney's second film, *Pinocchio*, draws heavily from the story of Pinocchio as told in Carlo Collodi's children's novel, *The Adventures of Pinocchio*.  While Collodi's work doesn't explicitly cite a specific prophet, the themes of morality, temptation, and divine intervention present in *Pinocchio* are common motifs in prophetic narratives across various religions.  The puppet's journey towards becoming a real boy, guided by conscience and facing consequences for his actions, aligns with the archetypal prophetic narrative of spiritual growth and transformation.  However, it's crucial to distinguish between ""ripping off"" and drawing inspiration from established literary archetypes.  *Pinocchio* adapts and modifies the source material, adding Disney's own unique style and characterizations, but the core narrative structure shares strong similarities with the broader framework of a morality tale, a structure that has been employed by countless prophets and religious figures throughout history to convey ethical and spiritual messages.  Therefore, while there's no direct ""rip-off"" of a specific prophet's story, the film's narrative structure draws parallels with the common tropes found within many prophetic narratives.

1197,Could $1 for each 2009 eclipse buy a copy of TIME magazine in 2020?,"Explanation:

To answer this question, we need to consider the following:

1. **Number of 2009 eclipses:**  There were several solar and lunar eclipses in 2009.  However, the specific number isn't crucial as long as there was at least one.
2. **Cost of TIME magazine in 2020:** This would vary depending on where it's purchased and the edition. However, a reasonable estimate would be $5 or more.
3. **Total money from eclipses:**  Even if we assume only one dollar per eclipse, and several eclipses occurred in 2009, the total amount of money would be significantly more than one dollar. This money, if saved, would easily cover the cost of a TIME magazine in 2020.

1199,Can oysters be preserved without refrigeration?,"Oysters are highly perishable and require refrigeration to prevent spoilage due to the rapid growth of bacteria.  Traditional preservation methods like canning or smoking require specific processing to kill bacteria and prevent spoilage, and these methods are not typically employed for home preservation.  Therefore, without refrigeration, oysters would spoil quickly and become unsafe to consume.

"
1202,"During the Cuban revolution, did the US experience a population boom?","The Cuban Revolution (1953-1959) did not cause a population boom in the United States.  While the revolution led to a significant exodus of Cubans to the US, this influx of immigrants would not constitute a ""boom"" in the overall US population.  A population boom implies a substantial increase in the birth rate or a significant net increase of the population over a short period, driven by factors such as economic prosperity or increased fertility rates. The arrival of Cuban refugees, while substantial, was not the primary driver of population growth in the US during that period.  Other factors would have far greater influence on overall US population growth during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Answer: {false}
"
1203,Is tobacco use made to seem enjoyable in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland does not explicitly depict tobacco use as enjoyable. While there are references to smoking (such as the hookah-smoking caterpillar), these instances are presented in a whimsical and often absurd context, not as endorsements of the habit.  The overall tone surrounding smoking in the story is more one of strangeness and incongruity rather than appealing or pleasurable.  Therefore, it's not accurate to say tobacco use is portrayed as enjoyable.

Answer: {false}
"
1204,Can eating grapefruit kill besides allergies or choking?,"Grapefruit interacts with a number of medications, primarily by affecting the enzymes in the liver that metabolize drugs. This can lead to either an increase or decrease in the drug's effectiveness, potentially causing serious side effects or even toxicity.  The increased concentration of certain drugs can be lethal, even without an allergy or choking hazard. While not directly causing death in itself, grapefruit's effect on drug metabolism poses a significant risk of death when combined with certain medications.

Answer: {true}
"
1205,Was Kane (wrestler) banned from WCW  headquarters city?,"Kane, a professional wrestler, is known for his career primarily in WWE, not WCW.  While he may have had interactions with WCW wrestlers or appeared in events that crossed over, there's no record or indication he was ever banned from a WCW headquarters city.  WCW's headquarters were primarily located in Atlanta, Georgia. Therefore, a ban in Atlanta related specifically to his status as a WWE wrestler would be unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
1206,Is an ammonia fighting cleaner good for pet owners?,"Ammonia is toxic to pets.  Ammonia-fighting cleaners may contain residual ammonia or release ammonia fumes as they clean, posing a risk to pets who may ingest the cleaner, inhale the fumes, or even have skin contact.  Therefore, ammonia-fighting cleaners are generally not considered good for pet owners.  Safer alternatives exist that use pet-friendly ingredients.

Answer: {false}

1207,Would a packed Wembley stadium be likely to have a descendant of the Mongols inside?,"Wembley Stadium has a capacity exceeding 90,000 people.  The Mongol Empire's vast reach and influence extended across a significant portion of Eurasia.  Given the global population and the significant passage of time, it is highly probable that there would be descendants of the Mongols among a large and diverse crowd such as that found at a packed Wembley Stadium.  The chances are very high.

1208,Did Holy Saturday 2019 have special significance to pot smokers?,"Holy Saturday is the day before Easter Sunday.  In 2019, April 20th (4/20) fell on a Saturday.  4/20 is a significant date for marijuana users. Therefore, Holy Saturday 2019 held special significance for some pot smokers due to the coinciding dates.

1210,Did Brad Peyton need to know about seismology?,"Brad Peyton is a film director known for directing disaster movies, most notably the 2015 film ""San Andreas.""  This film heavily features earthquakes and their effects.  A realistic depiction of earthquakes and their impact would require a significant understanding of seismology, the scientific study of earthquakes and seismic waves. While Peyton might not need to be an expert seismologist, having a working knowledge of the subject would be crucial for the accuracy and believability of his film.  Consultants with expertise in seismology are commonly used in such productions.

Answer: {true}
"
1211,Would an average American Public University be welcoming to Ku Klux Klan members?,"The Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist hate group that espouses racist, antisemitic, and anti-immigrant views.  Public universities in the United States are generally committed to principles of diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity.  While universities uphold freedom of speech, the hateful ideology of the KKK is fundamentally incompatible with these values.  The presence of KKK members would likely be met with significant opposition from students, faculty, and the university administration. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that an average American public university would be welcoming to KKK members.

1216,Would a Fakir be surprised if they saw a comma in their religious book?,"Fakirs are typically associated with religious traditions (like Hinduism or Sufism) where sacred texts are often written without punctuation, including commas.  The use of commas is a feature of modern Western writing conventions, not traditionally found in many ancient or classical religious texts. Therefore, a Fakir would likely be surprised to see a comma in their religious book.

"
1218,Is Kobe's famous animal product used in a BLT?,"Kobe beef is a type of wagyu beef known for its marbling and tenderness.  A BLT sandwich traditionally contains bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  Bacon is cured pork, not beef. Therefore, Kobe beef is not used in a BLT.

Answer: {false}
"
1219,Could a camel fit in a dog house?,"Answer: Camels are very large animals, significantly larger than even the biggest dog houses.  A dog house is designed to accommodate a dog, and even the largest dog breeds are much smaller than a camel. Therefore, a camel would not fit in a dog house.
Answer: {false}
"
1220,Do skeletons have hair?,"Skeletons are the bony frameworks of vertebrates.  While a skeleton might retain some remnants of hair or other soft tissues during the early stages of decomposition, the process of decomposition eventually breaks down these soft tissues.  Therefore, a fully formed skeleton, as typically understood, would not have hair.

Answer: {false}
"
1221,Is there a warthog on Broadway?,"The question asks if there is a warthog on Broadway.  To answer this, we need to consider if there are any Broadway shows currently featuring warthogs as characters or elements of the set design.  There is no readily available, easily accessible database of every prop and animal used in every Broadway show at any given time.  A thorough investigation would require reviewing materials from every current Broadway production, which is impractical.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not a warthog is currently on Broadway.  The most likely answer is no, as warthogs are not common theatrical animals.

Answer: {false}
"
1222,Would the Ku Klux Klan welcome Opal Tometi into their group?,"The Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist hate group with a history of violence and terrorism against Black Americans and other minority groups.  Opal Tometi is a Nigerian-American activist and one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement.  Given the Klan's racist ideology and Tometi's activism against racial injustice, it is highly improbable that the Ku Klux Klan would welcome her into their group.  In fact, they would likely see her as an enemy.

1223,Is a cory catfish likely to eat another living fish?,"Corydoras catfish are generally peaceful, bottom-dwelling fish that primarily feed on insects, worms, and other small invertebrates. While they might occasionally nibble at the fins or scales of a slower-moving or injured fish, they are not typically known to actively hunt and eat other fish, especially larger ones.  Their mouths and feeding habits are not suited for predatory behavior towards other fish.

"
1225,Would an Orthodox Presbyterian object to 1700s judge's attire?,"Answer: Orthodox Presbyterians generally adhere to a conservative and traditional interpretation of Christianity.  1700s judicial attire, often featuring elaborate wigs and robes, might be considered ostentatious or excessively formal by some Orthodox Presbyterians who value simplicity and humility in dress.  While not a definitive rejection,  the emphasis on avoiding outward displays of wealth or status in their religious beliefs might lead some to disapprove of such attire.  Therefore, it is possible, though not guaranteed, an Orthodox Presbyterian would object.

Answer: {true}
"
1226,Can you buy furniture and meatballs in the same store?,"The question asks if it's possible to buy furniture and meatballs in the same store.  This depends on the type of store.  Some large furniture stores may have cafes or restaurants that serve food, including meatballs.  However, most furniture stores do not sell prepared foods, and most stores that sell prepared foods (such as grocery stores or restaurants) do not sell furniture.  Therefore, while it's *possible* in some rare cases, it's generally not the norm.

Answer: {false}
"
1231,Would a Common warthog starve in a greenhouse?,"A greenhouse, while providing shelter and potentially some plant matter, would not offer a sufficient and sustainable food source for a common warthog.  Warthogs primarily consume grasses, roots, bulbs, insects, and other invertebrates. While a greenhouse might have some plants, these are likely to be cultivated plants not naturally suitable for a warthog's diet and in insufficient quantity.  The lack of access to the warthog's natural food sources would lead to starvation.

Answer: {true}
"
1232,Is the average bulk carrier ideal for transporting bromine at room temperature?,"Bromine is a highly reactive, volatile, and corrosive element.  At room temperature, it exists as a reddish-brown liquid that readily evaporates, forming a toxic vapor.  Bulk carriers are designed for transporting large quantities of dry bulk goods like grains, ores, and coal.  They are not designed to handle hazardous liquids, particularly those with the corrosive and volatile properties of bromine.  Specialized containers and tankers with robust safety features are required for transporting such materials safely.  Therefore, a standard bulk carrier is not suitable for bromine transportation.

"
1233,Is Bern a poor choice for a xenophobic Swiss citizen to live?,"Bern is the capital city of Switzerland, a country known for its relatively high standard of living and generally welcoming attitude towards foreigners (although this can vary depending on individual experiences and local contexts).  While xenophobia exists in Switzerland as it does in many countries, Bern itself doesn't inherently possess characteristics that would make it a particularly *poor* choice for a xenophobic Swiss citizen to live.  A xenophobic individual might find anywhere suitable to live depending on their level of interaction with foreigners. Therefore, it's difficult to definitively say Bern is a worse choice than other Swiss cities.

Answer: {false}
"
1234,Are there tearjerkers about United Airlines flights?,"To determine if there are tearjerkers about United Airlines flights, we need to consider whether the emotional impact of a United Airlines flight has been the central theme of a movie or book considered a tearjerker.  While United Airlines flights are common in many films and books, the focus is rarely on the flight itself as the source of emotional weight.  Most stories using airline travel as a setting focus on other aspects – character relationships, plot developments, or destination-related conflicts.  There is no widely known or critically acclaimed ""tearjerker"" film or book solely centered around the emotional experience of being on a United Airlines flight.

1236,Would the yearly precipitation on Snowdon submerge an upright bowling pin?,"Explanation:
To determine if the yearly precipitation on Snowdon would submerge an upright bowling pin, we need to consider the amount of yearly precipitation on Snowdon and the dimensions of a bowling pin.

Snowdon's average annual rainfall is approximately 2000 mm (2 meters).  A bowling pin is roughly 38 cm (0.38 meters) tall.  The yearly rainfall significantly exceeds the height of a bowling pin.  Therefore, the amount of precipitation would easily submerge an upright bowling pin.

Answer: {false}
"
1239,Would a honey badger fit inside an oven?,"Honey badgers are relatively small, but their size varies.  A typical adult honey badger is about 24-30 inches long, not including its tail.  Ovens vary in size, but even a small oven would likely be larger than a honey badger. While a honey badger might be able to squeeze into a very small oven, it's unlikely to be comfortable.  However, considering the flexibility of a honey badger and the variability in oven sizes, it's possible that a small enough oven could technically fit a honey badger.


Answer: {true}
"
1240,Would Phineas and Ferb enjoy winter?,"Phineas and Ferb are known for their inventive and energetic personalities, constantly seeking out new and exciting activities.  Winter, with its potential for snow, ice, and unique weather conditions, offers a multitude of opportunities for creative projects and outdoor adventures.  They could build snow forts, ice slides, or even invent a new type of snow vehicle.  While the colder temperatures might pose a slight challenge, their inventiveness would likely overcome this. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume they would enjoy winter.

Answer: {true}
"
1241,Do pirates care about vitamin C?,"Scurvy is a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency.  Historically, scurvy was a major problem for sailors on long voyages, because fresh fruits and vegetables, rich in vitamin C, were unavailable. Pirates were sailors, often spending extended periods at sea. Therefore, their health would have been affected by a lack of vitamin C.

1243,Did Alfred Hitchcock include internet slang in his films?,"Alfred Hitchcock directed his films between 1921 and 1976.  Internet slang did not exist until the advent and widespread use of the internet, which began in the late 1980s and became truly prevalent in the 1990s.  Therefore, it would be impossible for Hitchcock to have included internet slang in his films.

"
1244,Do Republicans reject all forms of welfare?,"The Republican Party platform contains a range of views on welfare.  While some Republicans advocate for significant cuts to welfare programs and a shift towards a more market-based approach to social safety nets, others support targeted assistance programs aimed at specific vulnerable populations.  There's no single, unified Republican position on all forms of welfare; the party encompasses a spectrum of opinions on the extent and type of government intervention in social welfare. Therefore, it's inaccurate to say they reject *all* forms of welfare.

1248,Would Alexander Hamilton have known about koalas?,"Alexander Hamilton was a Founding Father of the United States, living from 1755-1804.  Koalas are marsupials native to Australia.  Europeans did not widely know about Australia's fauna until much later, after extensive exploration and colonization.  Therefore, it's highly improbable Alexander Hamilton would have encountered any information about koalas.

Answer: {false}
"
1249,Are there options for students who struggle to understand the writing style of Othello?,"Shakespeare's language in Othello presents several challenges for modern readers.  The archaic vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and dramatic use of figurative language can make the play difficult to grasp.  To support students struggling with Othello, several options exist:

* **Modern translations and adaptations:**  These versions render the play in contemporary language, making the plot and characters more accessible.  While they might lose some of the poetic beauty of the original, they greatly improve comprehension.

* **Annotated editions:** These texts provide line-by-line explanations of difficult words, phrases, and allusions.  They often include contextual information and critical analyses to enhance understanding.

* **Study guides and lesson plans:** Many resources offer summaries, character analyses, and thematic discussions, providing a structured approach to comprehending the play's complexities.

* **Audio and visual aids:** Listening to audio versions of the play or watching film adaptations can help students visualize the action and hear the dialogue spoken aloud, making it easier to follow the narrative.

* **Classroom discussions and activities:** Engaging in collaborative activities like character analysis, debate, or creative writing assignments can encourage students to actively interact with the text and solidify their understanding.

* **Differentiated instruction:** Teachers can adapt their teaching methods to address the specific needs of individual students.  This might involve providing additional support to struggling readers, offering alternative assessment methods, or breaking down the text into smaller, more manageable chunks.

"
1251,Was historical Dracula from a town in Bucharest?,"Answer: Bram Stoker's Dracula was not based on a real historical figure.  The novel's Dracula is a fictional character, and while Stoker may have drawn inspiration from various sources and legends about vampires, there's no historical person he's based on from Bucharest or anywhere else. Therefore, the premise of the question is flawed.

"
1253,Does a mongoose have natural camouflage for desert?,"Mongooses are found in various habitats, including deserts, but they do not possess natural camouflage specifically adapted to desert environments.  Their coloration tends to vary depending on the species and their specific habitat, but it's generally not designed to blend seamlessly into sandy or rocky desert backgrounds like the camouflage of many desert animals. While some might have a sandy or light brown coat which *could* offer some degree of camouflage in certain situations, it's not a defining characteristic, and their camouflage is not specialized for desert terrains the way it is for some other desert-dwelling animals.

Answer: {false}
"
1254,Would Seroquel be the first treatment recommended by a doctor to someone with depression?,"Seroquel (quetiapine) is an atypical antipsychotic medication. While it can be used to treat depression in some cases, particularly in those with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia with depressive symptoms, it is generally not the *first* line treatment for depression.  First-line treatments typically include antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).  Antipsychotics like Seroquel are often reserved for cases where antidepressants have been ineffective or when there are other symptoms present, such as psychosis.

Answer: {false}
"
1255,Does the Taco Bell kitchen contain cinnamon?,"Taco Bell's menu includes items that contain cinnamon, such as the Cinnamon Twists.

Answer: {true}
"
1256,Would a member of the United States Air Force get a discount at Dunkin Donuts?,"The question asks whether a member of the United States Air Force would receive a discount at Dunkin' Donuts.  Dunkin' Donuts offers discounts to a variety of groups, often including members of the military. While specific promotions change, it's reasonable to assume that at some point in time, or possibly currently, there is a military discount offered.  Therefore, it's likely a member of the U.S. Air Force could get a discount.


Answer: {true}
"
1257,Does Thiago Moises May 13 2020 submission move hypothetically hurt Achilles?,"Thiago Moises's May 13, 2020 submission victory was a rear-naked choke.  Rear-naked chokes constrict blood flow to the brain, rendering an opponent unconscious.  While a rear-naked choke primarily targets the neck and head, it does not directly involve the Achilles tendon in the foot.  The mechanism of injury for the rear-naked choke is vastly different from any mechanism that would injure the Achilles tendon. Therefore, it's highly improbable that the submission move would directly hurt the Achilles tendon.

Answer: {false}
"
1258,Are quadrupeds represented on Chinese calendar?,"The Chinese zodiac consists of twelve animals, each representing a year in a repeating 12-year cycle.  These animals are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.  None of these animals are quadrupeds exclusively; some are quadrupeds (ox, tiger, horse, dog, pig), while others are not (rat, rabbit, monkey).  Since the Chinese zodiac features animals that are and aren't quadrupeds, it's inaccurate to say quadrupeds are *exclusively* represented.  However,  a significant number *are* quadrupeds.

Answer: {true}
"
1259,Would Nancy Pelosi publicly denounce abortion?,"Nancy Pelosi is a prominent Democrat and a strong supporter of abortion rights.

1267,Can whole genome sequencing be used for COVID-19?,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful technique that can be used to determine the complete DNA sequence of an organism.  In the context of COVID-19, WGS plays a crucial role in several ways:

* **Tracking Variants:** WGS allows scientists to identify and track the emergence and spread of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This information is vital for understanding the virus's evolution and developing effective vaccines and treatments.  Different variants may have different characteristics, such as increased transmissibility or resistance to existing treatments.

* **Epidemiological Investigations:** By sequencing the genomes of viruses from infected individuals, researchers can trace transmission chains and identify outbreaks. This helps public health officials implement targeted interventions to control the spread of the virus.

* **Developing Diagnostics and Therapeutics:** WGS data can inform the development of more accurate diagnostic tests and therapies. For example, understanding the genetic makeup of a variant can help scientists design drugs that specifically target that variant.

* **Understanding Viral Evolution:**  WGS data provides valuable insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of the virus, helping scientists predict future outbreaks and prepare for them.

Therefore, whole genome sequencing is a valuable tool for understanding, tracking, and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

"
1270,Do black swan cygnets typically know both of their genetic parents?,"Black swan cygnets are typically raised in a group setting called a ""creche,"" where multiple adults, including the parents and other unrelated adults, care for the young.  While the genetic parents are involved, it's highly unlikely a cygnet would have the ability to distinguish its genetic parents from other adults in the creche contributing to its care.  Therefore, they don't typically ""know"" their genetic parents in the way a human child might.

Answer: {false}
"

"
1273,Was Florence a Theocracy during Italian Renaissance?,"Florence during the Italian Renaissance was a republic, not a theocracy. While the Catholic Church held significant influence in Florentine society and politics, the city was governed by an elected body, not by religious leaders.  The Medici family, a powerful banking family, exerted considerable influence, but they didn't rule as religious authorities.  The city had its own laws, institutions, and systems of governance separate from direct ecclesiastical control.  Therefore, characterizing Florence as a theocracy during the Renaissance is inaccurate.

1279,Were French people involved in the American Civil War?,"France remained officially neutral during the American Civil War.  However, there were some French individuals who participated on both sides of the conflict.  Some French citizens may have joined the Union or Confederate armies as volunteers or mercenaries, seeking adventure, pay, or ideological reasons.  The extent of French involvement was relatively minor compared to the participation of other foreign nationals.  It's also important to note that the official French government maintained neutrality.

"
1284,Would Communist Party of the Soviet Union hypothetically support Trickle Down Economics?,"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was fundamentally opposed to capitalist principles. Trickle-down economics is a capitalist theory that posits that tax breaks and benefits for corporations and the wealthy will eventually ""trickle down"" to benefit the lower classes through job creation and economic growth.  The CPSU advocated for a centrally planned economy and the abolition of private property, directly contradicting the core tenets of trickle-down economics. Therefore, the CPSU would not support trickle-down economics.

"
1287,Could Eddie Murphy's children hypothetically fill a basketball court by themselves?,"Explanation:
To determine if Eddie Murphy's children could hypothetically fill a basketball court by themselves, we need to consider the number of his children and their size.  Eddie Murphy has 10 children.  Even if his children are small, 10 people of any reasonable size are likely to occupy a significant portion of a basketball court, if not the entire court depending on how closely they are positioned.  It is reasonable to assume that 10 children, even if smaller than average adults, could fill a basketball court if standing relatively close together.

"
1289,Would a house full of aloe vera hypothetically be ideal for Unsinkable Sam?,"Unsinkable Sam was a cat who survived several ship sinkings during World War II.  Aloe vera is a plant known for its soothing properties, often used to treat burns and other skin irritations. While a house full of aloe vera might provide a soothing environment, it wouldn't directly address the survival needs of a cat in a dangerous situation like a shipwreck.  The cat would need food, water, and shelter from the elements, not just a soothing plant. Therefore, a house full of aloe vera would not be ideal for Unsinkable Sam's survival in such circumstances.

"
1298,Could Bart Simpson have owned comics with The Joker?,"The Simpsons is set in Springfield, USA.  The Joker is a DC Comics character. DC Comics is a real-world entity, and its comic books featuring the Joker exist in the real world and would therefore exist within the fictional world of The Simpsons.  Therefore, it's plausible Bart Simpson could have owned comics featuring The Joker.

Answer: {true}
"
1299,Would a customer be happy if their grocery store meat tasted like game?,"The question asks whether a customer would be happy if their grocery store meat tasted like game.  Most people are accustomed to the taste of commercially raised meat, which is generally milder than game meat. Game meat, such as venison or wild boar, often has a stronger, gamier flavor that some people find unpleasant.  Therefore, it's unlikely a customer expecting the typical taste of grocery store meat would be happy if their purchase tasted like game.

Answer: {false}
"
1308,Do Jews believe in any New Testament angels?,"Judaism does not accept the New Testament as scripture.  The New Testament features angels and narratives not recognized within Jewish theology. Therefore, Jews would not believe in New Testament angels in the same way Christians do.  While some angels are mentioned in both the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and later Jewish texts, the specific angels and narratives presented in the New Testament are outside the scope of Jewish belief.

Answer: {false}
"
1309,Does the actress who played Elizabeth II speak fluent Arabic?,"The question asks whether the actress who played Queen Elizabeth II speaks fluent Arabic.  To answer this, we need to identify the actress and then determine if she is fluent in Arabic.  The most famous actress to portray Queen Elizabeth II is Claire Foy in the Netflix series *The Crown*.  There is no publicly available information suggesting Claire Foy speaks fluent Arabic.  While it's possible she knows some Arabic, there's no evidence to support fluency.

1310,Can Kane challenge Joe Biden in this year's primaries?,"Explanation:
The 2024 US Presidential election primaries are underway.  To challenge Joe Biden in the Democratic primary, Kane would need to meet several criteria:  he would need to be eligible to run for President (a US-born citizen at least 35 years old), register as a candidate, and gather enough signatures or meet other requirements to appear on the primary ballots in various states.  Most importantly, there is no public information suggesting that anyone named ""Kane"" is currently running, or planning to run, against Biden. The field of candidates is generally well-known and documented by reputable news sources.


Answer: {false}
"
1311,Could  jockey win Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endpoints?,"To determine if a jockey could win the Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endpoints, we need to consider the timing of the Triple Crown races and the dates of Eid al-Fitr.

The Triple Crown races (Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes) are typically held in May and June.  Eid al-Fitr's date varies based on the lunar calendar, but it generally falls in late April or early May.

If Eid al-Fitr falls early enough in the year, it's *possible* for the entire Triple Crown to be run between its endpoints. However, it's not guaranteed.  The precise dates of Eid al-Fitr and the Triple Crown races vary from year to year.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether this is always true or always false without specifying the year.

Answer: {true}
"
1315,Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?,"Explanation:
Ten gallons of seawater weighs approximately 83 pounds.  While 83 pounds is a significant weight, it is unlikely to crush a six-year-old child.  The pressure would be distributed across the child's body, and a child's body is relatively resilient.  To crush someone, a much greater force concentrated over a smaller area would be required.  Therefore, ten gallons of seawater would not be able to crush a six-year-old.

Answer: {false}
"
1316,Does someone from Japan need a passport to go to a Nordic country?,"Citizens of Japan need a passport to travel internationally.  Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) are not part of Japan. Therefore, a Japanese citizen would require a passport to travel to any of the Nordic countries.

Answer: {true}
"
1317,Could John Key issue an executive order in the USA?,"Explanation: John Key was the Prime Minister of New Zealand, not the United States.

Answer: {false}
"
1318,Is Freya a combination of Athena and Aphrodite?,"The question asks if Freya is a combination of Athena and Aphrodite.  Freya is a Norse goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, gold, war, and death. Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts, while Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation.  While Freya shares some attributes with both Athena (warfare) and Aphrodite (love and beauty), she is a distinct goddess within the Norse pantheon and not a direct combination or fusion of the Greek goddesses.  The question implies a direct merging of identities, which is inaccurate.  They are separate figures from different mythologies with overlapping but not identical domains.

Answer: {false}
"
1319,Did Jack Dempsey have most title fight wins in either of his weight classes?,"Jack Dempsey held the world heavyweight championship from 1919 to 1926.  To determine if he had the most title fight wins in his weight class, we need to compare his record to other heavyweight champions.  While he had a significant number of title defenses, definitively stating whether he holds the record for most title fight wins requires a detailed examination of heavyweight boxing history, comparing his record to champions both before and after him.  This is a complex question requiring further research to provide a definitive answer. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer this based on common knowledge.

Answer: {false}
"
1320,Could you watch a new Seinfeld episode every day for a year?,"Explanation: There are 365 days in a year.  A new Seinfeld episode would need to be available for each of those days to make this possible.  The Seinfeld TV show ended after nine seasons.  Therefore, there are not enough episodes to watch a new one every day for an entire year.

This would likely cause panic among the kitchen staff as they try to manage the situation.

Answer: {true}
"
1323,Was being a mail carrier considered one of the most dangerous jobs?,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that mail carriers face a higher-than-average risk of assault and other violent crimes.  While the exact ranking fluctuates year to year, and depends on how ""dangerous"" is defined (fatal accidents vs. injury rates, etc.), mail carriers consistently appear among the occupations with higher-than-average rates of workplace violence. Therefore, it's reasonable to consider that at some point, being a mail carrier was considered one of the most dangerous jobs.

Answer: {true}
"
1324,Would a duck ever need a Caesarean section?,"Answer: Ducks, being birds, lay eggs.  A Caesarean section is a surgical procedure performed on mammals to deliver offspring.  Therefore, a duck would never need a Caesarean section.

"
1325,Would a tool used for Martin Luther's Reformation opening salvo aid in a crucifixion?,"Martin Luther's Reformation opening salvo was the posting of his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517.  The Ninety-Five Theses were a list of propositions for debate, primarily concerning the sale of indulgences.  They were not a tool in the physical sense.  A tool used in a crucifixion would be something like a hammer, nails, or a wooden cross.  Therefore, a tool used for Luther's Ninety-Five Theses could not be used in a crucifixion.

Answer: {false}
"
1326,"If you bottle your own milk, would there be cream on top of it?","Explanation:  Cream rises to the top of milk due to the difference in density between the fat globules (cream) and the skim milk.  When you bottle your own milk,  the fat globules will still separate and rise, resulting in a layer of cream on top.

Answer: {true}
"
1327,Is it safe to use Ammonia with Clorox?,"Mixing ammonia and Clorox (bleach) can create toxic gases, including chloramine.

Answer: {false}
"
1328,Would a Deacon be likely to be a fan of the podcast 'God Awful Movies'?,"The podcast ""God Awful Movies"" reviews bad movies, often with comedic commentary.  A deacon, as a member of the clergy, might or might not be a fan of such a podcast.  While some deacons might enjoy humorous content, others might find the subject matter inappropriate or not aligned with their religious beliefs. Therefore, there's no inherent connection between being a deacon and enjoying this particular podcast.

Answer: {false}
"
1329,Can you worship Ahura Mazda at a mosque?,"Answer: Ahura Mazda is the supreme god in Zoroastrianism.  Mosques are places of worship for Muslims, who follow Islam.

"
1333,Does Robert Downey Jr's Marvel Cinematic Universe character survive the Infinity War?,"Answer: Robert Downey Jr.'s character, Tony Stark, or Iron Man, appears to die at the end of Avengers: Infinity War, sacrificing himself to defeat Thanos.  However, he is resurrected in Avengers: Endgame.  Therefore, whether he survives *Infinity War* depends on the interpretation of ""surviving"". If the question is asking if he survives the events of the movie without any further consideration, the answer is no.  If the question considers his eventual resurrection in a subsequent movie, the answer is yes. Since the question is simply if he survives Infinity War, the answer is based on the events of that singular movie.

Answer: {false}
"
1334,Would a compass attuned to Earth's magnetic field be a bad gift for a Christmas elf??,"Christmas elves, according to common lore, live at the North Pole.  The Earth's magnetic field lines converge at the magnetic poles, which are near but not exactly at the geographic North and South Poles.  A compass at the North Pole would likely be unreliable or point erratically due to the convergence of field lines and the proximity to the magnetic pole.  Therefore, a compass would not be a useful or practical gift for a Christmas elf.

Answer: {true}
"
1335,Are tampons a good 24 hour solution for mentruation?,"Tampons are designed for internal use during menstruation to absorb menstrual flow.  However, they are not designed for 24-hour continuous use.  Leaving a tampon in for an extended period (longer than 4-8 hours, depending on the flow) significantly increases the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a serious and potentially life-threatening bacterial infection.  Therefore, tampons are not a good 24-hour solution for menstruation, and frequent changes are crucial for hygiene and safety.

Answer: {false}
"
1336,Are all characters in Legend of Robin Hood fictional?,"The Legend of Robin Hood, while based on a historical figure, embellishes the story with fictional characters and events. While there may be a kernel of truth regarding a Robin Hood-like figure in the medieval era, the specific characters and plot points within ""The Legend of Robin Hood"" are generally considered fictional creations.  Therefore, the characters depicted in a specific rendition of the Legend of Robin Hood are largely fictional.

1339,Did Nine Inch Nails inspire Aretha Franklin's sound?,"Nine Inch Nails' music is characterized by industrial rock, electronic, and alternative metal sounds.  Aretha Franklin's music is rooted in soul, gospel, R&B, and blues.  There is no evidence or connection to suggest that Nine Inch Nails' industrial sound influenced the soul and gospel-based music of Aretha Franklin.  Their musical styles are distinctly different and emerged from separate genres.

"
1342,"In American society, will a bachelor's degree often include a leap year?","A bachelor's degree program typically spans four years.  A leap year occurs every four years.

It's highly probable, but not absolutely certain.

Answer: {true}

1343,Did children read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone during the Albanian Civil War?,"The Albanian Civil War took place from 1997 to 1999.  ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" was published in the UK in 1997 and in the US in 1998.  While the exact timing of its translation and distribution in Albania is not readily available, it's highly probable that some children in Albania would have had access to the book, either through official channels or otherwise, during or shortly after the conflict.  The presence of war doesn't eliminate access to books entirely, although availability would likely be impacted and vary across the region.

Answer: {true}
"
1344,Did Jay-Z ever collaborate with Louis Armstrong?,"Jay-Z is a contemporary hip-hop artist, while Louis Armstrong was a legendary jazz musician who died in 1971.  There is no record of any collaboration between them, given the significant time difference in their careers.

"
1345,Would it be wise to bring a robusto into Central Park Zoo?,"Bringing a robusto, which is a type of cigar, into Central Park Zoo would likely be prohibited.  Zoos typically have strict rules against smoking and bringing in potentially flammable or hazardous materials to protect the animals, visitors, and the zoo's facilities.  The smoke could irritate animals, and the cigar itself presents a fire hazard.

"
1347,Did Al Capone carry a smartphone?,"Al Capone was a gangster active during the Prohibition era in the United States (roughly 1920-1933). Smartphones did not exist until the late 1990s.  Therefore, it is impossible for Al Capone to have carried a smartphone.

Answer: {false}
"
1348,Is Benjamin Franklin a prime candidate to have his statues removed by Black Lives Matter movement?,"Benjamin Franklin, a prominent Founding Father, is a complex figure with a mixed legacy. While he is celebrated for his contributions to the founding of the United States, his involvement in the institution of slavery casts a shadow on his historical image.  The Black Lives Matter movement focuses on dismantling systems of oppression and highlighting the hypocrisy of figures who espoused liberty while simultaneously engaging in practices that denied freedom to others.  Franklin's ownership of slaves and his publication of advertisements for the sale of enslaved people would likely be seen by many within the movement as directly contradicting the ideals of equality and justice they champion.  Therefore, he could be considered a prime candidate for statue removal, given the movement's focus on confronting historical figures whose actions are at odds with the principles of racial equality.

Answer: {true}
"
1349,Would Jason Voorhees hypothetically fail at being a martyr?,"Jason Voorhees, the fictional killer from the Friday the 13th franchise, is defined by his relentless pursuit of violence and murder.  Martyrs, by definition, die for a cause or belief, often making a significant sacrifice. Jason's actions are driven by revenge and rage, not a selfless commitment to any ideal or higher purpose. His continued survival across multiple films directly contradicts the idea of martyrdom, which necessitates death.  Therefore, he would fail spectacularly at being a martyr.

Answer: {false}
"
1350,Would a teacher still have their job if they called a black student an ape?,"Explanation:
Calling a Black student an ape is a racist and deeply offensive act.  Such behavior is unacceptable in a professional environment and constitutes grounds for immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  Most schools and educational institutions have clear policies against racial discrimination and harassment.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely a teacher would retain their job after committing such a blatant act of racism.

Answer: {false}
"
1351,Would Eye surgery on a fly be in vain?,"Answer: A fly's eye is compound, meaning it's made up of many individual lenses called ommatidia.  These lenses are quite different structurally and functionally from a human eye.  Surgery techniques developed for human eyes would be completely inappropriate and ineffective for a fly's eye.  Therefore, any attempt at eye surgery on a fly would be futile.

Answer: {true}
"
1352,Are rainbows devoid of color made by mixing yin and yang colors?,"Rainbows are formed by the refraction and reflection of sunlight through water droplets.  The colors we see are the result of different wavelengths of light being bent at slightly different angles.  The concept of yin and yang is a Taoist philosophy representing opposing but complementary forces, not a physical process related to light or color. Mixing yin and yang colors is not a scientifically valid concept concerning rainbow formation. Therefore, rainbows are not devoid of color due to the mixing of yin and yang.  They are colorful because of the physical properties of light.


Answer: {false}
"
1353,Did mongoose come from later period than rhinos?,"The question asks whether mongooses evolved later than rhinoceroses.  To answer this, we need to consider the evolutionary timelines of both groups.  Rhinoceroses are perissodactyls (odd-toed ungulates) with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Eocene epoch, around 56 million years ago.  Mongooses, on the other hand, belong to the Carnivora order and have a more recent evolutionary history. While the precise timing is debated, their evolutionary lineage is significantly younger than that of rhinoceroses.

"
1356,Is Bill Gates the wealthiest of the Baby Boomers?,"To determine if Bill Gates is the wealthiest Baby Boomer, we need to consider the net worth of other prominent Baby Boomers.  While Bill Gates' net worth is substantial, other Baby Boomers like Warren Buffett also possess immense wealth.  A definitive answer requires comparing their net worths at a specific point in time, which fluctuates.  While Bill Gates has often held the title of richest person in the world, it's not guaranteed he's the wealthiest *Baby Boomer* consistently.  The ranking among the ultra-wealthy changes frequently.

Answer: {false}
"
1357,Do Windows or Android smartphones run newer versions of Linux?,"Neither Windows nor Android smartphones run newer versions of Linux.

Answer: {false}
"
1359,Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?,"Explanation:

Determining who more people are related to requires considering the vastness of each individual's descendants. Genghis Khan, as a powerful ruler who fathered many children and whose descendants spread widely across Asia, likely has a far greater number of living descendants than Julius Caesar.  While Julius Caesar's lineage continues, the sheer scale of Genghis Khan's empire and the documented prolificacy of his descendants make it highly probable that more people alive today are related to him than to Julius Caesar.

1361,Do some psychotherapy patients have no mental illness?,"Psychotherapy is a form of treatment that involves talking with a therapist to address various emotional, psychological, and behavioral issues. While many people who seek psychotherapy have diagnosable mental illnesses,  it's not a requirement.  People might seek therapy for a variety of reasons that don't necessarily constitute a clinical disorder. These reasons could include:  stress management, improving coping mechanisms, navigating life transitions (like divorce, job loss, or bereavement), relationship difficulties, or personal growth.  Therefore, it's entirely possible for psychotherapy patients to not have a diagnosable mental illness.

Answer: {true}
"
1362,Can an art dealer buy Boeing 737-800 with a Da Vinci painting?,"The value of a Da Vinci painting is incredibly high, potentially exceeding the cost of a Boeing 737-800.  However, the actual sale price of a Da Vinci painting and the purchase price of a Boeing 737-800 are subject to market fluctuations and negotiations. While it is *possible* an art dealer could leverage the value of a Da Vinci painting to buy a Boeing 737-800, it's not guaranteed.  The art dealer would need to find a buyer for the painting and then negotiate the purchase of the plane.  This is a complex transaction with many variables that could influence the outcome.

1363,"Was the British car, the Mini, the first car manufactured?","The first car is generally considered to be the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, invented by Karl Benz in 1886.  The Mini was produced much later, in 1959.  Therefore, the Mini was not the first car manufactured.

Answer: {false}
"
1364,Would early Eastern Canadian Natives language have use of the letter B?,"The question asks whether early Eastern Canadian Native languages used the letter ""B"".  The answer depends on the specific language and the writing system used.  Many Indigenous languages of Eastern Canada were originally oral traditions, and didn't have a written form using the Latin alphabet until much later, often imposed by Europeans.  The sounds represented by the letter ""B"" might have existed in the spoken language, but they may have been represented by different letters or combinations of letters in later written forms, or not represented at all if the writing system didn't map perfectly to the sounds of the language.  Therefore, a definitive yes or no answer is difficult without specifying a particular language. The question is too broad.

Answer: {false}
"
1365,Does a Trek 9000 require an anchor in order to park?,"A Trek 9000 is a bicycle.  Bicycles do not require anchors to park.  They are typically parked by leaning them against something, using a bike rack, or locking them to a fixed object.

"
1368,Is breakdancing safe for people with tendonitis?,"Breakdancing involves repetitive, high-impact movements and sudden, jarring motions. These actions place significant stress on joints and tendons, particularly in the wrists, ankles, and knees.  Tendonitis is an inflammation of the tendons, often caused by overuse or repetitive strain.  The strenuous nature of breakdancing would almost certainly exacerbate existing tendonitis and could very likely cause new instances of the condition. Therefore, breakdancing is not safe for people with tendonitis.

Answer: {false}
"
1369,Did Marco Polo travel with Christopher Columbus?,"Marco Polo's travels took place in the 13th century, while Christopher Columbus's voyages were in the late 15th century.  Therefore, they could not have traveled together.

"
1372,Can a traffic collision make someone a millionaire?,"Explanation:
A traffic collision, while potentially causing significant injury and property damage, does not directly result in someone becoming a millionaire.  While a large settlement from a lawsuit stemming from a collision is possible, this is contingent upon proving significant damages and negligence.  The likelihood of a settlement reaching millions of dollars is relatively low, and even then, it wouldn't be automatic.  Becoming a millionaire typically requires substantial wealth accumulation through investments, business ventures, inheritance, or other means that are not directly caused by a traffic accident.

1375,Would a pacifist be opposed to hunting?,"Answer: A pacifist is someone who opposes violence and war. Hunting, depending on the context, can involve the killing of animals.  While some might argue hunting for sustenance is different from violence against humans, a strict pacifist would likely oppose the intentional taking of a life, even that of an animal. Therefore, a pacifist would likely be opposed to hunting.

Answer: {true}
"
1376,Are selfies more dangerous than plague in modern times?,"Explanation:

The plague, or bubonic plague, is a serious bacterial infection that can be fatal if left untreated.  Historically, it has caused devastating pandemics.  While still a threat in some parts of the world, modern medicine has greatly reduced its mortality rate and prevalence.

Selfies, on the other hand, present a different kind of danger. While not inherently deadly like the plague, the pursuit of the perfect selfie has led to numerous injuries and deaths due to falls from heights, drownings, traffic accidents, and other risky behaviors.  The number of deaths and injuries directly attributable to selfie-related incidents is significant, although not on the scale of a major plague outbreak.

Comparing the two directly is difficult as they represent different kinds of risks. However, it's inaccurate to say selfies are *more* dangerous than the plague in modern times considering the plague's historical and continued potential for widespread mortality. The number of deaths caused by selfies is significantly lower.  The danger posed by selfies is arguably more a result of human behavior and risk-taking than an inherent danger in the act itself.


Answer: {false}
"
1377,Could you watch Naruto and Puzzle Place on the same channel?,"Naruto and Puzzle Place are not likely to be shown on the same channel.  Naruto is an anime series aimed at a teen/young adult audience, while Puzzle Place is a children's show.  Channels typically program to a specific demographic, and it's unlikely one channel would cater to both those very different age groups simultaneously.

Answer: {false}
"
1378,Could Johnny Carson's children fill out a water polo team?,"Johnny Carson had three children: Cory, Christopher, and Richard.  A water polo team typically consists of 7 players.  Since 3 is less than 7, his children alone could not fill a water polo team.

"
1379,Did the Cherokee people send a delegation to oppose allotment?,"The Dawes Act of 1887, also known as the General Allotment Act, aimed to assimilate Native Americans by breaking up tribal communal land ownership and allotting individual plots to tribal members.  Many Native American tribes, including the Cherokee, strongly opposed this act because it threatened their traditional way of life and sovereignty. They recognized the allotment process as a way to weaken their tribal structure and ultimately dispossess them of their land.  Therefore, it's highly probable that the Cherokee sent delegations to oppose the allotment.

Answer: {true}
"
1380,Do pediatricians perform abortions?,"Pediatricians specialize in the care of children.  Abortions are a medical procedure performed to terminate a pregnancy.

Their training and focus are entirely different.

"
1384,Would the United States Military Academy reject an applicant with multiple sclerosis?,"The United States Military Academy at West Point has high physical fitness standards for its cadets.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, potentially debilitating disease that affects the central nervous system.  The unpredictable nature of MS, and its potential to impact physical abilities and cognitive function, would likely make it very difficult, if not impossible, for an applicant to meet the demanding physical and mental requirements of West Point.  While the academy doesn't explicitly list MS as a disqualifying condition, the impact on an individual's physical capabilities and overall health would almost certainly lead to rejection.

Answer: {true}
"
1385,Does USA fail separation of church and state in multiple ways?,"The separation of church and state in the USA is a complex and debated topic.  While the First Amendment explicitly prohibits the establishment of a state religion and guarantees freedom of religious exercise, the application of this principle has been far from consistent throughout US history.  Several ways in which the separation is arguably violated include:

* **School Prayer and Religious Instruction:**  The ongoing debate over prayer in public schools, the teaching of creationism alongside evolution, and the presence of religious symbols in public schools demonstrates a blurring of lines between religious and secular institutions.

* **Government Funding of Religious Organizations:**  Government funding of religious charities, schools, and other organizations raises questions about whether this constitutes an endorsement of religion by the state.

* **Religious Displays on Public Property:** The placement of nativity scenes, Ten Commandments monuments, and other religious displays on government property has been frequently challenged in court, highlighting the ongoing tension between religious expression and government neutrality.

* **Political Influence of Religious Groups:**  The significant influence of religious groups in American politics, lobbying for policies aligned with their beliefs, raises concerns about the potential for religious views to unduly sway government decisions.

* **Pledges of Allegiance and Oaths:** The inclusion of the phrase ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a point of contention for those who view it as a violation of church-state separation.

While the legal interpretations of these issues vary, and the Supreme Court has addressed many cases related to church-state separation, the ongoing controversies demonstrate that the ideal of complete separation is often challenged in practice.  The multifaceted nature of American society and its history ensures that interpretations of separation continue to be debated and refined.


Answer: {true}
"
1386,Is Jesse W. Moore a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA?,"Explanation:
To determine if Jesse W. Moore is a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA, we need to consider NASA's association with Snoopy and the types of awards they give.  NASA uses Snoopy imagery in its safety awards.  The awards are given to individuals and teams for safety achievements and contributions to promoting a culture of safety.  Therefore, if Jesse W. Moore has demonstrated significant contributions to NASA's safety record or safety culture, he would be a potential recipient.  However, without further information about Jesse W. Moore's professional activities and contributions to NASA, we cannot definitively say whether he is or isn't a potential recipient.

1387,Can you get Raclette in YMCA headquarters city?,"The YMCA's headquarters city is Chicago, Illinois.  Raclette is a Swiss cheese dish.  The question asks if Raclette is available in Chicago.  Given that Chicago is a large and diverse city with many restaurants and a varied food scene, it's highly probable that one could find a restaurant serving Raclette, though it might not be ubiquitous.  However, the question doesn't require certainty, only the possibility.

1390,Does water have viscosity?,"Water, like all fluids, possesses viscosity, albeit a low one. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.  While water flows relatively easily compared to substances like honey or motor oil, it still exhibits internal friction between its molecules, meaning it offers some resistance to flow.  This resistance is responsible for phenomena like the formation of eddies in flowing water and the gradual slowing of a ball moving through water.

Answer: {true}
"
1391,Would a loudspeaker be useful for most Gallaudet students?,"Gallaudet University is a university for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.

1408,Do people with DID have a good memory?,"Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, involves the presence of two or more distinct personality states.  Memory is often fragmented and affected in DID.  Individuals may experience amnesia for certain periods of time, events, or even personal information.  While some memories may be intact within specific personality states, there's often a lack of continuity and integration across all alters.  Therefore, people with DID typically do *not* have a good, overall memory.  They may have good memory within specific alters, but not across all of their experiences.

1409,Is CAS number 8009-03-8 harmful for a rash?,"CAS number 8009-03-8 refers to heparin, a blood thinner.  Heparin is not typically applied topically to treat rashes.  While it's possible for a topical application of heparin to cause irritation or allergic reaction leading to a worsening rash in some individuals, it is not a treatment for rashes and its use in this way would be highly unusual and inappropriate.  Therefore, it's not directly ""harmful"" in the sense of causing a rash, but its application to a rash could be harmful due to potential adverse reactions.

1412,Does walking across Amazonas put a person's life at risk?,"Answer: The Amazon rainforest is a vast and dangerous place.  It contains numerous threats to human life, including dangerous animals (e.g., jaguars, snakes, insects carrying diseases), difficult terrain, and the potential for getting lost.  Furthermore, depending on the specific route and time of year, there's a risk of extreme weather conditions.  The lack of readily available infrastructure and medical care in many parts of the Amazon increases the risk associated with accidents or illnesses. Therefore, walking across the Amazon rainforest would indeed put a person's life at significant risk.

1414,Can horseradish be eaten in a religious context?,"Horseradish is not intrinsically linked to any major religious tradition's dietary laws or rituals.  While some cultures might use it in specific dishes served during festivals or celebrations, its use isn't prescribed or prohibited by major religious texts or practices.  Its presence in food is largely a matter of personal preference and culinary tradition, not religious observance.

1416,Does Masaharu Morimoto rely on glutamic acid?,"Masaharu Morimoto is a renowned chef known for his expertise in Japanese cuisine, particularly in the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients and traditional techniques. While glutamic acid (the chemical compound that gives umami its taste) is naturally present in many foods like soy sauce, kombu (kelp), and mushrooms – all staples in Japanese cooking and frequently used by Morimoto – it's unlikely he relies on *added* glutamic acid in the way that a processed food manufacturer might.  His cooking style emphasizes natural flavors and the balance of ingredients.  Therefore, while glutamic acid plays a role in the flavor profiles of many of his dishes, he's more likely to achieve umami through the natural presence of glutamic acid in his chosen ingredients rather than through direct addition.

Answer: {true}
"
1418,Could one Amazon share ever buy twenty year Netflix subscription?,"Here's an explanation to determine whether one Amazon share could ever buy a twenty-year Netflix subscription:

To answer this, we need to consider the fluctuating prices of both Amazon stock and Netflix subscriptions.  The price of an Amazon share changes constantly based on market conditions.  Similarly, Netflix subscription prices have increased over time and may continue to do so.

Therefore, whether a single Amazon share could ever purchase a twenty-year Netflix subscription depends entirely on the price of the Amazon share at the time of purchase *and* the total cost of the Netflix subscription over twenty years (which would require predicting future price increases).  It's entirely possible that at some point in time, the price of an Amazon share could be high enough to cover even a very expensive, decades-long Netflix subscription; or it could be so low that it wouldn't be possible. The question is asking about potential, not current reality.

1420,Did a Mediterranean Sea creature kill Steve Irwin?,"Steve Irwin, the Australian zoologist, was killed by a stingray barb.  Stingrays are found in the ocean, but not specifically the Mediterranean Sea.  They are more commonly found in warmer waters such as the waters surrounding Australia.

Answer: {false}
"
1421,Can E6000 cure before a hoverboard finishes the Daytona 500?,"The question asks whether E6000 adhesive can cure before a hoverboard completes the Daytona 500.  This requires considering the cure time of E6000 and the time it would take a hoverboard to complete the Daytona 500.

E6000 adhesive typically cures completely in 24-72 hours, depending on environmental factors like temperature and humidity.

A hoverboard completing the Daytona 500 is highly improbable, if not impossible. The Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race for stock cars, requiring significant speed and durability. A hoverboard lacks the necessary speed, stability, and safety features for such a race.  It's unlikely a hoverboard could even complete a single lap, let alone the entire 500 miles.


Therefore, the E6000 adhesive will almost certainly cure before a hypothetical hoverboard finishes the Daytona 500, even considering the longest possible cure time for the adhesive.

Answer: {true}
"
1422,Could Cosmic Girls play League of Legends alone?,"Cosmic Girls is a K-pop group, consisting of multiple members.  A single person cannot be a group. Therefore, Cosmic Girls as a collective cannot play League of Legends alone; they would need individual members to play separately or as a team.

"
1423,Is Y2K relevant to the plot of The Godfather?,"The Y2K problem, or the year 2000 problem, refers to a potential computer error at the start of the year 2000 due to the date format used by many computer systems.  This technological issue is entirely unrelated to the plot of *The Godfather*, which focuses on the Corleone crime family and their activities in the mid-20th century. The film's narrative deals with themes of family, power, loyalty, and organized crime, all of which are completely separate from the Y2K bug.  There is no connection between the two.

"
1424,"On August 20, 2020,  does The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon air after moonset EST?","To determine if The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon aired after moonset EST on August 20, 2020, we need to know the moonset time in EST and the air time of the show.

The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon typically airs at 11:35 PM EST.  We need to find the moonset time for August 20, 2020, in a specific EST location (as moonset time varies slightly by location).  This information is readily available through online astronomical calculators or websites that provide moonset data for specific dates and locations.

Let's assume, for the sake of example, that the moonset time in a major EST city like New York on August 20, 2020, was 10:00 PM EST. In this scenario, The Tonight Show would have aired after moonset. However, if the moonset time was later than 11:35 PM EST, then the show would have aired *before* moonset.

Without knowing the precise moonset time for August 20, 2020, in a specific EST location, we cannot definitively answer the question.  Therefore, we cannot give a true or false answer.  Further information is needed.

"
1425,Would a student of the class of 2017 have amnesia about 9/11?,"Answer: A student in the class of 2017 would have been born, at the latest, in 2000.  The September 11th attacks occurred in 2001.  Therefore, a student graduating in 2017 would have been too young to have any memory of the events of 9/11.  They would not have amnesia about it, but rather simply lack personal experience of it.

"
1427,Will twenty pea pods contents cover entire chess board?,"A standard chessboard has 64 squares.  Let's assume each pea pod contains an average of 10 peas (this is a reasonable estimate, though it can vary).  Twenty pea pods would therefore contain approximately 200 peas.  Even if the peas were perfectly round and arranged with no gaps, it's highly unlikely that 200 peas could cover the entire area of a chessboard, which is relatively large.  The peas would not likely fill up the squares, leaving a significant amount of uncovered space.

Answer: {false}
"
1428,Were there footprints on the moon in 1960?,"The Apollo 11 mission, which first landed humans on the moon, took place in July 1969, not 1960.  Therefore, there were no footprints on the moon in 1960.

Answer: {false}
"
1429,Can the Supreme Court of Canada fight a Lucha trios match?,"The Supreme Court of Canada is a judicial body, not a group of professional wrestlers.  A Lucha trios match requires physical athleticism and training, which are not skills or attributes associated with Supreme Court justices.  Therefore, they would be unable to participate in such a match.

Answer: {false}
"
1430,Could the Atlantic readers fill 500 battalions?,"The question asks if the readership of the Atlantic could fill 500 battalions.  To answer this, we need to estimate the Atlantic's readership and the size of a battalion.

* **Atlantic Readership:**  The Atlantic doesn't publicly release precise readership numbers, but estimates place it in the millions. Let's assume a generous estimate of 5 million readers for simplicity.

* **Battalion Size:** A battalion's size varies depending on the military and time period.  A common estimate is around 500-1000 soldiers. Let's use a conservative estimate of 500 soldiers per battalion.

* **Calculation:** 500 battalions * 500 soldiers/battalion = 250,000 soldiers needed.

Since our generous estimate of 5 million Atlantic readers vastly exceeds the 250,000 soldiers needed to fill 500 battalions, the answer is yes.  However, it's important to note that this assumes *every* reader is physically capable and willing to serve.

Answer: {true}

1432,Did Dr. Seuss live a tragedy free life?,"Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, experienced significant personal tragedies throughout his life.  His first wife, Helen Palmer Geisel, died in 1967 after a long illness. This loss deeply affected him.  While he later remarried, the grief from losing his first wife undoubtedly had a profound impact on him. Therefore, it's inaccurate to say he lived a tragedy-free life.

Answer: {false}
"
1433,Are Christmas trees dissimilar to deciduous trees?,"Christmas trees, while varying in species, are generally evergreen conifers.  Deciduous trees, by definition, lose their leaves seasonally.

"
1435,Was song of Roland protagonist friendly with group that had sagas?,"The Song of Roland is a medieval French epic poem.  The protagonist, Roland, is a paladin of Charlemagne. The poem details Roland's actions and those of his companions against the Saracens. While the poem itself doesn't explicitly mention Roland being friendly with any group that had sagas (meaning collections of Norse or other tales),  the context suggests otherwise.  Roland is fiercely loyal to Charlemagne and his Christian faith, and he fights against the enemies of the Frankish kingdom. The themes of the Song of Roland are very different from those typically found in Norse sagas.  There's no evidence to support friendship or even interaction between Roland's group and groups documented in sagas.

Answer: {false}
"
1436,Are all cucumbers the same texture?,"The texture of a cucumber can vary depending on several factors, including its variety, ripeness, and growing conditions.  While many cucumbers share a similar crispness when relatively young,  overripe cucumbers become softer and sometimes even mushy.  Different varieties also have slightly different textures; some might be firmer and more crunchy than others. Therefore, not all cucumbers have the same texture.

Answer: {false}

Answer: {true}
"
1439,Does Hammurabi's Code violate Christians Golden Rule?,"Hammurabi's Code, an ancient Mesopotamian legal code, features the principle of ""an eye for an eye,"" which prescribes punishments proportionate to crimes committed.  This principle directly conflicts with the Christian Golden Rule, which emphasizes treating others as one would wish to be treated.  The Golden Rule promotes forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation, while Hammurabi's Code focuses on retribution and revenge.  The differences in philosophical underpinnings between the two systems are stark: one is based on compassion and empathy, while the other is based on a system of strict, often brutal, justice.  Therefore, Hammurabi's Code violates the spirit and intent of the Christian Golden Rule.

1440,Did any of religions in which Himalayas are sacred originate in 19th century?,"The Himalayas have been sacred to various religions for millennia, long predating the 19th century.  Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, all of which consider the Himalayas sacred to varying degrees, have histories stretching back far beyond the 19th century.  Therefore, no religions that hold the Himalayas sacred originated in the 19th century.

1441,Were the Ten commandments the part of the bible that Jewish people do not believe in?,"The Ten Commandments are a fundamental part of Jewish religious tradition and belief.  They are found in the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible), which is considered sacred scripture by Jewish people. While different Jewish denominations may interpret and apply the commandments in various ways,  the commandments themselves are not something that Jewish people, as a whole, do not believe in.

"
1442,Can you conduct surveillance from a teddy bear?,"Explanation:

The feasibility of conducting surveillance from a teddy bear depends heavily on the definition of ""surveillance"" and the technological capabilities integrated into the teddy bear.  A simple teddy bear, even with a hidden camera, would likely have limited capabilities.  Power limitations, storage capacity, and the difficulty of transmitting data discreetly would be significant obstacles.

However, with advancements in miniaturization and wireless technology, it's theoretically possible to create a teddy bear containing sophisticated surveillance equipment, including a high-resolution camera, a microphone, a data storage unit, and a low-power transmitter. The teddy bear could then transmit audio and video data wirelessly to a remote location.  The challenge would lie in concealing all of these components without compromising the teddy bear's appearance and functionality. This would require significant engineering.

Answer: {true}
"
1444,Can Tame Impala's studio band play a proper game of Hot Potato?,"Tame Impala's music is primarily created by Kevin Parker, although he collaborates with other musicians for live performances and recordings.  A ""studio band"" for Tame Impala isn't a consistently defined group of individuals in the same way as, say, a touring band for a rock group.  The musicians who contribute to Tame Impala's albums may vary from project to project.  Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say whether a specific group of musicians capable of playing Hot Potato exists as a consistent ""studio band"" for Tame Impala.

Answer: {false}

1445,Is it bad to have lactic acid in your body?,"Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, meaning the body produces it when it doesn't have enough oxygen to break down glucose completely.  While an excess of lactic acid can lead to muscle soreness, fatigue, and even more serious issues in extreme cases, it's not inherently ""bad"" to have lactic acid in your body.  In fact, it's a normal part of metabolic processes, and the body has mechanisms to remove it.  Problems arise only when its production significantly exceeds the body's capacity to clear it.

"
1446,Will Tokyo Tower be repainted only once during President Trump's first term?,"Explanation:

Donald Trump's first term as President of the United States was from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021.  Tokyo Tower's repainting schedule is not tied to US presidential terms.  Repainting is a periodic maintenance process, likely occurring over a much longer timeframe than four years.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that the repainting would only happen once during that specific four-year period.

Answer: {false}
"
1447,Would the crew of Apollo 15 have difficulty riding a unicycle?,"Answer: The Apollo 15 crew consisted of highly trained astronauts, but there's no indication that astronaut training included unicycle riding.

1449,Is Newspeak considered very straightforward?,"Newspeak, the fictional language in George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, is designed to limit thought and expression by reducing vocabulary and eliminating words that represent concepts considered dangerous to the Party's ideology.  Its very nature is to be *un*straightforward, obfuscating meaning and making independent thought difficult. Therefore, it is not considered straightforward.

Answer: {false}
"
1450,Do Snow White dwarves best The Hobbit dwarves in battle?,"This question is subjective and depends heavily on interpretation of ""best"" in a battle context.  There's no canonical answer detailing a direct confrontation.  We need to consider factors like:

* **Numbers:** The Snow White dwarves are seven, while The Hobbit dwarves are thirteen.  This gives The Hobbit dwarves a numerical advantage.
* **Individual Skill:**  While individual skills are not explicitly defined in either story, the Hobbit dwarves undertake a perilous journey, suggesting a higher level of combat readiness and experience.  The Snow White dwarves' skills are largely implied through their mining and defense of their home.
* **Equipment:** The Hobbit dwarves possess significantly better weaponry and armor compared to the implied tools and possibly minimal armor of the Snow White dwarves.
* **Motivation:**  The Hobbit dwarves are fighting for their homeland and treasure, whereas the Snow White dwarves primarily protect their home and themselves from threats like the Evil Queen.

Considering the numerical superiority, better equipment, and potentially greater combat experience of the Hobbit dwarves, they are more likely to win a battle. However, this is a fictional comparison, and a clever strategy by the Snow White dwarves could potentially change the outcome.


Answer: {false}
"
1451,Is Statue of Unity hypothetically more level with Statue of Liberty than Lighthouse of Alexandria?,"The question asks whether the Statue of Unity is more level (meaning closer to being perfectly horizontal) than the Lighthouse of Alexandria.  We need to consider that the Lighthouse of Alexandria no longer exists, and therefore its levelness is unknown and can't be compared. The Statue of Unity, a modern structure, is built with modern engineering, and is likely more level than an ancient structure even if that ancient structure was perfectly level at the time of its construction.  Therefore, the Statue of Unity is *hypothetically* more level than the now-destroyed Lighthouse of Alexandria.  We cannot know the exact levelness of either, but based on the likelihood of modern construction techniques, the Statue of Unity is a more likely candidate for being more level.

1454,Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?,"Adam Sandler's comedic style often involves absurdity and unexpected references.  A Cole Sprouse reference (given Sprouse's acting career, especially his younger years) and a scuba man doll (a random, quirky object) fit within the realm of Sandler's humor.  Therefore, it's plausible that he would incorporate these elements into a joke or scene.

1455,Will Lhamo Thondup be considered by Catholic Church to be a saint?,"Lhamo Thondup, also known as the 14th Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.  The Catholic Church canonizes saints based on a rigorous process involving demonstrating heroic virtue, miracles, and a life lived in accordance with Christian teachings.  Given that the Dalai Lama is the head of a different religious tradition and his life is guided by Buddhist, not Christian, principles, he would not meet the criteria for sainthood in the Catholic Church.

Answer: {false}
"
1456,Can children be hurt by jalapeno peppers?,"Jalapeno peppers contain capsaicin, a chemical compound that produces a burning sensation when it comes into contact with mucous membranes.  Children, especially young children, have more sensitive mucous membranes than adults.  Ingestion of jalapenos can cause mouth, throat, and stomach irritation, leading to discomfort and even pain.  The intensity of the reaction varies depending on the child's age, sensitivity, and the amount of jalapeno consumed.  Therefore, it's possible for children to be hurt by jalapeno peppers.

1459,Would 2020 Toyota Supra lag behind at a Nascar rally?,"NASCAR uses highly modified stock cars, specifically built for stock car racing.  These cars have significantly more horsepower, superior aerodynamics, and racing-specific suspension and chassis components than a production Toyota Supra.  A 2020 Toyota Supra, while a performance car, is not designed for the high speeds, extreme cornering forces, and endurance demands of a NASCAR rally.  Therefore, it would be significantly outmatched and lag behind.

Answer: {true}
"
1460,Can a human eat an entire 12-lb roast turkey in an hour?,"Answer:  The average human stomach can hold roughly 1-1.5 liters, or about 4-6 cups of food.  A 12-lb roast turkey is considerably larger than this volume, even when accounted for digestion during the hour.  The sheer physical act of consuming such a large amount of food in a single hour would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for most people. There would also be significant digestive and physical discomfort.  Therefore, consuming a whole 12-lb roast turkey in one hour is highly improbable for a human.

Answer: {false}
"
1461,Did Zorro carve his name into items regularly?,"Zorro's defining characteristic is his signature ""Z"" carved into items, typically into objects related to his crimes or acts of defiance. This act serves as his calling card and a way to taunt his enemies.  Therefore, it's highly likely he carved his name into things regularly as part of his persona and methods.

"
1468,Was Emperor Commodus paid tribute in Pound sterling?,"Answer: The Roman Empire predates the existence of the British pound sterling.  The British pound sterling originated in the 12th century, while the Roman Empire ended in the 5th century.  Therefore, Emperor Commodus could not have been paid tribute in pounds sterling.

Answer: {false}
"
1469,Should spaghetti be slick when cooked?,"Properly cooked spaghetti should have a slight slickness or slipperiness to it.  This is due to the starch released from the pasta during cooking. This starch creates a coating that prevents the sauce from sticking to the pasta and helps the sauce cling to it evenly.  While overly slick spaghetti might indicate overcooking, a slight slickness is a sign of well-cooked pasta.

Answer: {true}
"
1470,Was the Carnation Revolution the deadliest revolution in Europe?,"The Carnation Revolution, which took place in Portugal in 1974, was a relatively bloodless coup d'état.  While there was some violence and a few deaths, it was not a significantly deadly conflict compared to other revolutions in Europe.  Many European revolutions, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, resulted in significantly higher numbers of casualties. Therefore, the Carnation Revolution cannot be considered the deadliest revolution in Europe.

"
1473,Could you brew beer from start to finish in the month of September?,"Explanation:

Brewing beer involves several stages, each requiring specific timeframes.  These include:

* **Malting:** While you can buy pre-malted barley, the malting process itself takes several weeks.  This is not feasible within a single month.
* **Mashing & Lautering:** This process of converting starches to sugars can be completed within a day.
* **Boiling & Hopping:** The wort is boiled for about an hour with hops. This is also a short process.
* **Fermentation:**  This is the longest stage, typically lasting several weeks, sometimes even months depending on the yeast strain and desired alcohol content.  This alone would exceed a single month.
* **Bottling/Kegging & Conditioning:** This process requires further time for carbonation.

Therefore, even if you started with pre-malted grain and utilized fast-fermenting yeasts, the fermentation time alone would likely exceed the length of September.

1475,Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?,"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that breaks down monoamine neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.  These neurotransmitters are implicated in mood regulation.  Inhibitors of MAO (MAOIs) are used as antidepressants because they increase the levels of these neurotransmitters.  A candy bar containing MAO would have the opposite effect, breaking down these neurotransmitters and potentially worsening depression.  Therefore, it would not cheer up a depressed friend.

1478,Is Europa (moon) name origin related to Amunet?,"Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, is named after a figure from Greek mythology, the Phoenician princess Europa who was abducted by Zeus (in the form of a bull).  Amunet, on the other hand, is an ancient Egyptian goddess associated with invisibility, silence, and the western desert. There's no etymological or mythological connection between the two names.  The naming of celestial bodies often draws from classical mythology, and Europa's name comes firmly from that tradition.

1480,"Will every resident of Los Angeles County, California go to Jehovah Witnesses's heaven?","The Jehovah's Witnesses have a specific set of beliefs about who goes to heaven.  Their theology doesn't suggest that *everyone* goes to heaven, regardless of their beliefs or actions.  In fact, they believe only a select few, those chosen by God, will go to heaven.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that every resident of Los Angeles County, or anywhere else, would meet their criteria for heavenly ascension.

1490,Does meat from cows fed only grass taste more like wild game?,"Grass-fed beef has a leaner profile and different fat composition compared to grain-fed beef.  Grain-fed beef tends to have more marbling and a richer, more buttery flavor.  While grass-fed beef might have a stronger, gamier flavor than grain-fed beef, it doesn't necessarily taste *like* wild game.  Wild game animals have distinct flavors influenced by their diet and lifestyle (e.g., venison's distinctive taste).  While the flavor difference might be noticeable to some as more intense or earthy, it's not a direct equivalence.

Answer: {false}
"
1491,Would King Leonidas have succeeded with an army the size of Mozart's compositions?,"King Leonidas led the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae.  The number of Mozart's compositions is debated, but a commonly cited figure is around 800.  An army of 800 soldiers is far larger than the 300 Spartans. While a larger army might improve chances of success, it's not guaranteed.  Therefore, based purely on numbers, having an army the size of Mozart's compositions would likely give King Leonidas a better chance of success than he had historically at Thermopylae.  However, the success also depends on many other factors like enemy strength, terrain, strategy, and weaponry, which are not specified. Considering purely the numerical advantage, it makes a successful outcome more probable.

1493,Is it best to avoid kola nuts with colitis?,"Kola nuts contain caffeine and theobromine, both of which are stimulants that can act as irritants to the gastrointestinal tract.  Colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation of the colon, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cramping.  Stimulants like those found in kola nuts can exacerbate these symptoms by increasing bowel motility and potentially causing further irritation to the already inflamed colon. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid kola nuts if one has colitis.

1504,Does the Constitution of the Philippines copy text from the British constitution?,"The Philippine Constitution is not based on or derived from the British constitution.  The Philippines has had several constitutions throughout its history, most influenced by American legal traditions following the period of American colonial rule.  The current 1987 Constitution draws heavily from American constitutional principles and structures, not British ones.  While the British system of parliamentary government might have served as a model for some aspects of Philippine governance at certain points in history, direct textual copying from the British constitution is not evident in the Philippine Constitution.

1505,Could all of the famous Apollo's hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's?,"This question requires comparing the fighting abilities of hypothetical groups of ""famous Apollos"" and ""famous D'Artagnas.""  There's no objective way to assess this.  The question is based on fictional characters, and ""famous"" is subjective. We have no way of knowing the relative fighting skills of a group of characters with different origins, different time periods, and different strengths.  Even if we made assumptions about their fighting abilities, there's no established scale or metric for comparison.

"
1508,Are sea turtles enjoying life during quarantine?,"The question asks whether sea turtles enjoyed life during quarantine.  While ""quarantine"" refers to human restrictions due to COVID-19, it's irrelevant to sea turtle life.  Sea turtles' lives are not directly affected by human quarantine measures. Their habitats and behaviors remain largely unchanged.  Therefore, we cannot determine whether they enjoyed their lives any more or less than usual during that period.  The question is unanswerable in a meaningful way.

1511,Would a modern central processing unit circuit chip fit on a housekey?,"A modern CPU circuit chip is incredibly small, but still significantly larger than a house key.  The intricate circuitry and numerous transistors would require a much larger surface area than a typical house key can provide.  The dimensions of a house key are generally in millimeters, whereas the die size of a CPU is measured in square centimeters or even square millimeters depending on the generation.  Even the most compact CPUs would be far too large to fit on a house key.

Answer: {true}
"
1518,Does bull shark bite hurt worse than crocodile bite?,"The severity of a bull shark bite versus a crocodile bite depends on various factors including the size of the animal, the location and force of the bite, and the individual's response.  However, generally, crocodile bites are considered significantly more dangerous and painful than bull shark bites.  Crocodiles possess incredibly powerful jaws and teeth designed for crushing bone, inflicting deep lacerations, and causing significant tissue damage. Bull sharks, while possessing a powerful bite, tend to inflict more tearing and slashing wounds, though still capable of serious injury.  The sheer power and crushing force of a crocodile's bite, along with the potential for infection due to the bacteria in their mouths, makes it likely to be considerably more painful and dangerous than a bull shark bite.

Answer: {false}

1521,Is it possible to get killed walking to the Very Large Telescope?,"The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, a remote and high-altitude area. While the immediate vicinity of the VLT is likely safe and well-maintained, the surrounding desert environment presents various potential hazards.  These include exposure to extreme weather conditions (intense sun, cold nights), altitude sickness, potential encounters with wildlife (although less likely in the immediate vicinity), and the possibility of getting lost. While it's highly unlikely that one would be directly *killed* by the VLT itself or its immediate surroundings, the remote and harsh environment does present a risk of injury or death due to the aforementioned factors.

"
1524,Did mercenaries fight for England in the Glorious Revolution?,"The Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw William of Orange invade England to overthrow King James II. While the main fighting force consisted of the Dutch army under William, and English forces who switched sides,  there's no significant historical evidence to suggest large-scale mercenary involvement.  While individual mercenaries might have been present among the various armies involved, they didn't play a defining role.  The conflict was primarily a struggle between English factions and a foreign intervention, rather than a war reliant on professional mercenaries in the manner of some other conflicts.

1527,Do people of the Iyer caste eat meat?,"The Iyer caste is a Brahmin community primarily found in South India.  Traditional Brahmin practices often involve vegetarianism due to religious and cultural beliefs.  However, dietary practices within any large social group are diverse and evolve over time. While many Iyengar Brahmins are strictly vegetarian, there are likely some individuals within the community who do consume meat, either due to personal preference or changes in traditional norms.  There is no single answer that applies to the entire Iyer community.

Answer: {It is not universally true that people of the Iyer caste do not eat meat.}
"
1528,Would Hades and Osiris hypothetically compete for real estate in the Underworld?,"Hades is the Greek god of the Underworld, while Osiris is the Egyptian god of the Underworld.

1530,Are Chipotle Cinnamon Pork Chops appropriate for a Seder?,"A Seder is a Jewish ritual feast celebrating the exodus of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.  Traditional Seder meals include foods with symbolic significance related to the Passover story, such as matzah (unleavened bread), bitter herbs, and charoset (a sweet paste).  Chipotle cinnamon pork chops are not traditionally part of a Seder and are not symbolically relevant to the Passover story. Pork is also forbidden in Jewish dietary laws (kosher). Therefore, Chipotle cinnamon pork chops would be inappropriate for a Seder.

Answer: {false}
"
1531,Can too many oranges cause diarrhea?,"Explanation:  Consuming excessive amounts of any fruit, including oranges, can lead to diarrhea.  Oranges are high in fructose and sorbitol, which are types of sugar that can be poorly absorbed by the digestive system if consumed in large quantities.  This can result in excess water being drawn into the intestines, leading to loose stools and diarrhea.  Therefore, a very large intake of oranges is likely to cause diarrhea.

Answer: {true}
"
1532,Should someone prone to jealousy be in a polyamorous relationship?,"Jealousy is a strong emotion characterized by insecurity and possessiveness, often stemming from fear of loss or betrayal.  Polyamorous relationships, by their nature, involve multiple romantic partners. This inherently increases the potential for situations that could trigger jealousy, such as seeing one's partner with another person, sharing intimacy, or experiencing perceived unequal distribution of time and attention. While some people in polyamorous relationships successfully manage jealousy, it's a significant challenge that requires considerable emotional maturity, communication skills, and a willingness to work through difficult feelings.  For someone prone to jealousy, entering a polyamorous relationship without addressing the underlying issues could lead to significant relationship conflict, unhappiness, and potential harm to all involved.  It's not impossible, but it significantly increases the likelihood of relationship difficulties.

Answer: {false}
"
1533,Did Christopher Columbus condone multiple deadly sins?,"Christopher Columbus's voyages resulted in the deaths of countless indigenous peoples through violence, disease, and enslavement.  These actions align with interpretations of several deadly sins, including:

* **Murder/Violence:** The intentional killing of indigenous populations through warfare and massacres.
* **Greed/Avarice:**  His primary motivation was the acquisition of wealth and resources for Spain, often at the expense of the native populations.
* **Lust/Envy:** While less directly related, the lust for power and the envy of other European nations' wealth and exploration achievements were driving forces behind his actions.
* **Pride/Vainglory:**  Columbus's actions were often fueled by a sense of self-importance and a belief in his own superiority.  He often underestimated or ignored the indigenous populations he encountered.

Therefore, based on historical accounts and interpretations of the seven deadly sins, it is reasonable to conclude that Columbus's actions could be considered to have condoned or reflected several deadly sins.

Answer: {true}
"
1534,Did the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hurt the stocks of robotics companies?,"Explanation: The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was a major stock market crash that occurred in the United States.  Robotics, as a field, was in its very early stages in the 1920s. While there may have been some nascent companies involved in early automation or related technologies, the impact of the crash on these companies, if any, would have been minimal compared to the overall devastation on established industries.  The technology wasn't developed enough to be a significant sector of the stock market.

Answer: {false}
"
1535,Could Christopher Nolan's movies finance Cyprus's entire GDP?,"Here's an explanation to determine if Christopher Nolan's movies could finance Cyprus's entire GDP:

First, we need to estimate the total box office revenue of Christopher Nolan's films.  This is difficult to pinpoint precisely without extensive research across all territories and revenue streams (including home video sales, streaming, etc.).  However, we can make a reasonable approximation.  His major films have been significant box office successes, grossing hundreds of millions of dollars each.

Second, we need to find the GDP of Cyprus.  This information is readily available from sources like the World Bank or IMF.  The GDP will be in a specific currency (likely Euros).

Third, we need to convert the box office revenue (likely in US dollars) to the same currency as Cyprus's GDP (Euros) using the appropriate exchange rate.

Finally, we compare the total box office revenue of all Christopher Nolan films (in Euros) to Cyprus's GDP (in Euros).  If the box office revenue is greater than or equal to Cyprus's GDP, then the answer is true; otherwise, it is false.  Given the high budget and global popularity of Nolan's films, it is unlikely to reach the levels of a relatively small country's GDP.  This requires detailed financial analysis beyond the scope of a simple question/answer format.  Without conducting the detailed research across all of Nolan's films, box office numbers and currency conversions we can only make an educated guess.

Answer: {false}

1539,Were Greeks essential to crafting Egyptian Lighthouse of Alexandria?,"The Lighthouse of Alexandria was built in Alexandria, Egypt, during the Hellenistic period, a time when Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Greek dynasty.  While the exact details of the construction are not completely clear, the architectural design and engineering expertise involved strongly suggest significant Greek influence and participation.  The Ptolemaic dynasty fostered Greek culture and language, and Greek architects and engineers were likely crucial to such a monumental project.

Answer: {true}
"
1540,Does the judo rank system reach the triple digits?,"The judo rank system uses a system of kyu (beginner ranks) and dan (advanced ranks).  Kyu ranks are numbered downwards from 6th kyu to 1st kyu. Dan ranks are numbered upwards from 1st dan.  While there is no theoretical upper limit to the dan ranks, in practice, the highest dan ranks are extremely rare. While there are some organizations that may award ranks beyond 10th dan, it's not a universally recognized or common practice.   Therefore, while technically a theoretically possible scenario, reaching triple digits (e.g. 100th dan) is not a realistic part of the standard judo ranking system.

Answer: {false}
"
1541,Is cactus fruit an important menu item for a restaurant based on Cuauhtémoc?,"Cuauhtémoc was the last Aztec emperor.  Aztec cuisine heavily featured ingredients native to the region, such as maize, beans, squash, and various chiles.  While cacti are native to the region and were used by the Aztecs (nopales, the pads, are a common ingredient), cactus fruit (like prickly pear) is less prominently featured in traditional Aztec dishes than other ingredients.  While a restaurant based on Cuauhtémoc might incorporate some cactus fruit in its menu, it's unlikely to be a *major* or *important* menu item in the way corn or beans would be.

"
1544,Is viscosity unimportant in making jello shots?,"Jello shots rely on the gelatin setting to create a solid, jiggly consistency.  Viscosity, which is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow, is directly related to how well the gelatin sets.  A higher viscosity (thicker liquid) means the gelatin will set more effectively and result in a firmer jello shot.  A lower viscosity (thinner liquid) could result in a runnier, less solid, and less desirable product.  Therefore, viscosity is important in making jello shots.

Answer: {false}

1546,Could a markhor give birth three times in a single year?,"Markhor are a species of wild goat.  Gestation for markhor is approximately 150-160 days.  This means that a single pregnancy lasts roughly 5-5.3 months.  It is biologically impossible for a female markhor to give birth three times in a single year because the gestation period alone prevents it.  Even if a female were to conceive immediately after giving birth, it wouldn't be possible to complete three pregnancies within a 365-day period.

1552,Could someone theoretically use an armadillo as a shield?,"An armadillo's shell is made of bony scutes, which offer a degree of protection.  While not impenetrable, it could potentially deflect some projectiles or impacts, offering a minimal level of shielding.  However, the effectiveness would depend heavily on the type and force of the threat, and an armadillo is not a practical or reliable shield.  An armadillo's size and the nature of its shell would make it a flimsy and cumbersome shield, unlikely to provide significant protection against most threats.

1. **Find the population of Gothenburg:** A quick online search reveals that Gothenburg, Sweden, has a population of roughly 580,000 people.

2. **Calculate a tenth of Gothenburg's population:**  (580,000 / 10) = 58,000 people

3. **Find the seating capacity of Toyota Stadium:** Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, has a seating capacity of approximately 20,500 people.

4. **Compare the two numbers:** Toyota Stadium's capacity (20,500) is less than a tenth of Gothenburg's population (58,000).

1558,Could a Jujutsu expert hypothetically defeat a Janissary?,"A Jujutsu expert is trained in a grappling-based martial art focusing on throws, joint locks, and control.  Janissaries were elite Ottoman infantry known for their discipline, weaponry (primarily firearms and scimitars), and battlefield tactics.  While a Janissary's firearm would give him a significant advantage at range,  in close-quarters combat, a skilled Jujutsu expert could potentially overcome the Janissary.  Jujutsu's emphasis on grappling and disabling techniques could allow the expert to close the distance, disarm the Janissary, and use his superior grappling skills to subdue or incapacitate him. The outcome would depend heavily on the specific skills and experience of both combatants, the environment, and whether the Janissary has the opportunity to use his firearm effectively.  However, it is certainly plausible that a highly skilled Jujutsu expert could win such a confrontation.

1561,Are pirate lieutenants like navy lieutenants?,"Naval lieutenants and pirate lieutenants share a similar rank structure in that both are subordinate officers. However, the context, responsibilities, and legal standing differ significantly.  A navy lieutenant is a commissioned officer within a formal, legally recognized military structure, bound by a code of conduct and laws of naval warfare.  A pirate lieutenant, on the other hand, was an officer within a largely lawless organization, with responsibilities varying depending on the pirate captain and the specific crew.  While both might command a portion of a crew, the legal and organizational contexts are vastly different.  Therefore, they are not alike.

1563,"If your electric stove has a glass top, should you use cast iron skillets?","Cast iron skillets are extremely heavy.  Dropping a heavy cast iron skillet onto a glass stovetop could easily crack or shatter the glass.  While you *can* technically use cast iron on a glass top stove, the risk of damage far outweighs the benefit.  It's much safer to use lighter cookware on a glass top stove.

"
1564,Will Conan the Barbarian hypothetically last a short time inside of Call of Duty?,"Explanation:

Conan the Barbarian is a fictional character known for his exceptional strength, fighting skills, and resilience.  However, Call of Duty is a video game featuring modern weaponry and fast-paced combat.  While Conan's physical abilities might give him a slight advantage in close-quarters combat, the overwhelming firepower, advanced weaponry, and tactical maneuvers available to Call of Duty players would likely quickly overwhelm him.  His lack of modern combat experience and training would also be a significant detriment.  Therefore, it's highly probable that Conan would not survive long in a Call of Duty scenario.

Answer: {true}

"
1568,Is Supreme Court of the United States analogous to High Courts of Justice of Spain?,"The Supreme Court of the United States and the High Courts of Justice of Spain are both highest courts in their respective countries.  They both have the power of judicial review, meaning they can examine laws passed by the legislature and determine their constitutionality.  However, there are key differences. The Spanish system has a more complex structure with multiple High Courts of Justice, one for each autonomous community, in addition to a national Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo). The US Supreme Court is the single highest court.  Further, the specific powers and jurisdictions of each court may differ based on the respective national constitutions and legal systems. While both serve a similar function as supreme judicial bodies, their organizational structures and precise powers are not entirely analogous.

1572,Would Lee Sedol understand the complexities of the Sicilian Defence?,"Lee Sedol is a world champion Go player.  The Sicilian Defence is a complex opening in chess.  Go and chess are distinct games requiring different strategic thinking and skill sets. While a highly intelligent individual like Lee Sedol might be capable of learning the Sicilian Defence, it's not a given that he would inherently understand its complexities without specific study.  His expertise in Go doesn't translate directly to chess expertise.

1573,Are Citizens of Bern Switzerland are descendants of Genghis Khan?,"Answer: There is no evidence linking the citizens of Bern, Switzerland to Genghis Khan or his descendants.  Genetic studies of populations would be necessary to establish any such connection, and no such studies suggest a link between the Swiss population of Bern and the Mongol Empire.  While Genghis Khan's empire was vast, its influence doesn't extend to a direct genetic lineage with the modern population of Bern.

"
1577,Are there some countries where waiting staff need no tip?,"Many cultures have different norms regarding tipping.  In some countries, service charges are included in the bill, making tipping unnecessary or even considered rude. In others, wages for service staff are higher, making tips less essential for their livelihood.  Several European countries, for example, often include service charges in the bill, while in Japan, tipping is generally not expected or even accepted. This is in contrast to the United States and Canada, where tipping is a significant part of the service industry compensation system.  Therefore, the answer is yes, there are countries where waiting staff don't need tips.

"
1584,Can a rabbi save the soul of a Christian?,"The question asks whether a rabbi can save the soul of a Christian.  This hinges on differing theological viewpoints.  

* **Christianity:**  Most Christian denominations believe salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ.  A rabbi, operating within a Jewish theological framework, wouldn't generally be considered capable of performing a specifically Christian act of salvation.

* **Judaism:** Judaism doesn't typically operate with the same concept of ""saving souls"" as Christianity.  While a rabbi might offer spiritual guidance and comfort to anyone, regardless of their faith, the Christian understanding of salvation wouldn't be a part of that interaction.


Therefore, based on the prevailing theological understanding of both faiths, the answer is no.

Answer: {false}
"
1585,Will a person survive a fever of NY's highest recorded temperature?,"Explanation:
New York City's highest recorded temperature is 106°F (41°C).  A fever of 106°F is extremely high and life-threatening.  While some individuals might temporarily reach such a high temperature during a severe illness, sustained temperatures at that level are extremely dangerous and likely fatal.  Therefore, surviving a fever at that exact temperature is highly improbable.

Answer: {false}
"
1586,Are Mayors safe from harm from the federal government?,"Mayors are local government officials.  The federal government has no inherent power to harm mayors simply for being mayors. However, mayors are subject to federal laws like anyone else and could face legal consequences if they break those laws.  Furthermore, while unlikely, a federal agency could theoretically investigate a mayor for wrongdoing, which could indirectly lead to harm (reputationally or professionally), but this would not be a direct act of harm from the federal government *because* they are a mayor.


Answer: {false}
"
1587,Did the Nepalese Civil War take place near India?,"The Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006) was fought entirely within the borders of Nepal.  Nepal shares a long border with India, but the war itself did not spill over into Indian territory.  Therefore, while geographically close to India, the war did not take place *near* India in the sense of being fought on or across the border.

"
1590,Could largest asteroid crush a whole city?,"Explanation:
The size of asteroids varies greatly.  While many are small, some are extremely large.  The largest asteroids could potentially cause catastrophic damage on a city-wide or even continental scale if they impacted Earth. The energy released upon impact would be immense, creating a massive crater, shockwaves, and potentially triggering earthquakes, tsunamis, and widespread fires. The resulting debris cloud could block sunlight and cause a global climate change.  Therefore, a sufficiently large asteroid could indeed crush a whole city, and much more.

Answer: {true}
"
1591,Walt Disney dominated his amusement park peers at Academy Awards?,"Walt Disney and his company, The Walt Disney Company, have won numerous Academy Awards, including Oscars for animated films and other achievements in filmmaking.  However, this question is about his dominance *over his amusement park peers* at the Academy Awards.  This is a comparison that isn't directly relevant to the Oscars.  Amusement park companies don't typically compete in the Oscars in the same way that film studios do.  While Disney's films have won many Oscars, the question is misconstrued.  There's no context or metric for comparing Disney's Oscar wins against his ""amusement park peers"" at the Academy Awards.

Answer: {false}
"
1594,Can a martyr saint have been excommunicated?,"A martyr saint, by definition, is someone who died for their faith.  Excommunication is the formal exclusion of a person from the religious community.  While it's theoretically possible for someone to be excommunicated *before* becoming a martyr (perhaps for beliefs that later led to their martyrdom), the act of martyrdom itself typically involves a significant demonstration of faith and commitment to the religious community.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely a person would remain excommunicated after being declared a martyr saint.  The process of canonization (becoming a saint) often involves reviewing and re-evaluating the individual's life and actions, likely overturning any previous excommunication.

Answer: {false}
"
1595,"In order to work in district management, does one need a car?","District management often involves travel between different locations within a district.  While public transportation might be an option in some areas, it's often impractical or impossible to rely solely on it for efficient district management.  A car provides much greater flexibility and allows for timely visits to various sites and meetings with individuals across the district.  Therefore, having a car is typically considered a significant advantage, if not a necessity, for effective district management.

Answer: {true}
"
1596,Can nitric acid break the Louvre?,"Nitric acid is a highly corrosive acid.  While it wouldn't ""break"" the Louvre in the sense of causing a sudden collapse, its corrosive properties could severely damage the building's stonework, sculptures, and artwork over time.  The Louvre is made of various materials, many of which would be susceptible to chemical attack by nitric acid.  Even a small amount of nitric acid exposure could cause significant, irreparable damage to priceless artifacts and the building's structure.

"
1598,Did Jackie Kennedy wear Dolce & Gabbana to her husband's inauguration?,"Jackie Kennedy Onassis's iconic inaugural gown was designed by Ann Lowe, a highly talented African-American designer.  Dolce & Gabbana is a significantly later fashion house, not established until many years after President Kennedy's inauguration.  Therefore, it's impossible for her to have worn Dolce & Gabbana to the event.

Answer: {false}
"
1599,Would it be hard to get toilet paper if there were no loggers?,"Explanation: Toilet paper is made from wood pulp.  Loggers are responsible for harvesting trees, which are the source of the wood used to make wood pulp.

"
1600,Could Arnold Schwarzenegger hypothetically defeat Hafþór Björnsson in a powerlifting competition if both are at their peak strength?,"Explanation:

This question requires comparing the peak powerlifting abilities of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Hafþór Björnsson.  While Schwarzenegger was a highly successful bodybuilder and strongman, Björnsson is a professional strongman known for his exceptional strength, holding several world records in strongman events.  Björnsson's specialization and size advantage would likely make him the more competitive powerlifter. While Schwarzenegger was incredibly strong for his time, it is unlikely he would surpass Björnsson's peak powerlifting capabilities.

Answer: {false}
"
1601,Would the number 666 appear in a church?,"The number 666 is associated with the biblical ""number of the beast"" in the Book of Revelation. While some churches might use this number in a theological discussion about the Antichrist or as a symbolic representation of evil, its prominent display or use is unlikely. Many churches would avoid displaying the number 666 to prevent causing offense or misunderstanding among their congregation.  However, it's possible the number might appear incidentally as part of a date, a page number, or other non-symbolic context within a church.

Answer: {false}
"
1602,"Could Elizabeth I of England have seen the play Dido, Queen of Carthage ?","Explanation:
The play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" by Christopher Marlowe was first performed sometime between 1580 and 1590.  Elizabeth I reigned as Queen of England from 1558 to 1603.  Therefore, she was alive during the period when the play was likely first performed, making it plausible she could have seen a performance.

"
1604,Does giant panda have colors that differ from yin yang?,"The yin and yang symbol consists of black and white.  Giant pandas are primarily black and white.  However, while the colors are similar, the *patterns* are vastly different.  Yin and yang is a specific circular design with a swirl, while a panda's coloration is in distinct patches across its body.  Therefore, while they share some colors, they are not the same.

Answer: {true}
"
1606,Would Modafinil be effective in completing a suicide?,"Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent, not a substance typically associated with causing death by overdose.  While there are potential side effects, such as anxiety, insomnia, and in rare cases, seizures,  it's not considered a lethal substance in the way that, for example, opioids or barbiturates are.  Overdoses of modafinil are generally not fatal. Therefore, it would be unlikely to be effective in completing a suicide.

Answer: {false}
"
1607,Is it unusual to eat spaghetti without a fork?,"Eating spaghetti without a fork is unusual in many cultures, especially Western cultures where the fork is the primary utensil for eating pasta. While some might use a spoon to help twirl the spaghetti onto the fork, completely forgoing the fork and employing alternative methods like chopsticks or even hands (though messy) is less common and would generally be considered unusual.

Answer: {true}
"
1608,Would Arnold Schwarzenegger be unable to run for President of the US?,"Answer: Arnold Schwarzenegger was born in Austria.  The U.S. Constitution requires that the President be a natural-born citizen.  Therefore, he would be ineligible to run for President of the United States.

Answer: {true}
"
1609,Can atheism surpass Christianity in American black communities by 2021?,"The question asks whether atheism could surpass Christianity as the dominant religion in American Black communities by 2021.  This requires considering several factors:

* **Current religious landscape:**  Historically, Christianity has been the dominant religion in the Black American community.  Precise figures on atheism within this demographic are harder to come by compared to broader national surveys.
* **Trends in religious affiliation:** There's a general trend in the US (across all demographics) towards less religious affiliation, including a rise in those identifying as atheist, agnostic, or ""nothing in particular.""  Whether this trend is significantly impacting the Black community at the same rate requires specific data.
* **Timescale:** The timeframe, 2021, is relatively short.  Significant shifts in religious affiliation typically take longer to manifest.

Without access to precise demographic data on religious affiliation among Black Americans for 2021,  it's highly improbable that atheism would have surpassed Christianity in such a short period, given the long-standing dominance of Christianity.  While there might have been a slight increase in non-religious identification, a complete reversal of religious dominance is unlikely within that timeframe.

1610,Does Steven Spielberg's 1998 film take place in a period after War Horse setting?,"Steven Spielberg's 1998 film, *Saving Private Ryan*, is set during the Normandy landings in June 1944.  *War Horse*, on the other hand, is set during World War I.  World War I ended in 1918, meaning *Saving Private Ryan* takes place considerably later than *War Horse*.

Answer: {true}
"
1611,Is Autumn a good time to collect bear pelts in US?,"Answer: Black bears in the US enter their denning phase in late autumn and winter.  Trapping and hunting of bears is often regulated by state laws and may be restricted or even prohibited during this time to protect the animals during their hibernation period.  Therefore, while it might be *possible* to collect bear pelts in autumn, it's not generally a good or legal time to do so in many parts of the US.

Answer: {false}
"
1612,Could Rich and Morty be triggered for children of alcoholics?,"The show Rick and Morty contains mature themes, including dysfunctional family relationships and alcoholism.  The portrayal of alcoholic behavior, particularly Rick's heavy drinking and erratic behavior, could be triggering for children of alcoholics.  The show doesn't explicitly focus on the impact of alcoholism on children, but the depiction of the dysfunctional dynamic and Rick's actions as a result of his alcoholism could resonate negatively with viewers who have experienced similar situations in their own lives. The dark humor and often bleak storylines might also exacerbate any pre-existing trauma.

Answer: {true}
"
1613,Do American wheelchair users know what the ADA is?,"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that prohibits discrimination based on disability.  It affects numerous areas of life, including employment, public services, transportation, and telecommunications.  Given the ADA's significance and wide-ranging impact, it's highly probable that most, if not all, American wheelchair users are aware of its existence and its relevance to their lives. While complete awareness of every aspect of the ADA might vary, basic knowledge of the law and its protections is likely widespread among this population.

Answer: {true}
"
1614,Is it difficult to conduct astrophotography in the summer in Sweden?,"Sweden experiences midnight sun during the summer months in its northern regions.  This means there is minimal darkness, making it very difficult to conduct astrophotography which requires long exposure times in darkness to capture faint celestial objects.  Even in southern Sweden, the shorter nights and extended twilight periods will significantly reduce the amount of suitable dark time for astrophotography.

1615,Did Jane Austen suffer from middle child syndrome?,"Jane Austen was the second of six children.  While there's no clinical evidence or documentation suggesting she suffered from middle child syndrome, the condition itself isn't definitively diagnosable and relies on anecdotal observations of behavioral patterns.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether she experienced it or not.  The question relies on speculation and lacks verifiable information.

Answer: {false}
"
1616,Would Gomer Pyle salute a lieutenant?,"Gomer Pyle, a character known for his endearing but often confused nature, would generally salute a lieutenant.  Military protocol dictates saluting officers of higher rank, and a lieutenant is a commissioned officer of higher rank than a private like Gomer Pyle.

Answer: {true}
"
1617,Can Herpes simplex virus spread on Venus?,"Herpes simplex virus is a virus that infects humans and other primates.  It requires a host organism with specific cellular mechanisms to replicate and spread.  Venus lacks any known life forms, and its surface conditions are extremely hostile (extreme heat, crushing atmospheric pressure, and a highly corrosive atmosphere). Therefore, the Herpes simplex virus, lacking a suitable host and a survivable environment, could not spread on Venus.

Answer: {false}
"
1618,Is Pig Latin related to real Latin?,"Pig Latin is a language game, not a real language or a dialect of Latin.  It involves altering words according to a set of rules, usually by moving the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and adding ""-ay.""  There is no historical or linguistic connection between Pig Latin and the classical language of Latin.

1620,"During the pandemic, is door to door advertising considered inconsiderate?","Explanation: During the pandemic, many health organizations recommended social distancing and limiting close contact with others to prevent the spread of the virus.  Door-to-door advertising inherently involves close contact between the advertiser and residents, potentially increasing the risk of transmission.  This disregard for public health guidelines during a time of heightened vulnerability would likely be considered inconsiderate by many people.

Answer: {true}
"
1621,Did Ivan the Terrible use the Byzantine calendar?,"Ivan the Terrible ruled from 1533 to 1584.  The Byzantine Empire fell in 1453. While the Byzantine calendar continued to be used in some areas after the fall of the empire,  it's highly unlikely it was the primary calendar in use in Russia during Ivan's reign. Russia at that time was transitioning to the Julian calendar.  Therefore, it's improbable Ivan the Terrible used the Byzantine calendar as his primary means of reckoning time.

Answer: {false}
"
1622,Could a delicious recipe be made with The Onion?,"The Onion is a satirical news website, not a culinary ingredient in the traditional sense.  While one could *theoretically* incorporate elements from articles or headlines *about* food into a creative writing piece describing a recipe, there's no actual food item called ""The Onion"" that can be used in cooking.  Therefore, a delicious recipe cannot be made using ""The Onion"" as an ingredient.

Answer: {false}
"
1623,Does The Doctor keep his ship in his childhood home?,"The question asks whether The Doctor (from Doctor Who) keeps his TARDIS in his childhood home.  The Doctor's TARDIS is a time machine disguised as a police box.  The TARDIS is not located in a fixed place, and there is no established canon suggesting The Doctor keeps his time machine in his childhood home.  The Doctor travels through time and space, so keeping such a large, time-traveling vehicle in a childhood home would be both impractical and contrary to the established narrative.

Answer: {false}
"
1624,Did Francois Mitterrand ever meet Barak Obama while they both held the position of President?,"François Mitterrand was the President of France from 1981 to 1995.  Barack Obama was the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.  Their presidencies overlapped for several years (2009-1995). However, there's no widely available information suggesting a meeting between them.  While it's possible a private meeting occurred without public record, the absence of any readily accessible evidence makes it highly unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
1625,Did Neanderthals use arithmetic?,"There's no definitive evidence that Neanderthals used arithmetic in the way we understand it.  While they demonstrated advanced cognitive abilities, including toolmaking and potentially symbolic thought, there's no archaeological evidence of systems of counting, numerical notation, or the manipulation of numbers for calculations.  Their cognitive capabilities might have involved an understanding of quantities or amounts, but not necessarily formal arithmetic.

Answer: {false}
"
1626,Is coal needed to practice parachuting?,"Coal is a fuel source used for generating electricity and powering various industrial processes.  It has no direct role or use in parachuting.  Parachuting relies on gravity, air resistance, and the design of the parachute itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1627,Is a watchmaker likely to be able to fix an Apple Watch?,"A watchmaker's expertise lies in traditional mechanical watches, which have fundamentally different mechanisms than smartwatches like the Apple Watch. While a skilled watchmaker might possess some transferable skills related to precision mechanics and miniaturization,  Apple Watches use complex integrated circuits, software, and other components that require specialized knowledge and tools far beyond the typical scope of a traditional watchmaker's training and equipment.  Therefore, it's unlikely a watchmaker could effectively repair an Apple Watch.

Answer: {false}

1630,Would Jacques Duèze have been friends with Richard Dawkins?,"Jacques Duèze is a fictional character from the French comic strip ""Gaston Lagaffe,"" known for his clumsiness and lack of scientific knowledge. Richard Dawkins is a prominent evolutionary biologist and outspoken atheist known for his rigorous scientific approach and popular science writing.  Their personalities, fields of expertise, and likely social circles are vastly different, making friendship highly improbable.

Answer: {false}
"
1631,Can spiders help eggplant farmers control parasites?,"Some spiders are predators of insects and other arthropods that can be pests to eggplant crops.  Therefore, introducing beneficial spiders into an eggplant field could potentially reduce the need for chemical pesticides and help control parasite populations.  This is a common practice in integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.

Answer: {true}
"
1632,Does butter industry survive cow extinction?,"Answer: The butter industry relies entirely on cows for milk, which is a necessary ingredient in butter production.  If cows became extinct, there would be no milk, and therefore no butter production.  Therefore, the butter industry would not survive.

Answer: {false}
"
1633,Could a chipmunk fit 100 chocolate chips in his mouth?,"Answer: A chipmunk's mouth is relatively small.  While a chipmunk can store a significant number of food items in its cheek pouches, it's highly unlikely that 100 chocolate chips, even small ones, could physically fit inside its mouth at once.  The size and shape of the chocolate chips would also significantly affect this.

Answer: {false}
"
1634,Could all of the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day fit in Dorton Arena?,"To determine if all the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day could fit in Dorton Arena, we need to estimate the daily ridership of 30th Street Station and the seating capacity of Dorton Arena.

* **30th Street Station Daily Ridership:**  30th Street Station is a major transportation hub.  While precise daily ridership numbers fluctuate, it's safe to assume tens of thousands of people pass through the station daily. Let's conservatively estimate this number at 50,000 for this exercise.

* **Dorton Arena Seating Capacity:** Dorton Arena's seating capacity varies depending on the event configuration. A reasonable estimate for its maximum capacity is around 10,000-12,000 people.  Let's use 12,000 for this calculation.

Comparison:  The estimated daily ridership of 30th Street Station (50,000) is significantly larger than the seating capacity of Dorton Arena (12,000).

Answer: {false}
"
1635,Is basil safe from Hypervitaminosis D?,"Hypervitaminosis D, or vitamin D toxicity, is caused by excessive intake of vitamin D.  Basil, a culinary herb, does not contain vitamin D in significant amounts. Therefore, it is not susceptible to or affected by hypervitaminosis D.

"
1638,Is the most expensive color in the world Blue?,"The question asks if blue is the most expensive color in the world.  There's no definitive ""most expensive color"" as cost depends on many factors like the rarity of the pigment, the process of creation, and market demand. While some blue pigments, like ultramarine made from lapis lazuli, have historically been very expensive,  it's not a universally accepted fact that blue is *the* most expensive color overall.  Other colors, depending on the specific pigment and its source, could potentially be even more costly.

Answer: {false}
"
1639,Was The Canterbury Tales written before One Thousand and One Nights?,"The Canterbury Tales was written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century (approximately 1387-1400).  One Thousand and One Nights (also known as Arabian Nights) is a collection of stories with a long and complex history, but its core stories date back to the 8th century or earlier, with many additions and revisions throughout the centuries.  Therefore, One Thousand and One Nights predates The Canterbury Tales.

Answer: {false}
"
1640,Is immersion in virtual reality testable on cnidarians before humans?,"Cnidarians, like jellyfish and sea anemones, have a relatively simple nervous system compared to humans.  While they can react to stimuli in their environment, their capacity for experiencing or processing information in a way that would allow for a meaningful test of virtual reality immersion is extremely limited, if it exists at all.  Virtual reality relies on complex sensory perception and cognitive processing that cnidarians lack.  Therefore, testing VR immersion on cnidarians is not feasible or relevant to human VR experiences.

Answer: {false}
"
1641,Could Little Women have been a book read by veterans of the civil war?,"Little Women was published in 1868 and 1869.  The American Civil War ended in 1865. Therefore, veterans of the Civil War would have been alive and could have potentially read the book after its publication.

Answer: {true}
"
1642,Will a sloth explode if it's not upside down?,"Sloths are known for their slow movements and for often hanging upside down from tree branches.  However, there is no biological mechanism that would cause a sloth to explode if it were not upside down.  Their physiology does not involve any pressure build-up or instability related to their orientation.  They are simply more comfortable and efficient at moving while upside down, due to their body structure and the way they navigate their arboreal environment.

Answer: {false}
"
1643,Would a birdwatcher pursue their hobby at a Philadelphia Eagles game?,"A birdwatcher's hobby centers around observing birds in their natural habitats or other locations where birds are present.  While a stadium like the one where the Philadelphia Eagles play might have some birds nearby, it is not a typical location for birdwatching. The primary focus of a person attending an Eagles game is the game itself, not bird watching.  The environment – the noise, the crowds, and the lack of natural habitats – would make it a very poor location for birdwatching.

Answer: {false}
"
1644,Would a fungal life-form be threatened by a pigment from copper?,"Copper is a heavy metal, and heavy metals are generally toxic to fungi.  Copper-based fungicides are commonly used in agriculture and other applications precisely because of their toxicity to fungal life forms.  The pigment itself might not be the only toxic element, but the presence of copper in a pigment would likely pose a threat.

Answer: {true}
"
1645,Does the land in close proximity to beaver dams suffer?,"Beaver dams alter the flow of water, leading to flooding in some areas and altering the water table.  This can negatively impact the surrounding vegetation and soil stability.  The increased water levels can drown trees and other plants, changing the local ecosystem.  While beaver activity creates habitat for some species, the changes in water levels and soil conditions can harm other plants and animals. Therefore, the land near beaver dams does experience negative consequences.

Answer: {true}
"
1646,Could Quartz be useful to humans if plants died off and there was no oxygen?,"Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2).  It's a mineral, not a source of oxygen.  Plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, a process that uses sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.  If plants died off, the oxygen production would cease, and there wouldn't be a replacement source like quartz.  Quartz itself wouldn't be useful for survival in a scenario lacking oxygen.

Answer: {false}
"
1647,Is the Illuminati card game still popular?,"The Illuminati card game, originally published in 1982,  had a period of significant popularity, particularly surrounding its release and in the years following.  However, its current popularity is difficult to definitively quantify without precise sales figures or active player data. While it remains available for purchase and has a dedicated following,  its widespread popularity has likely diminished compared to its peak.  It's more likely to be found among niche groups of strategy game enthusiasts or those interested in its conspiracy theory-related themes than to be a mainstream popular game.

Answer: {false}

"
1649,Was the Parc des Princes fully operational during June of 2020?,"Answer: The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread lockdowns and restrictions on public gatherings globally in 2020.  This would almost certainly have included the closure of the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, France, for large-scale events like football matches.  While some limited activities might have been permitted, full operational capacity for a stadium of its size would have been unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
1650,Will Chick-fil-A hypothetically refuse to sponsor a Pride parade?,"Chick-fil-A has a history of donating to organizations that oppose same-sex marriage.  Their public image and stated values align with a conservative stance on social issues.  Pride parades are celebrations of LGBTQ+ pride and are often associated with causes that oppose Chick-fil-A's previously demonstrated values.  Therefore, it is highly likely that Chick-fil-A would refuse to sponsor a Pride parade.

Answer: {false}
"
1653,Did Larry King sign the Magna Carta?,"Explanation: The Magna Carta was signed in 1215. Larry King was a 20th and 21st-century television and radio personality.  Therefore, Larry King could not have signed the Magna Carta.

Answer: {false}
"
1654,Is Phobos (moon) name origin similar to Roman god Pavor?,"Phobos, one of Mars' moons, is named after the Greek god of fear, Phobos.  Pavor is the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Phobos. While they represent the same concept of fear, they are distinct figures from different pantheons.  Their names share a common root in the concept of fear but are not the same name.  Therefore, while there is a conceptual similarity, the names themselves are not the same and their origins are not identical.

Answer: {false}
"
1655,Would a snake have reasons to fear a honey badger?,"Honey badgers are known for their ferocity, aggression, and thick skin, making them formidable predators.  They are fearless and will attack animals much larger than themselves, including venomous snakes.  Snakes, even venomous ones, are vulnerable to a honey badger's powerful jaws and claws.  Therefore, a snake would have good reason to fear a honey badger.

Answer: {true}
"
1656,Are honey badgers and hyenas anatomically dissimilar?,"Honey badgers and hyenas, while both formidable predators, belong to different families and possess distinct anatomical features.  Honey badgers (Mustelidae family) are smaller, more elongated animals with longer, more slender bodies.  They have relatively short legs and powerful claws adapted for digging. Hyenas (Hyaenidae family) are larger, with a more robust build and powerful jaws designed for crushing bones. Their forequarters are heavier than their hindquarters, and they have relatively long legs.  Their teeth and skull structure are also markedly different, reflecting their distinct dietary adaptations.  Therefore, significant anatomical differences exist between these two carnivores.

Answer: {true}
"
1657,Was Noah concerned with buoyancy?,"Noah's Ark, as described in the Bible, needed to float to accomplish its purpose of saving animals from a great flood.  Floating is directly related to buoyancy – the ability of an object to float in a liquid.  Therefore, Noah would have needed to be concerned with the buoyancy of his Ark.

Answer: {true}
"
1658,Is the Muslim world hostile to Israel?,"Answer: {The relationship between the Muslim world and Israel is complex and varies significantly across different countries and groups. While some Muslim-majority nations have normalized relations with Israel, others maintain a hostile stance, often rooted in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and historical grievances.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to characterize the entire Muslim world as uniformly hostile to Israel.}
"
1659,Did Kim Il-sung network on LinkedIn?,"Explanation: LinkedIn is a professional networking site that was founded in December 2002. Kim Il-sung died in 1994.  Therefore, it would be impossible for him to have had a LinkedIn account.

"
1660,Was ethanol beneficial to Jack Kerouac's health?,"Jack Kerouac's heavy alcohol consumption is well-documented, and alcohol is certainly not beneficial to health.  While ethanol is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, it's not presented in a context suggesting health benefits within the context of Jack Kerouac's life. His writings and biographies portray a lifestyle heavily influenced by alcohol, contributing to health problems. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that ethanol was beneficial to his health.

Answer: {false}
"
1661,Could the Jackson 5 play a full game of rugby with each other?,"The Jackson 5 consisted of five brothers: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael.  A full rugby team requires more than five players.  Therefore, the Jackson 5 could not play a full game of rugby with only themselves.

Answer: {false}
"
1662,Does the human stomach destroy a bee if ingested?,"The human stomach is a highly acidic environment, with a pH typically ranging from 1.5 to 3.5.  This acidity is crucial for breaking down food and killing many ingested microorganisms.  A bee's exoskeleton offers some protection, but the stomach's acids and digestive enzymes are powerful enough to eventually break down the bee's body.  While the bee's stinger might cause some irritation initially, the stomach's environment is ultimately hostile to the bee's survival.

Answer: {true}
"
1663,Would Elon Musk be more likely to know about astrology than physics?,"Elon Musk is known for his involvement in fields like engineering, technology, and space exploration, all of which heavily rely on physics and related sciences. While there's no evidence suggesting he actively engages with or promotes astrology, his expertise and background strongly suggest physics would be far more familiar to him.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that he would know more about astrology than physics.

Answer: {false}
"
1664,Does Coast to Coast AM have more longevity than the Rush Limbaugh show?,"Coast to Coast AM premiered in 1988 and is still running.  Rush Limbaugh's show ran from 1988 to 2020.  Therefore, Coast to Coast AM has had a longer run.

"
1667,Should wool be hand washed only?,"Many types of wool can be machine washed, especially if they are superwash treated.  However, hand washing is generally recommended for finer wools to prevent shrinking and damage.  Therefore, while some wool *can* be machine washed, it's not universally true that wool *should only* be hand washed.

Answer: {false}
"
1668,Do most people only memorize slightly over half of their ZIP code?,"The average ZIP code in the United States has five digits.  Most people don't actively memorize the entire ZIP code, but rather remember the first few digits (usually the first three) which often correspond to a general area. The last two digits typically represent a more specific area within that broader region. Therefore, it's plausible that most people only memorize slightly more than half, or around three digits, of their ZIP code.

Answer: {true}
"
1669,Does the history of Europe include the age of dinosaurs?,"Explanation: The age of dinosaurs, the Mesozoic Era, ended approximately 66 million years ago.  Human history and the history of Europe as we understand it only spans a few thousand years.  The Mesozoic Era is vastly predates the emergence of humans and therefore is not part of European history.

Answer: {false}
"
1670,Was Florence Nightingale's death more painful than Saint Peter's?,"Florence Nightingale died peacefully in her sleep at age 90.  There's no evidence to suggest her death was painful.  The account of Saint Peter's death is not consistently described in religious texts, but it's generally not depicted as particularly painful,  often described as a peaceful passing.  Therefore, there's no basis to compare the pain levels of their deaths. While one could argue that any death involves some level of discomfort, without specifics, it's impossible to determine which death was more painful.

Answer: {false}
"
1671,Could a firewall be destroyed by a hammer?,"Answer: A hammer is a tool capable of inflicting blunt force trauma.  Firewalls, while they may be virtual (software-based), often have physical components, such as servers and networking hardware.  A hammer could be used to damage or destroy these physical components.  Therefore, it is plausible that a firewall could be destroyed by a hammer.

Answer: {true}
"
1672,If Martin Luther did one theses a day would he run out in half a year?,"Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses were published in 1517.  A half year is approximately 180 days.  Since 180 days is less than 95 days, he would *not* run out of theses in half a year if he only did one a day.

Answer: {false}
"
1673,Can Roman numerals fill the normal number of Sudoku box options?,"A standard Sudoku puzzle uses the digits 1 through 9.  Roman numerals can represent these numbers (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX).  However, the question is whether Roman numerals can fill *all* the boxes in a Sudoku puzzle using only the standard representation of each digit.  They can't, because standard Roman numerals require multiple characters for some numbers (e.g., IV, IX).  A Sudoku puzzle requires each number to fit into a single square. Therefore, Roman numerals, as they are typically used, can not be used to represent the complete number set needed to fill a Sudoku grid.

Answer: {false}
"
1674,Is Alistair Darling in favor of Scottish independence?,"Alistair Darling is a prominent figure in the Scottish independence debate, but he is firmly against Scottish independence.

1675,Do inanimate objects come alive in Beauty and the Beast?,"Explanation:
The central plot of Beauty and the Beast revolves around enchanted objects within the Beast's castle.  These objects, such as the candlestick Lumiere, the clock Cogsworth, and the teapot Mrs. Potts, are given life through a magical curse.  Therefore, inanimate objects do come alive in the story.

Answer: {true}
"
1676,Can bottlenose dolphins hypothetically outbreed human women?,"Bottlenose dolphins have a much shorter gestation period and reach sexual maturity much faster than humans.  While the exact reproductive rate varies based on environmental factors and population density, it is feasible, hypothetically, that a population of bottlenose dolphins could outbreed a population of human women given certain, highly unlikely, conditions. This would necessitate an extremely high birth rate for dolphins and a very low birth rate for humans.

Answer: {true}
"
1677,Could Scooby Doo fit in a kangaroo pouch?,"Answer: A kangaroo pouch is typically around 12 inches deep. Scooby Doo, being a Great Dane, is significantly larger than 12 inches tall.  Therefore, Scooby Doo would not fit in a kangaroo pouch.

"
1678,Does Julia Roberts lose the prolific acting contest in her family?,"Julia Roberts' family has a number of actors, including her half-sister Nancy Motes and her niece Emma Roberts.  While Julia Roberts is incredibly successful,  it's impossible to definitively say whether she ""loses"" a ""prolific acting contest"" within her family.  The term ""prolific"" implies a high volume of work, and while Julia Roberts is extremely famous, her output might not be larger than the combined output of all the other acting members of her family throughout their careers.  The question is subjective and depends on how one defines ""prolific.""  Therefore, a definitive answer is not possible.

Answer: {false}
"
1679,Would stargazers prefer binoculars over a telescope?,"Explanation:
The choice between binoculars and a telescope for stargazing depends on the observer's needs and preferences.  Binoculars offer a wider field of view, making them ideal for locating constellations and larger celestial objects like nebulae and star clusters.  They are also generally more portable and less expensive than telescopes. Telescopes, on the other hand, provide higher magnification, allowing for a closer and more detailed view of specific objects.  Therefore, neither is universally superior; the best choice depends on the observing goals. While some stargazers might prefer binoculars for their ease of use and wider view, others may prioritize the higher magnification of a telescope.

1680,Would Ringo Starr avoid the pot roast at a restaurant?,"Ringo Starr is a vegetarian.  Pot roast is a meat dish.  Therefore, he would likely avoid it.

Answer: {true}
"
1681,Can a person be diagnosed with a Great Depression?,"The term ""Great Depression"" refers to the severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929.  It's a historical event, not a diagnosable mental health condition.  While an individual might experience a severe depressive episode during a time of economic hardship like the Great Depression, a mental health professional would diagnose them with a specific condition like major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or another form of depression, not with ""the Great Depression"" itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1682,Would only warm weather attire be a good idea on Mercury?,"The surface temperature of Mercury fluctuates wildly.  During the day, temperatures can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), while at night they plummet to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius).  Therefore, even ""warm weather attire"" would be insufficient protection during the daytime, and completely inadequate at night.  Only a specialized spacesuit offering extreme temperature regulation would be appropriate.

Answer: {false}
"
1683,Did Helen Keller ever read a novel by J. K. Rowling?,"Helen Keller was born in 1880 and died in 1968.  J.K. Rowling's first novel, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published in 1997.  Therefore, Helen Keller could not have read any of J.K. Rowling's novels.

Answer: {false}
"
1684,Would a recruit for the United States Marine Corps be turned away for self harm?,"The United States Marine Corps has strict physical and mental health standards for recruits.  Self-harm is a significant indicator of potential mental health issues, which could impact a recruit's ability to perform their duties and handle the intense physical and psychological demands of Marine Corps training.  While a single instance of self-harm might not automatically disqualify a candidate, it would certainly trigger a thorough evaluation of their mental health.  The Marine Corps would likely require a comprehensive psychological assessment to determine the severity and nature of the self-harm, and whether it poses a risk to the recruit or their fellow Marines.  Depending on the findings, the recruit could be deemed unfit for service.

Answer: {true}
"
1685,Was disc jockey Jay Thomas enemies with Clayton Moore?,"Jay Thomas was a radio and television personality known for his comedic roles and appearances on shows like ""Murphy Brown.""  Clayton Moore was the actor who famously portrayed the Lone Ranger in the 1950s television series.  There's no public information or record suggesting any animosity or conflict between Jay Thomas and Clayton Moore.  Their careers were in different fields and spanned different eras, with little to no overlap.

"
1687,Are some chiropractic manipulations dangerous?,"Chiropractic manipulation involves adjusting the spine and other joints. While generally considered safe and effective for many musculoskeletal conditions, there are potential risks associated with certain manipulations.  These risks, though relatively low, include but are not limited to:

* **Stroke:**  Although rare, there is a small increased risk of stroke following neck manipulation, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions affecting the blood vessels in the neck.
* **Nerve damage:** Improper manipulation can potentially damage nerves, leading to pain, numbness, or weakness.
* **Ligament or muscle injury:**  Excessive force or inappropriate techniques can cause tears or sprains in ligaments or muscles.
* **Headache:** Some individuals may experience headaches following chiropractic treatment.
* **Other complications:**  Less frequent but possible complications include disc herniation or exacerbation of existing spinal conditions.


The safety of chiropractic manipulation largely depends on the skill and experience of the practitioner, the patient's health status, and the specific technique used.  A thorough history and examination are crucial before any manipulation is performed.  While many people benefit from chiropractic care, the potential for adverse effects means it's not entirely risk-free.

1688,Is Olivia Newton-John hyphenated celebrity name with most letters?,"Olivia Newton-John's name has 18 letters.  To determine if it's the hyphenated celebrity name with the most letters, we'd need to compare it to other hyphenated celebrity names.  However, without a comprehensive list of all hyphenated celebrity names and their letter counts, we cannot definitively say whether Olivia Newton-John's name has the most letters.  The question requires more information than is readily available.

"
1692,Does crucifixion violate US eighth amendment?,"The Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.  Crucifixion is a method of execution that involves nailing a person to a cross and leaving them to die.  This is widely considered a particularly brutal and inhumane method of execution, far exceeding the standards of what is considered acceptable punishment under modern legal standards, even considering historical context. Therefore, crucifixion would likely be deemed cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment.

1697,Do people watching Coen brothers films in Guinea Bissau need subtitles?,"The question asks whether people in Guinea-Bissau watching Coen brothers films would need subtitles.  To answer this, we need to consider the official language(s) of Guinea-Bissau and the language(s) in which Coen brothers films are typically released.

Guinea-Bissau's official languages are Portuguese and Crioulo.  Coen brothers films are typically released in English.  Since neither Portuguese nor Crioulo is English, viewers in Guinea-Bissau would likely require subtitles to understand the dialogue.

"
1700,Are the Vietnamese people a great untapped resource for NBA players?,"While there are Vietnamese people who play basketball, there is no significant evidence to suggest they are a ""great untapped resource"" for NBA players compared to other populations globally.  The NBA draws talent from a diverse range of countries, but the prevalence of players from certain regions is largely influenced by factors like access to training, coaching resources, and the overall development of basketball infrastructure within those regions. While there might be talented basketball players in Vietnam, the lack of a robust and widespread basketball culture compared to countries like the US, Canada, or some European nations makes it unlikely that Vietnam would be a significant source of NBA players.

1703,Do calico cat patterns cover every drain fly color variety?,"Calico cat patterns are a result of X-chromosome inactivation, leading to a random distribution of orange and black fur.  Drain flies, on the other hand, exhibit a range of colors (often brownish or black), determined by their genetics and species.  There's no inherent connection between the random fur patterns of calico cats and the coloration of drain flies.  The question implies a relationship that doesn't exist.

"
1704,Is the Golden eagle considered a scavenger bird?,"Golden eagles are primarily hunters, actively pursuing prey like rabbits, rodents, and even larger animals.  While they might occasionally scavenge if an easy meal presents itself, scavenging is not their primary food source.  Their hunting prowess and reliance on killing their own food sets them apart from birds that are primarily considered scavengers.

"
1711,Does a Generation Y member satisfy NYPD police officer age requirement?,"Explanation:
To answer this question, we need to know the age range of Generation Y (also known as Millennials) and the NYPD police officer age requirements.

Generation Y is generally considered to be born between 1981 and 1996.  Therefore, the youngest members of Generation Y would be at least 27 years old in 2023 (1996 + 27 = 2023), while the oldest would be 42.

The NYPD's age requirements for police officers vary slightly depending on the specific program, but generally fall within a range that would include some, but not all, members of Generation Y.  The NYPD likely has minimum and maximum age requirements, some younger Millennials would not meet the minimum age requirement and some older Millennials would not meet the maximum age requirement.

Therefore, while *some* members of Generation Y would satisfy the NYPD police officer age requirements, not *all* would.

1713,Is pickled cucumber ever red?,"Pickled cucumbers, also known as pickles, are typically green or sometimes yellow-green depending on the cucumber variety and pickling process.  However, there are recipes and commercially produced pickled cucumbers that are red.  This red color is often achieved through the addition of food coloring or by using naturally red-colored pickling spices or ingredients.  Therefore, while not the standard, red pickled cucumbers do exist.

Answer: {true}
"
1714,Does coding rely on Boolean algebra characters?,"Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra dealing with logical operations and binary values (true/false, 1/0).  Coding, at its most fundamental level, relies heavily on these binary values to control program flow and evaluate conditions.  Conditional statements (like ""if-then-else"" structures), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and bitwise operations all utilize Boolean algebra's principles.  While the specific characters used to represent Boolean values might vary depending on the programming language (e.g., `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`), the underlying logic is inherently Boolean.

"
1718,Are months based on the solar cycle?,"The length of months in our Gregorian calendar is not directly based on the solar cycle in a precise, consistent way.  While the calendar year aims to align with the solar year (the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun), the individual months are of varying lengths and don't reflect direct solar phenomena.  Some months have 30 days, others 31, and February has 28 or 29, depending on whether it's a leap year.  This system is a historical artifact of various calendars over time, rather than a direct reflection of solar cycles.

Answer: {false}
"
1719,Is Route 66 generally unknown to Americans?,"Route 66 is a historically significant highway in the United States, famously associated with Americana and popular culture.  Its imagery and history have been featured in countless books, movies, television shows, and songs. While it no longer exists as a continuous, numbered route, many sections are still maintained and traveled, and it remains a popular destination for road trips. Therefore, it's inaccurate to say it's generally unknown to Americans.

"
1722,Can a human heart last from NYC to Raleigh NC by Toyota Hiux?,"The question asks if a human heart could last in transit from NYC to Raleigh, NC, in a Toyota Hilux.  The viability of a human heart for transplant depends critically on its temperature and preservation method.  Transportation time is a major factor. The distance between NYC and Raleigh is approximately 450 miles, which could take a significant amount of time, depending on traffic and driving conditions.  Even with a short driving time, the heart would need to be maintained at a very specific temperature in an appropriate preservation system.  A regular Toyota Hilux, without specialized equipment to maintain these conditions, would be unlikely to support the heart's viability for the duration of the trip.

1726,Would a snakebite hypothetically be a threat to T-1000?,"Answer: The T-1000 is a fictional Terminator from the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day.  It is a liquid metal robot that can rapidly repair itself and reform its shape.  A snakebite would not penetrate the T-1000's liquid metal body, and even if it did, the T-1000's self-repair capabilities would quickly negate any damage from venom. Therefore, a snakebite would not be a threat.

Answer: {false}
"
1727,Could a white belt defeat Jon Jones in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu match?,"Jon Jones is a highly accomplished mixed martial artist with extensive experience in grappling, including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).  He has demonstrated high-level BJJ skills in his professional fights.  A white belt in BJJ represents a beginner level of proficiency with minimal training and experience. The skill disparity between a white belt and a world-class competitor like Jon Jones is immense.  It's extremely improbable, bordering on impossible, that a white belt could defeat Jon Jones in a BJJ match.

Answer: {false}
"
1728,Does Darth Vader's character resemble Severus Snape?,"Answer: Both Darth Vader and Severus Snape are complex characters with hidden depths and motivations.  While their outward appearances and immediate allegiances differ greatly (Vader a seemingly merciless Sith Lord, Snape a seemingly antagonistic Potions master), both characters grapple with internal conflicts, conflicted loyalties, and ultimately demonstrate a capacity for self-sacrifice and love that runs contrary to their initially perceived natures.  Both characters also have a history connected to a chosen one (Luke Skywalker for Vader, Harry Potter for Snape).  However, their motivations, methods, and ultimate sacrifices are quite different. The similarities are superficial, based mostly on the trope of the initially villainous character who turns out to have more complex morality than initially presented.  The fundamental differences in their actions and overall arcs outweigh any surface similarities.

Answer: {false}
"
1729,Were weather phenomena avoided when naming minor league baseball teams?,"Minor league baseball teams often use names that evoke a sense of place, local history, or even quirky humor.  While some team names might indirectly refer to weather (e.g., a team named the ""Thunderbolts""), the naming process doesn't explicitly *avoid* weather phenomena.  In fact, many minor league teams have names directly related to weather, such as the Storm Chasers, Rainmakers, or even the Sun Kings. There's no evidence of a league-wide policy to avoid weather-related names.

Answer: {false}
"
1730,Did Johann Sebastian Bach influence heavy metal?,"Johann Sebastian Bach's music, while incredibly influential on classical and baroque music, is not directly linked to the development of heavy metal.  Heavy metal's sound and aesthetic are rooted in blues, rock and roll, and other 20th-century genres. While some heavy metal musicians may appreciate or draw inspiration from Bach's compositional techniques or the overall concept of musical complexity, there's no direct lineage or demonstrable influence.  The stylistic differences are too vast.

Answer: {false}
"
1731,Can a cheetah generate enough force to topple Big Show?,"Explanation:
To determine if a cheetah could generate enough force to topple Big Show (a professional wrestler known for his immense size and strength), we need to consider several factors:

* **Cheetah's Force:** Cheetahs are known for their incredible acceleration and speed, not brute strength.  While they possess powerful muscles for sprinting, their force is applied over a short period and primarily focused on propelling their own lightweight body.  They don't have the sustained pushing power of a much larger animal.

* **Big Show's Mass and Stability:** Big Show is significantly larger and heavier than a cheetah.  His massive weight provides considerable stability, making him resistant to being easily pushed over.  His training as a wrestler also likely enhances his balance and ability to resist external forces.

* **Nature of Force Application:**  A cheetah's force would likely be applied as a brief impact, not a sustained push.  It would be difficult for a cheetah to maintain contact with Big Show to generate sufficient force for a topple.

Considering the disparity in size, weight, and the nature of the forces involved, it's highly improbable that a cheetah could generate enough force to topple Big Show.

Answer: {false}
"
1732,Are paratroopers good at mountain rescue?,"Paratroopers receive extensive training in jumping from aircraft and landing safely, as well as navigating and operating in various terrains, including potentially mountainous regions.  However, mountain rescue requires specialized skills and equipment beyond basic paratrooper training, such as mountaineering techniques, knowledge of high-altitude environments, search and rescue expertise, and specific equipment for climbing and rappelling. While a paratrooper's training might give them some advantages in certain aspects of mountain rescue, they wouldn't be inherently *good* at it compared to trained mountain rescue professionals.  Their skills are transferable to some extent, but not equivalent.

Answer: {false}
"
1733,Did any cultures associate celery with death?,"Some cultures have associated celery with death or funerals, primarily due to its association with mourning and remembrance, not necessarily an inherent belief that the plant itself causes death.  The association isn't universal, and its significance varies depending on the specific culture and context.  Therefore, while not a widely held belief, there is evidence to support the idea that some cultures have linked celery to death in some symbolic way.

Answer: {true}
"
1734,Was Woodrow Wilson sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party?,"Woodrow Wilson (Democrat) was preceded by William Howard Taft (Republican) and succeeded by Warren G. Harding (Republican).  Therefore, he was indeed sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party.

"
1735,"Were there under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965?","Answer: The peak of US troop deployment in Vietnam was not reached until 1968.  In 1965, the number of US troops in Vietnam was significantly lower than the peak numbers. While precise figures vary depending on the source and the date within the year, the number of US troops in Vietnam in 1965 was considerably less than 150,000.  Therefore, the statement ""Were there under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965?"" is true.

"
1738,Did the Wehrmacht affect the outcome of the War to End All Wars?,"The ""War to End All Wars"" is another name for World War I.  The Wehrmacht was the armed forces of Nazi Germany, and it did not exist during World War I.  The Wehrmacht was formed in 1935, long after World War I concluded. Therefore, the Wehrmacht could not have affected the outcome of World War I.

"
1739,Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?,"Lil Wayne was born on September 27, 1982.  The minimum driving age in Louisiana, where he's from, is 16.  Therefore, at the very beginning of his career, it's unlikely he would have been old enough to legally operate a vehicle on his own, as his career began when he was very young.

Answer: {false}
"
1740,Was Lord Voldemort taught by Professor Dumbledore?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:  Lord Voldemort (Tom Riddle) was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he was not taught by Professor Dumbledore.  While Dumbledore was the Headmaster during Riddle's time at Hogwarts, he was not Riddle's personal tutor or even his house head (Snape was a rival student and later Head of Slytherin).  Albus Dumbledore was certainly aware of Tom Riddle, and played a significant role in events involving him later in life, but he was not his teacher.
"
1741,Does Olympia Washington share name with Hephaestus's workshop location?,"Hephaestus's workshop, in Greek mythology, is located on Mount Olympus.  Olympia, Washington, is named after the site of the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, at the foot of Mount Olympus. While both locations share a connection to ""Olympus,"" they are not the same place.  Olympia, Washington's name is derived from the location of the ancient games, not directly from Hephaestus's workshop.

1744,Did the Watergate scandal help the Republican party?,"The Watergate scandal, a major political scandal in the United States, involved the abuse of power by President Richard Nixon and his administration.  The scandal led to Nixon's resignation and damaged the public's trust in the Republican party.  While some might argue that the party eventually recovered, the immediate and long-term effects were largely negative, leading to a period of political instability and a decline in public support for the party.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the Watergate scandal helped the Republican party.

1749,Can black swan's formation type help spell longest word in Dictionary?,"The question asks if the formation type of a black swan's flight can be used to spell the longest word in the dictionary.  This is a nonsensical question.  Black swans don't form letters in their flight patterns, and there's no objective longest word in any dictionary (length varies by dictionary and inclusion criteria).  The premise is inherently false.

Answer: {false}
"
1750,Does the name C-SPAN refer to a form of telecommunications that utilizes outer space?,"C-SPAN stands for Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network.  While ""satellite"" is in the name, implying a connection to outer space, the use of satellites is simply a method of broadcasting the network's content.  The core function of C-SPAN is not intrinsically tied to outer space technology; it's primarily a television network that broadcasts government proceedings and public affairs programming. The use of satellites is a means of distribution, not the defining characteristic of the network itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1751,Would Kelly Clarkson's voice shake glass?,"Answer: Kelly Clarkson is known for her powerful singing voice.  While it's unlikely to be powerful enough to physically shatter glass, the idea of a powerful voice shattering glass is a common trope in fiction and popular culture.  There's no scientific evidence to suggest Kelly Clarkson's voice has this ability.  The phenomenon of shattering glass with sound requires extremely high-frequency and high-intensity sound waves, typically beyond the range of a human voice.

Answer: {false}

"
1756,Is a northern fur seal needing emergency surgery in July likely a safe anesthesia candidate?,"Northern fur seals are prone to several physiological conditions that can complicate anesthesia.  Their body temperature fluctuates more than that of many other mammals, making temperature regulation during anesthesia more challenging.  Additionally, they are particularly sensitive to the effects of certain anesthetic drugs. In July, they are likely to be molting and in poor body condition which increases the risk of complications during surgery. The combination of these factors makes them a higher-risk anesthesia candidate in comparison to other, healthier animals. Therefore, while emergency surgery may be necessary, a northern fur seal in July would not be considered a *safe* anesthesia candidate.

Answer: {false}
"
1757,"Does Orange County, California require airplanes to be quiet?","Orange County, California, like many other areas, has noise ordinances related to aircraft.  However, these ordinances don't necessarily require airplanes to be ""quiet,"" but rather regulate noise levels to prevent excessive disturbance.  They often specify decibel limits and times of day when certain noise levels are prohibited.  While the county aims to mitigate aircraft noise,  it doesn't mandate complete silence from airplanes.  The focus is on managing noise pollution rather than eliminating it entirely.

1758,Was Charlemagne's father instrumental in outcome of the Battle of Tours?,"Charlemagne's father was Pepin the Short.  The Battle of Tours (also known as the Battle of Poitiers) was fought in 732 AD. Pepin the Short became King of the Franks in 751 AD.  Therefore, Pepin the Short could not have been instrumental in the outcome of the Battle of Tours as he was not yet king, and likely not even a major player in Frankish politics at that time.

1761,Is strep throat harmless to singer Rita Ora after her 2020 tonsilitis surgery?,"Explanation:
Rita Ora had a tonsillectomy in 2020.  A tonsillectomy is the surgical removal of the tonsils. Strep throat is a bacterial infection of the tonsils.  While a tonsillectomy might remove the site of a strep infection, it doesn't guarantee immunity.  Having strep throat after a tonsillectomy is possible, and while usually treatable with antibiotics, it's not harmless.  It could lead to complications if left untreated.

"
1763,Could the Powepuff Girls make the background to the Azerbaijani flag?,"The Azerbaijani flag is a horizontal tricolor of blue, red, and green.  The Powerpuff Girls are cartoon characters with distinct appearances (Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup).  While it's possible to imagine the Powerpuff Girls *stylized* in a way that incorporates the colors of the Azerbaijani flag into their design, replacing the flag's solid color fields with the characters themselves would fundamentally change the flag's design and meaning.  The question asks if they could *make* the background, implying a complete substitution. This is not possible without altering the flag's established design.

Answer: {false}
"
1764,Was Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena hypothetically inadequate for hosting Coachella?,"The Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena is a relatively small indoor venue compared to the scale of Coachella.  Coachella is an outdoor music festival that draws hundreds of thousands of attendees over multiple days.  The Memorial Sports Arena's capacity is significantly smaller and lacks the infrastructure to support a festival of that magnitude.  It does not have the necessary space for multiple stages, camping grounds, food vendors, and other amenities required for an event like Coachella.

"
1766,Would Bandy be likely to become popular in Texas?,"Bandy is a field sport played on ice, requiring a frozen playing surface.  Texas has a generally warm climate and does not have widespread access to naturally occurring or consistently maintained ice rinks suitable for playing bandy.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that bandy would gain popularity in Texas due to the lack of suitable infrastructure and climate.

"
1768,Can pancreas removal cause bankruptcy?,"The removal of a pancreas necessitates extensive medical care, including surgery, hospitalization, post-operative care, and potential long-term management of diabetes and other complications.  These medical expenses can be extraordinarily high, potentially exceeding insurance coverage and leading to significant debt.  This debt, in turn, could cause bankruptcy for individuals without sufficient financial resources.  The severity depends on factors such as pre-existing health conditions, insurance coverage, and access to affordable healthcare.

Answer: {true}

Therefore, sunscreen would be helpful in preventing this condition.

Answer: {false}
"
1770,Would Lord Voldemort have been barred from Hogwarts under his own rules?,"Lord Voldemort, or Tom Riddle, was a student at Hogwarts who later became a dark wizard.  Hogwarts' rules, as enforced by the staff, forbid the use of dark magic and acts of violence against other students and staff. Voldemort clearly and repeatedly violated these rules throughout his schooling and after.  He practiced dark magic, attempted to murder others, and used forbidden spells.  Therefore, under his own school's rules, Voldemort would have been expelled, if not worse.

Answer: {true}
"
1771,"Would moon cakes be easy to find in Chinatown, Manhattan?","Mooncakes are a traditional food associated with the Mid-Autumn Festival, a significant holiday in many East and Southeast Asian cultures.  Chinatown in Manhattan has a large population of people from these cultures and boasts many Asian businesses, including bakeries and grocery stores specializing in Asian foods.  Therefore, it's highly likely that mooncakes would be readily available during the appropriate season (around the Mid-Autumn Festival) in Chinatown, Manhattan.

"
1776,Would Lord Voldemort hypothetically be an effective fighter after Final Fantasy silence is cast?,"Answer: Silence in Final Fantasy games prevents the target from using spells or abilities.  Lord Voldemort's power is heavily reliant on his magical abilities.  If he is silenced, he would lose a significant portion of his fighting capabilities, making him far less effective.  He would likely still be able to use some physical combat skills, but his overall effectiveness as a fighter would be drastically reduced.

Answer: {false}
"
1777,Can you buy chlorine at a dollar store?,"Dollar stores typically stock a wide variety of household cleaning supplies, but the availability of chlorine, particularly in its concentrated forms (like bleach), can vary.  While some dollar stores might carry diluted bleach solutions, it's less likely they would carry the concentrated forms used for pool maintenance or other industrial purposes due to safety concerns and potential regulations. Therefore, it's uncertain if chlorine would be consistently available at a dollar store.


Answer: {false}
"
1778,Is hanging a viable execution method on a ship at sea?,"Hanging as an execution method relies on a sudden, significant drop to break the neck.  On a ship at sea, the motion of the vessel, including rolling and pitching, would make achieving a consistent and reliable drop nearly impossible. The unpredictable movement of the ship could lead to an incomplete hanging, causing prolonged suffering and a less humane death.  Additionally, the potential for the body to swing and collide with parts of the ship poses a significant risk.  For these reasons, hanging at sea would be highly impractical and unreliable as an execution method.

Answer: {false}
"
1779,Does Disney have an ice princess?,"Disney's film ""Frozen"" features Elsa, a princess with ice and snow powers.  While she isn't explicitly called an ""ice princess"" in the film's title, the character and her powers strongly align with that description.

"
1782,Does monster name in West African Folklore that witches send into villages set Scrabble record?,"The question asks if a monster name in West African folklore that witches send into villages set a Scrabble record.  There's no information readily available connecting a specific monster name from West African folklore to a Scrabble record.  Scrabble records are typically associated with high-scoring words played in legitimate games, not with folklore creatures. Therefore, it's highly improbable that such a connection exists.

Answer: {false}
"
1783,Is Rosemary outclassed as plant found in most song titles?,"The question asks if Rosemary is outclassed as a plant found in most song titles.  To answer this, we need to compare the frequency of ""rosemary"" in song titles to the frequency of other plants.  We don't have access to a comprehensive database of song titles to perform this comparison.  Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if rosemary is outclassed in terms of its appearance in song titles.  Without that data, we can only conclude it's unknown whether rosemary is more or less frequent than other plants in song titles.

Answer: {unknown}
"
1784,Is a person with St. Vitus's Dance likely to win a ballet competition?,"St. Vitus's Dance, also known as Sydenham's chorea, is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, jerky movements.  These movements are unpredictable and affect the body's ability to perform coordinated actions.  Ballet requires precise control and coordination.  Therefore, someone with St. Vitus's Dance would be significantly impaired in their ability to perform ballet, making it highly unlikely they would win a competition.

"
1787,Is an ocelot a good present for a kindergartener?,"An ocelot is a wild cat, a member of the Felidae family.  They are not domesticated animals and require specialized care, including a large enclosure, specific diet, and veterinary attention.  Ocelots are also wild animals with unpredictable behavior; they could pose a significant danger to a young child.  Giving a kindergartener an ocelot as a present would be incredibly irresponsible and potentially dangerous.

Answer: {false}
"
1788,Was Alaska part of the Northern Army during the Civil War?,"The Civil War (1861-1865) was fought between the Union (Northern) and Confederate (Southern) states.  Alaska was not part of the United States during the Civil War.  It was purchased from Russia in 1867, after the war had ended. Therefore, Alaska could not have been part of the Northern Army.

1789,Would New Year's Eve hypothetically be Bacchus's favorite holiday?,"Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, revelry, and theatre, is associated with festivities and celebrations.  New Year's Eve is a holiday characterized by widespread celebrations, parties, and drinking.  Therefore, it's plausible that Bacchus would enjoy New Year's Eve.

Answer: {true}
"
1790,Is Poseidon similar to the god Vulcan?,"Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, and Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and metalworking, are not similar in their domains or attributes.  Poseidon's power is over the oceans, earthquakes, and storms, while Vulcan's is over crafting, fire, and volcanoes.  Their personalities are also distinct; Poseidon is often depicted as tempestuous and unpredictable, whereas Vulcan is typically portrayed as a hardworking and skilled craftsman. While both are powerful gods, their spheres of influence are entirely different.

Answer: {false}
"
1791,Did travelers sing sea shanties on the Oregon Trail?,"Sea shanties were a common form of entertainment and work song for sailors.  The Oregon Trail, however, was an overland route traveled by pioneers in wagons, not by sea. While pioneers may have sung songs during their arduous journey, sea shanties wouldn't have been particularly relevant to their experience.

Answer: {false}
"
1792,Could morphine cure HIV?,"Morphine is an opioid analgesic used to treat pain.  HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system.  These are entirely different things; morphine has no effect on HIV or its progression.  Morphine doesn't target the virus, nor does it boost the immune system's ability to fight it.  Therefore, morphine cannot cure HIV.

Answer: {false}
"
1793,Do the directors of The Matrix advocate for transgender rights?,"The Wachowskis, the directors of The Matrix, are transgender women.  Their public identities as transgender women and their advocacy for transgender rights are well-documented. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they advocate for transgender rights.

"
1794,Would menu at Chinese Starbucks be familiar to an American?,"Starbucks is a global company with a largely standardized menu. While there might be some regional variations to cater to local tastes, the core menu items (coffees, teas, pastries) would be largely familiar to an American.  The drinks might have slightly different names, but the overall offerings would be easily recognizable.

Answer: {true}
"
1795,Does Mario use mushrooms to run faster?,"In the Super Mario games, mushrooms grant Mario increased size, not increased speed.  While bigger Mario might *seem* faster due to the increased jump height and momentum, the core mechanic of the mushroom is to increase his size.

Answer: {false}
"
1796,Can children become lieutenants?,"The answer depends on what kind of lieutenant we are talking about.  In many countries, there are military lieutenants, who are commissioned officers.  There are also other kinds of lieutenants, in organizations or positions that aren't military.   Generally, becoming a military lieutenant requires extensive training, experience, and age requirements, making it impossible for children. While some non-military organizations might have the title ""lieutenant,"" they are unlikely to have members that are children.

Answer: {false}
"
1797,Is the QWERTY keyboard layout meant to be slow?,"The QWERTY keyboard layout's origins are often attributed to a need to prevent typewriters from jamming.  Early mechanical typewriters had a tendency to jam if adjacent keys were struck in rapid succession.  The QWERTY layout, by separating frequently used letter combinations, aimed to mitigate this problem. While it did address the mechanical limitations of the time, it wasn't intentionally designed to be slow.  Its design was a compromise to improve the functionality of the technology then available, not to reduce typing speed.  Modern keyboards don't have the same mechanical constraints, yet the QWERTY layout persists due to its widespread adoption and ingrained familiarity.

Answer: {false}
"
1798,Would Nancy Pelosi have hypothetically been on same side as Gerald Ford?,"Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat and Gerald Ford was a Republican.  While there might have been instances of agreement on specific issues, their overall political ideologies and party affiliations would generally place them on opposing sides of most major political debates.

Answer: {false}
"
1799,Do Sweet Potatoes prevent other plants from growing in their place?,"Sweet potatoes, like many other plants, release chemicals into the soil called allelochemicals.  These chemicals can inhibit the growth of other plants, a process called allelopathy.  The extent of this inhibition varies depending on the variety of sweet potato, the soil conditions, and the other plants involved. While sweet potatoes are not known for being exceptionally aggressive allelopathic plants, they can still affect nearby plants to some degree.

Answer: {true}
"
1800,Would a hedgehog avoid animals without a spinal cord?,"Hedgehogs are insectivores with a diet primarily consisting of insects, worms, and other invertebrates.  While they are opportunistic feeders and might consume other small creatures, their predation is largely targeted at animals with a nervous system, including a spinal cord.  Animals without a spinal cord, such as jellyfish or certain types of worms, are unlikely to be a significant part of their diet.  Therefore, a hedgehog would not necessarily *avoid* these animals, but they wouldn't actively seek them out as food.

Answer: {false}
"
1801,Can paresthesia be caused by a white pigment?,"Paresthesia is a sensation of tingling, numbness, or prickling, often caused by nerve damage or irritation.  White pigments, such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, are generally inert and not known to directly cause nerve damage or irritation that would lead to paresthesia. While some pigments might contain trace amounts of other substances, there's no established link between common white pigments and paresthesia.  Exposure to certain chemicals or substances *can* cause nerve damage leading to paresthesia, but this isn't directly tied to the white pigment itself but rather potential contaminants or associated exposure.

Answer: {false}
"
1802,"Are Scottish people descended from Mary, Queen of Scots part French?","Mary, Queen of Scots was of French and Scottish descent.  Her mother, Mary of Guise, was French, while her father, James V of Scotland, was Scottish.  Therefore, anyone descended from Mary, Queen of Scots would have some degree of French ancestry through her mother.

1803,Did any citizen of San Antonio vote for Boris Johnson?,"Explanation: Boris Johnson is a British politician, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  San Antonio is a city in Texas, United States.  Citizens of San Antonio would not be eligible to vote in a British election. Therefore, no citizen of San Antonio could have voted for Boris Johnson.


Answer: {false}
"
1804,Does handedness determine how you use American Sign Language?,"American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language that utilizes handshapes, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning. While dominant hand preference (right- or left-handedness) might influence which hand a signer uses more frequently for certain signs, it doesn't determine *how* they use the language.  ASL grammar, sentence structure, and the vast majority of signs are not dictated by handedness.  Signers adapt and use both hands effectively to produce fluid and grammatically correct ASL regardless of their dominant hand.  A left-handed signer will still use the same signs as a right-handed signer, though their hand dominance might be subtly apparent.

Answer: {false}
"
1805,Did the confederate states speak Old English before the Civil War?,"The Confederate States of America existed from 1861 to 1865.  Old English was a language spoken in England from roughly 450 to 1150 AD.  There's a gap of centuries between the time period when Old English was spoken and the existence of the Confederacy. The language spoken in the Confederate States would have been primarily English, though with regional dialects and variations in vocabulary.

Answer: {true}
"
1808,Does Capricorn astrology symbol have all of the parts of a chimera?,"The Capricorn astrological symbol is a sea-goat, a creature with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish.  A chimera, on the other hand, is a mythological creature composed of parts from different animals. While the sea-goat has parts from two different animals, it doesn't necessarily encompass *all* the parts of a chimera, which can be far more complex and varied in its composition.  A chimera might include a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail, for example, or any other combination of animal parts.  The sea-goat only has two distinct parts.

Answer: {false}
"
1809,Was the Japanese street aesthetic once illuminated by noble gasses?,"Neon lights, a prominent feature of Japanese street aesthetics, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, utilize noble gases.  These gases, such as neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, emit characteristic colors when an electric current passes through them, creating the vibrant glow of neon signs.  Therefore, it's accurate to say that Japanese street aesthetics were, at one point, illuminated by noble gases.

Answer: {true}
"
1810,Can shooting bald eagle get a person more prison time than Michael Vick?,"Explanation:

Michael Vick's prison sentence was 23 months for his involvement in a dogfighting ring.  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act makes it illegal to harm bald eagles, with penalties including significant fines and up to one year in prison for a first offense. However, subsequent offenses, or offenses involving multiple eagles or other egregious circumstances, could lead to far more severe penalties.  It's possible, therefore, that shooting a bald eagle (especially multiple eagles or with aggravating circumstances) could result in a longer prison sentence than Vick received.  While a single bald eagle shooting would likely result in less time, the potential exists for a longer sentence based on the details of the offense.

"
1812,Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?,"Sophistry was a philosophical movement in ancient Greece that emphasized rhetoric and argumentation.  Sophists were known for their skill in persuasion, their ability to argue effectively on both sides of an issue, and their focus on winning arguments rather than necessarily pursuing truth.  Lawyers, similarly, need to be able to present compelling arguments, advocate for their clients effectively, and persuade judges or juries.  While the ethical considerations may differ – Sophists' focus on winning at all costs might clash with modern legal ethics – their rhetorical skills and understanding of argumentation would likely translate well to a legal career.

Answer: {true}
"
1813,4 Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts exceed AHA  daily sugar allowance?,"The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends a maximum of 25 grams of added sugar per day for women and 36 grams for men.  A Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut contains approximately 10 grams of added sugar.  Four doughnuts would therefore contain 40 grams of added sugar.  This exceeds the AHA's recommended daily intake for both men and women.

1815,Are people banned from entering the Forbidden City?,"The Forbidden City is a large palace complex in Beijing, China.  While it's not completely inaccessible, access is heavily restricted and controlled.  Visitors are not simply ""banned,"" but entry is regulated through timed ticketing systems and security checks.  There are specific areas within the Forbidden City that remain off-limits to the general public. Therefore, while people are not categorically banned from entering, access is controlled and limited.

Answer: {false}
"
1816,"If you have a serious injury in Bangladesh, would you probably dial a Fibonacci number?","The question asks if one would dial a Fibonacci number in case of a serious injury in Bangladesh.  Fibonacci numbers are a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).  There's no logical connection between emergency numbers and the Fibonacci sequence. Emergency numbers in Bangladesh, or any country, are assigned based on practical considerations and memorability, not mathematical patterns.  Therefore, it is highly improbable that a Fibonacci number would be the emergency number.

Answer: {false}
"

Answer: {true}
"
1819,Is winter solstice in Northern Hemisphere closer to July than in Southern Hemisphere?,"The winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs around December 21st or 22nd.  The winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere occurs around June 21st or 22nd.  July is much closer to June than to December. Therefore, the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere is closer to July than the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.

Answer: {true}
"
1820,Do tourists prefer Tuvalu to Niue?,"To determine tourist preference between Tuvalu and Niue, we need to consider factors influencing tourist choices.  These include accessibility (ease and cost of travel), infrastructure (accommodation, activities), and unique attractions.  Both Tuvalu and Niue are small island nations in the Pacific with limited tourism infrastructure.  However,  information readily available online suggests that while both receive some tourism, Niue, with its relatively better developed infrastructure and more diverse activities (such as caves and hiking), likely attracts more tourists than Tuvalu.  While definitive statistics might be hard to come by, the available evidence points towards Niue having a slight edge.


Answer: {false}
"
1821,"Is ""A Tale of Two Cities"" a parody of the Bible?","""A Tale of Two Cities"" by Charles Dickens uses biblical allusions and parallels, but it is not a parody of the Bible.  While it employs similar narrative structures and themes (redemption, sacrifice, resurrection, etc.) found in the Bible, it does so to create a powerful narrative about the French Revolution, not to mock or satirize the Bible itself.  The similarities are thematic and structural, not directly satirical or mocking in nature.

Answer: {false}
"
1822,Can binary numbers and standard alphabet satisfy criteria for a strong password?,"A strong password generally needs to meet several criteria to be resistant to cracking.  These often include:

* **Length:**  The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.
* **Complexity:** A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols is crucial.
* **Predictability:** The password shouldn't be easily guessable (e.g., dictionary words, personal information).

Binary numbers (sequences of 0s and 1s) alone lack complexity. While they can contribute to length, they lack the variety of uppercase/lowercase letters and symbols.  The standard alphabet (26 letters) alone is also insufficient because it can be susceptible to dictionary attacks and lacks numbers and symbols.

However, combining binary numbers and the standard alphabet *can* contribute to a strong password *if* used effectively.  For instance, a password like ""P@$$wOrdB1n4ry1011"" incorporates both the alphabet (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols, along with a section of binary. The overall length and complexity are considerably improved compared to using either element alone.  It's the combination that is key.

Answer: {true}
"
1823,Did Andy Warhol influence Art Deco style?,"Andy Warhol was a prominent figure in the Pop Art movement, which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s.  Art Deco, on the other hand, flourished in the 1920s and 1930s.  While Warhol may have been *influenced by* earlier artistic styles, his work is distinctly Pop Art, and he's not considered to have influenced Art Deco, which predates his career.  Therefore, the answer is false.

Answer: {false}

"
1825,Has spinach been a source of power in a comic movie?,"Popeye the Sailor Man, a famous cartoon character, is known for his superhuman strength derived from eating spinach.  While Popeye is not strictly a comic movie character (he originated in comic strips and then transitioned to animation and film), his association with spinach as a source of power is iconic and widely recognized.  Therefore, even with a broad interpretation of ""comic movie,"" spinach's role in providing power is established through this popular cultural figure.

"
1826,Does welding with acetylene simulate the temperature of a star?,"Acetylene torches produce temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 3,300°C (5,432 to 5,972°F).  The surface temperature of stars varies greatly depending on their size and type.  However, even relatively cool stars are far hotter than an acetylene torch.  The surface temperature of the Sun, for example, is around 5,500°C (9,932°F), while some stars reach temperatures of tens of thousands or even millions of degrees Celsius. Therefore, while an acetylene torch produces a very high temperature, it does not simulate the temperature of even a relatively cool star.

Answer: {false}
"
1827,Can an adult male stand on top Donatello's bronze David and touch the Sistine Chapel ceiling?,"Donatello's bronze David is a relatively small sculpture.  The Sistine Chapel ceiling is very high.  Even if an adult male were able to precariously stand on top of Donatello's David (which would likely damage the sculpture and be incredibly dangerous), he would not be tall enough to reach the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  The height difference is insurmountable.

Answer: {false}
"
1828,Is it dangerous to consume chlorine when mixed with sodium?,"Chlorine (Cl₂) is a highly reactive gas, and sodium (Na) is a highly reactive metal.  When chlorine and sodium react, they undergo a vigorous exothermic reaction, forming sodium chloride (NaCl), which is common table salt.  The reaction itself produces a significant amount of heat and light.  While the *product* of the reaction, sodium chloride, is harmless in moderate amounts, the *process* of combining chlorine gas and sodium metal is extremely dangerous. Chlorine gas is toxic and corrosive, even at low concentrations.  Direct contact with the gas can cause severe respiratory problems and burns. Sodium metal reacts violently with water, producing hydrogen gas (which is flammable) and heat, so handling sodium metal requires extreme caution.  The combination of these two elements presents a serious risk of explosion, fire, and chemical burns. Therefore, consuming a mixture of chlorine and sodium is incredibly dangerous and should never be attempted.

Answer: {true}
"
1829,Could Moulin Rouge have been hypothetically used as Spain's Spanish American War triage center?,"The Spanish-American War (1898) took place primarily in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.  Moulin Rouge is a famous cabaret in Paris, France.  Therefore, Moulin Rouge's location makes it geographically impossible to have been used as a triage center for the Spanish-American War.

1830,Would Downton Abbey finale viewership defeat every Kazakhstan citizen in tug of war?,"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of Downton Abbey finale viewers to the population of Kazakhstan.  We don't have precise viewership numbers for the finale, but it was a highly popular show.  Even a conservative estimate of millions of viewers would massively outweigh the population of Kazakhstan (around 20 million).  In a tug-of-war, a larger number of participants generally translates to greater pulling force, especially if the participants are of similar average strength. While there might be some exceptionally strong individuals in Kazakhstan, the sheer number of Downton Abbey viewers would make a tug-of-war victory highly probable.

1831,Are some Do It Yourself projects potentially lethal?,"Explanation: Many DIY projects involve the use of tools, chemicals, and electricity, all of which can be dangerous if not handled properly.  Improper use of power tools can lead to serious injury,  handling chemicals without adequate safety precautions can result in burns, poisoning, or other health problems, and working with electricity can cause electrocution.  Therefore, some DIY projects are potentially lethal due to the inherent risks involved.

1833,Does Super Mario require electricity to play?,"Super Mario games, depending on the platform, can be played on various consoles and handheld devices.  These devices require electricity to operate.  While some older games might exist on cartridges that are played on devices that no longer require electricity (such as purely mechanical devices), the vast majority of Super Mario games require electrical power to function.

Answer: {true}
"
1834,Can Chinese mountain cat survive in the orbit?,"Explanation:
The Chinese mountain cat is a terrestrial mammal adapted to living in mountainous regions on Earth.  The conditions of Earth's orbit—vacuum of space, extreme temperature fluctuations, lack of breathable atmosphere, and intense radiation—are completely incompatible with terrestrial life.  No terrestrial animal, including the Chinese mountain cat, could survive in the vacuum of space without extensive life support systems.

Answer: {false}
"
1835,Will a rock float in the atmosphere of Earth?,"Explanation: Rocks are significantly denser than air.  The buoyant force acting on a rock in Earth's atmosphere is negligible compared to the rock's weight.  Therefore, the rock will not float.

Answer: {false}
"
1838,Were some people afraid of New Years Day coming in 1999?,"Explanation:
The year 1999 was the last year of the 20th century.  Many people associated the year 2000 with the start of a new millennium, leading to concerns about the Y2K bug, a potential computer systems failure due to the way dates were stored.  These fears, while not universally felt, were widespread enough that some people were indeed apprehensive about the arrival of 1999 and the upcoming year 2000. The anxieties weren't just about the new year's arrival itself but about the technological issues that were feared to accompany the date change.


Answer: {true}
"
1839,Would Woodrow Wilson support Plessy v. Ferguson decision?,"Woodrow Wilson, while president of the United States, oversaw a period of increased racial segregation within the federal government.  He implemented policies that reinforced Jim Crow laws and the separation of races.  The Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which upheld the legality of racial segregation under the ""separate but equal"" doctrine, aligned with Wilson's views and actions. Therefore, it's highly probable that he would have supported the decision.

1841,Can you hide a pet macaque under your desk?,"Answer:  A macaque is a monkey of considerable size.  Even a small macaque would be too large to comfortably hide under a standard desk.  Their size and the noise they would likely make would make concealment nearly impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
1842,Are there Pink music videos that are triggering for eating disorder patients?,"Pink has often incorporated themes of body positivity and self-acceptance in her work. However, some of her music videos feature scenes with intense choreography, rapid cuts, and idealized body types that could be triggering for individuals with eating disorders.  The visual nature of music videos and their emphasis on appearance make them a potential risk factor for triggering negative body image comparisons and unhealthy thoughts. While not all her videos would be triggering, some might be depending on the individual's sensitivity and stage of recovery.

Answer: {true}
"
1843,Can brewing occur in a prison environment?,"Answer: Brewing requires certain ingredients (grains, hops, yeast, water) and equipment (fermenters, etc.).  While some of these ingredients might be obtainable in a prison setting through smuggled items or repurposed materials, the necessary equipment is far less likely to be available.  Furthermore, the process of brewing, even on a small scale, carries a risk of detection and punishment within a prison environment. Therefore, while extremely difficult and risky, it is hypothetically possible.

Answer: {true}
"
1844,Can someone from New England profit by growing coffee?,"The climate in New England is not suitable for growing coffee. Coffee plants require a tropical or subtropical climate with consistently warm temperatures, high humidity, and ample rainfall. New England has a temperate climate with cold winters and shorter growing seasons, making it unsuitable for coffee cultivation.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely someone in New England could profitably grow coffee.

Answer: {false}
"
1847,Would a crocodile survive longer in Great Salt Lake than alligator?,"Alligators and crocodiles have different salinity tolerances.  Alligators are freshwater animals and cannot tolerate the high salinity of Great Salt Lake. Crocodiles, while generally preferring freshwater, have a greater tolerance for brackish or slightly saline water.  While the Great Salt Lake's salinity is extreme, a crocodile might survive for a short period, possibly longer than an alligator which would likely perish quickly.  However, prolonged survival in such a high-salinity environment would be unlikely for either reptile.  The alligator would die more quickly.

Answer: {true}
"
1848,Was Saudi Aramco started due to an assassination?,"The assassination of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia in 1975 did not directly cause the creation of Saudi Aramco.  Saudi Aramco's origins trace back much further, to the early 20th century with the Standard Oil Company of California's (SOCAL) involvement in oil exploration and production in Saudi Arabia.  While the assassination was a significant event in Saudi history, it wasn't the impetus for the company's founding.

Answer: {false}
"
1849,Could a Diwali celebration feature a crustacean?,"Diwali is a festival of lights celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and some Buddhists.  There are no religious restrictions against eating crustaceans, and many celebratory meals include a wide variety of foods.  Therefore, it's entirely possible, and even likely, that a crustacean could be part of a Diwali celebration.

Answer: {true}
"
1850,Did goddess Friday is named after despise felines?,"The question is based on a false premise. There is no known goddess named Friday.  The name ""Friday"" is derived from the Norse goddess Frigg, not from any association with a dislike of felines. Therefore, the statement ""goddess Friday is named after despise felines"" is false.

Answer: {false}
"
1851,Can soup be eaten with the hands?,"Some soups, particularly those with thick consistencies like chowders or stews, can be eaten with a spoon, fork, or even bread to soak up the broth.  However, thin broths or clear soups are generally considered inappropriate to eat with hands.  Therefore, the answer depends on the type of soup.

Answer: {false}

"
1853,Would Eric Clapton's mother hypothetically be unable to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth?,"Eric Clapton was born in 1945.  The legal smoking age in the United States has varied over time, but it was significantly lower in 1945 than it is today.  While the exact legal smoking age in every US state in 1945 would require further research, it's highly unlikely that it was 21. Therefore, even if his mother was a minor, it wouldn't automatically prevent her from legally purchasing cigarettes.

Answer: {false}
"
1854,Did Secretariat win a Formula One championship?,"Secretariat was a thoroughbred racehorse, famous for his exceptional speed and Triple Crown victory in 1973. Formula One is a motor racing championship for open-wheel single-seater cars.  These are completely different sports.  Therefore, Secretariat could not have won a Formula One championship.

1855,Would Iggy Pop travel with Justin Bieber?,"Iggy Pop and Justin Bieber are both musicians, but they represent very different genres and styles of music.  Their musical tastes and overall personas are vastly different. While it's not impossible that they could meet, it's highly improbable they would travel together.  There's no known relationship or collaboration between them to suggest such a trip.

Answer: {false}
"
1856,Would Eminem perform well at the International Mathematical Olympiad?,"Eminem is a highly successful rapper and songwriter, known for his lyrical skills and musical talent.

1857,Could Godzilla have been killed by the Tohoku earthquake?,"Godzilla is a fictional giant monster.  The Tohoku earthquake, while devastating, was a real-world event.  Real-world events cannot affect fictional characters. Therefore, the Tohoku earthquake could not have killed Godzilla.

Answer: {false}
"
1858,Could you watch all of JAG in six months?,"To determine if it's possible to watch all of JAG in six months, we need to know the total runtime of the series.  JAG ran for 10 seasons, with approximately 22 episodes per season.  This totals roughly 220 episodes.  Assuming an average episode length of 44 minutes (including commercials), the total runtime would be approximately 96,800 minutes.  

Converting this to hours, we get 1613.33 hours.  Six months has approximately 180 days.  If we assume someone watches JAG for 9 hours a day, that’s 1620 hours in six months. This is more than the total runtime of the show.  However, this assumes consistent viewing every day without breaks.  Realistic viewing habits, including interruptions and time for other activities, would make it a tighter timeframe.  It's plausible, but requires a significant time commitment.


Answer: {true}
"
1859,Is the Greek alphabet as common as Sumerian cuneiform?,"The Greek alphabet is still in use today and forms the basis of many modern alphabets.  Sumerian cuneiform, however, is an ancient writing system that is no longer used. While cuneiform is historically significant, its use is limited to academic and historical study.  The widespread use and continued relevance of the Greek alphabet far surpasses that of Sumerian cuneiform.

Answer: {false}
"
1860,Does selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pay for a year at Columbia University?,"Explanation:

To determine if selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pays for a year at Columbia University, we need to compare the price of a used 2020 Corvette to the cost of tuition and fees at Columbia University for one academic year.

A quick search reveals that the price of a used 2020 Chevrolet Corvette varies greatly depending on condition, mileage, and trim level.  However, a reasonable estimate for a used 2020 Corvette might range from $50,000 to $70,000.

Columbia University's tuition and fees for the 2023-2024 academic year were approximately $65,000.  While this will vary slightly from year to year, it provides a relevant benchmark.  Adding additional expenses like room and board would significantly increase the total cost of attendance.

Comparing the potential sale price of the Corvette ($50,000-$70,000) to Columbia's tuition ($65,000), it's clear that selling a 2020 Corvette would not *almost* pay for a year at Columbia University. It would cover a significant portion, but not nearly all of the costs.

Answer: {false}
"
1861,Could all Tahiti hotels hypothetically accommodate US D-Day troops?,"The number of US D-Day troops is estimated to be around 156,000.  To determine if all Tahiti hotels could hypothetically accommodate this many troops, we need to consider the total capacity of all hotels in Tahiti.  This information is not readily available and would require extensive research to obtain an accurate figure. Even if this data were available,  it's highly unlikely that the total hotel capacity in Tahiti would come close to 156,000 people.  Hotels are designed for individual guests or small groups, not mass troop deployments, and even if they could accommodate the number of people, providing adequate amenities, logistics, and security for such a large force would be a huge undertaking.  Therefore, it's safe to assume the total capacity is far less than the number of D-Day troops.

Answer: {false}

1864,Is Edward Snowden in hiding from the United States?,"Edward Snowden leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013.  He was charged with espionage and theft of government property by the US government and subsequently fled to Hong Kong, and then to Russia, where he was granted asylum. He remains in Russia to avoid prosecution in the United States.  Therefore, he is in hiding from the United States.

Answer: {true}
"
1865,Do Leafhoppers compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources?,"Leafhoppers are insects that feed on plant sap. Log Cabin syrup is made from maple sap.  While both utilize plant sap as a resource, they do so in completely different ways and at different scales. Leafhoppers are tiny insects that consume small amounts of sap from individual plants. Log Cabin syrup producers tap maple trees to collect large amounts of sap, which is then processed into syrup.  There is no direct competition between these two.  They don't compete for the same sap sources in a way that would impact each other.

Answer: {false}
"
1866,Is euphoria associated with drug addiction?,"Euphoria is a feeling of intense pleasure or happiness. Many addictive drugs trigger the release of dopamine in the brain, producing feelings of euphoria. This pleasurable experience reinforces the drug-seeking behavior, making it difficult to stop using the substance.  Therefore, euphoria is strongly associated with drug addiction, acting as a primary positive reinforcer.

"
1868,Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?,"Edgar Allan Poe's works were not widely popular or financially successful during his lifetime.  He struggled financially throughout his life and died in poverty.  Therefore, proofreading his works would not have been a lucrative endeavor at the time.  While his works are incredibly valuable and lucrative now, posthumously, this was not the case during his life.

Answer: {false}
"
1869,Is capturing giant squid in natural habitat impossible with no gear?,"Giant squid are deep-sea creatures inhabiting extreme depths where human access is severely limited.  Even with specialized equipment, capturing a giant squid is incredibly difficult.  Attempting it without any gear would be virtually impossible due to the depth, pressure, and the squid's size and elusiveness.  There's no way to reasonably approach, capture, or restrain such an animal without specialized equipment.

Answer: {true}
"
1870,Would the author of Little Women have remembered the ratification of the 13th Amendment?,"Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Women, was born in 1832 and died in 1888.  The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, abolishing slavery, was ratified in December 1865.  Since Alcott lived well into the post-Civil War era, she would have been an adult at the time of the 13th Amendment's ratification and would have been aware of this significant historical event.

Answer: {false}
"
1872,Does Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday 13th number of projects?,"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of Dragon Ball projects (shows and movies) to the number of Friday the 13th projects.  Finding precise numbers for all Dragon Ball adaptations (including OVAs, specials, etc.) can be challenging due to differing definitions of ""project"" and variations in available data sources. Similarly, counting all Friday the 13th installments (films, TV shows, games etc.) requires careful consideration of what constitutes a ""project.""  However, it is widely known that the Friday the 13th franchise is significantly larger than the Dragon Ball franchise in terms of the number of films, TV series, and other media.  Even with a generous count of Dragon Ball projects, the Friday the 13th franchise greatly surpasses it.

Answer: {true}
"
1873,Would drinking a glass of lemonade provide Vitamin C?,"Lemonade is typically made from lemons, water, and sugar.  Lemons are a good source of Vitamin C. Therefore, drinking a glass of lemonade would provide some amount of Vitamin C, although the exact amount depends on the concentration of lemon juice in the lemonade.

"
1874,Does Bombyx mori have a monopoly over silk production?,"Bombyx mori, the silkworm, is the primary source of silk used commercially.  However, other insects also produce silk, although not on the same scale or with the same desirable qualities.  Therefore, while Bombyx mori dominates silk production, it does not hold a complete monopoly.

"
1875,Did the crew of Apollo 15 take pictures of Mount Sharp?,"The Apollo 15 mission landed on the Moon in 1971.  Mount Sharp is a mountain on Mars, and images of it were not taken until much later by rovers such as Curiosity, which landed in 2012.  Therefore, the Apollo 15 crew could not have taken pictures of Mount Sharp.

Therefore, bringing your own reusable bags is encouraged to avoid this extra cost and aligns with their environmentally conscious approach.

Answer: {true}
"
1877,Could a Porsche 992 Turbo S defeat Usain Bolt in a 100 meter sprint?,"A Porsche 992 Turbo S has a 0-60 mph time of around 2.5 seconds and a top speed exceeding 200 mph.  Usain Bolt's world record 100-meter sprint time is approximately 9.58 seconds.  While the car's acceleration is significantly faster, the 100-meter sprint requires both acceleration and sustained speed.  The car would need time to reach its top speed, and even then, it's questionable whether it could maintain that speed over the short distance, dealing with acceleration and braking at the start and finish line.  Given the reaction time needed for the driver, and potential delays in launching the car, it is unlikely a Porsche 992 Turbo S could beat Usain Bolt in a 100-meter sprint.

Answer: {false}
"
1878,Are the brooms from curling good for using on house floors?,"Curling brooms, while designed for sweeping ice, are not suitable for cleaning house floors.  Their bristles are stiff and designed to propel ice, not to effectively pick up dust or debris from a variety of surfaces.  Furthermore, the use of a curling broom on a floor could potentially scratch or damage the flooring material.

Answer: {false}
"
1879,Does having lip piercings lead to more expensive dental bills?,"Answer: Lip piercings can increase the risk of various dental problems.  The jewelry itself can chip or crack teeth, and the piercing site can be prone to infection which could spread to the gums or other oral tissues, leading to gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis), abscesses, and other issues requiring expensive dental treatment.  In addition, the constant rubbing of the jewelry against the teeth can cause enamel erosion.  Addressing these issues often requires professional dental care, resulting in higher dental bills compared to someone without lip piercings.

1880,Is ABBA's 1970's genre still relevant today?,"Explanation:
ABBA's music from the 1970s, characterized by disco-pop and catchy melodies, continues to resonate with audiences today.  Their songs are frequently played on radio stations, featured in films and commercials, and enjoyed by multiple generations.  While musical styles have evolved, ABBA's enduring popularity and the continued relevance of their music demonstrates its ongoing cultural significance.  Their music transcends its original era.

Answer: {true}
"
1881,Is J.D. Salinger's most successful work influential to killers?,"J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" has been cited in connection with several high-profile killings and violent acts.  While it's inaccurate to say the book *directly* influenced these individuals, its themes of alienation, rebellion, and disillusionment resonate with some troubled individuals. Holden Caulfield's character, with his anger and rejection of societal norms, has been interpreted by some as a figure of identification for individuals who commit violence.  It's important to note, however, that correlation does not equal causation, and many other factors contribute to violent behavior.  The book's impact is complex and should not be oversimplified to a direct causal link to criminal acts.

Answer: {true}
"
1882,Would Cyndi Lauper use milk substitute in her rice pudding?,"Cyndi Lauper is a vegan.  Vegans do not consume dairy products.  Rice pudding traditionally contains milk. Therefore, a vegan like Cyndi Lauper would likely use a milk substitute in her rice pudding.

"
1884,Was Gandalf present at the death of Eomer?,"The death of Éomer is not described in Tolkien's works.  While Éomer is a prominent character in *The Lord of the Rings*, he survives the events of the story.  Therefore, Gandalf could not have been present at his death, as it never occurred within the narrative.

Answer: {false}
"
1885,Is there a full Neptunian orbit between the first two burials of women in the Panthéon?,"The first woman buried in the Panthéon was Marie Curie in 1995.  The second was Simone Veil in 2018.  To determine if a full Neptunian orbit occurred between these dates, we need to know the orbital period of Neptune.  Neptune's orbital period is approximately 165 years.

The time between the two burials is 2018 - 1995 = 23 years.

Since 23 years is significantly less than 165 years, a full Neptunian orbit did not occur between the first two burials of women in the Panthéon.

Answer: {false}
"
1886,Are you more likely to find bipolar disorder in a crowd than diabetes?,"Explanation:

The prevalence of bipolar disorder and diabetes varies significantly.  Diabetes is a far more common condition than bipolar disorder. While exact figures depend on the population studied and diagnostic criteria used, diabetes affects a much larger percentage of the population globally.  Therefore, it's far more probable to encounter someone with diabetes in a random crowd than someone with bipolar disorder.

Answer: {true}
"
1891,Can the theory of cultural hegemony explain global warming?,"The theory of cultural hegemony, as developed by Antonio Gramsci, posits that the dominant class maintains power not just through force, but also through ideological control.  This is achieved by shaping the prevailing cultural values, beliefs, and norms in a way that makes the existing social order seem natural and inevitable.  This subtle form of control prevents subordinate groups from challenging the status quo.

Global warming, however, is a scientific phenomenon driven by verifiable physical processes. While cultural factors undoubtedly play a role in how societies respond to and mitigate climate change (e.g., denialism, resistance to policy changes), the underlying cause isn't a matter of ideological dominance. The scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports anthropogenic climate change, irrespective of prevailing cultural narratives.  While hegemonic forces might hinder effective action or delay necessary changes, they don't explain the fundamental scientific reality of the problem.  Therefore, while cultural hegemony might influence *responses* to global warming, it doesn't explain the *cause* of global warming itself.

1894,Can you drown in a Swan Lake performance?,"Swan Lake is a ballet performance, typically performed on a stage.  While there might be a set depicting a lake, it's not a real body of water deep enough to drown in.  Therefore, drowning during a Swan Lake performance is highly improbable.

Answer: {false}
"
1895,Do Armenians tend to dislike System of a Down?,"System of a Down is an Armenian-American rock band.  While there might be individual Armenians who dislike their music for personal reasons, it's highly unlikely that Armenians as a whole tend to dislike the band, especially given their cultural significance and the band members' prominent Armenian heritage.  In fact, the band's popularity and the positive reception of their music among many Armenians is more likely.

Answer: {false}
"
1896,Can the Powerpuff Girls form a complete tag team wrestling match?,"The Powerpuff Girls consist of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.  A standard tag team wrestling match requires two teams of two wrestlers each.  Since there are only three Powerpuff Girls, they cannot form two teams of two. Therefore, they cannot form a complete tag team wrestling match.

Answer: {false}
"
1897,Can you listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year?,"To determine if one could listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year, we need to estimate the total playtime of the catalog and compare it to the total time available in a year.

Let's make some assumptions:

* **Number of songs:**  The iTunes catalog contains millions of songs.  Let's assume, for a very rough estimate, there are 100 million songs.  This is likely a significant underestimate, but it provides a starting point.
* **Average song length:** The average song length is approximately 3 minutes (180 seconds).  This is a reasonable average, although some songs are much shorter and some much longer.
* **Total playtime:** 100,000,000 songs * 180 seconds/song = 18,000,000,000 seconds.

Now let's convert this to years:

* Seconds in a minute: 60
* Minutes in an hour: 60
* Hours in a day: 24
* Days in a year: 365
* Total seconds in a year: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 = 31,536,000 seconds

Finally, let's compare the total playtime to the time available in a year:

* 18,000,000,000 seconds / 31,536,000 seconds/year ≈ 570 years

Even with a substantial underestimate of the number of songs, it's clear that listening to the entire iTunes catalog in one year is impossible.

1900,Would WWF be angrier if you killed koala instead of black swan?,"The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is a conservation organization that aims to protect endangered species.  Both koalas and black swans are animals under some level of threat, but koalas are currently classified as vulnerable while black swans are classified as least concern.  The WWF's anger would likely be proportionally related to the conservation status of the animal killed.  Since koalas are more endangered, killing a koala would likely elicit a stronger negative reaction from the WWF than killing a black swan.

1912,Would Franz Ferdinand have survived with armadillo armor?,"Answer: Armadillo armor, while offering a degree of protection, is unlikely to have been effective against the type of weaponry used in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  The assassination involved high-velocity bullets fired at close range.  While armadillo plates might deflect some lower-velocity projectiles or shrapnel, they would likely not withstand the penetration power of the bullets used.  Therefore, it is highly improbable that armadillo armor would have saved Franz Ferdinand.

"
1913,Do restaurants associate meatballs with the wrong country of origin?,"Meatballs are a dish found in many cuisines around the world, with variations in ingredients and preparation methods.  While often associated with Italian-American cuisine in the United States, meatballs exist in numerous cultures, including Swedish kötbullar, Greek keftedes, and many others.  The idea of a single ""correct"" country of origin for meatballs is inaccurate.  Therefore, the association of meatballs with a single, potentially incorrect, country of origin is a common misconception.

Answer: {true}
"
1914,Will the torso be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in body?,"The largest bone in the body is the femur (thigh bone), and the smallest is the stapes (in the middle ear).  Blows to the femur could potentially cause damage that affects the torso, especially if the force is transmitted up the leg.  However, blows to the stapes are unlikely to directly impact the torso. The stapes is a small bone involved in hearing and located deep within the ear, so even a blow to that area probably won't cause torso damage.

Therefore, while blows to the femur could potentially endanger the torso, blows to the stapes almost certainly wouldn't.  The torso's safety depends heavily on the location and force of the blow to the femur.

"
1922,Would an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility result in a supersonic shock wave?,"Explanation:

The speed of a shock wave depends on the energy released and the medium through which it travels.  While a large explosion like that of a gunpowder storage facility would certainly generate a powerful shockwave, whether or not it would be supersonic depends on several factors:

* **Amount of Gunpowder:** The sheer quantity of gunpowder exploding directly influences the energy released. A larger explosion would have a higher chance of creating a supersonic shockwave.
* **Confinement:** The degree to which the explosion is contained will influence the pressure and speed of the resulting shockwave. A confined explosion is more likely to produce a supersonic wave than an unconfined one.
* **Atmospheric Conditions:**  Temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere all affect the speed of sound, and thus the speed needed to be supersonic.

While a large enough explosion *could* generate a supersonic shockwave, it's not guaranteed.  The speed of the shockwave needs to exceed the speed of sound in the surrounding air, and that's dependent on the variables listed above.  It's quite possible a powerful explosion could result in a very fast, powerful shockwave that is *not* supersonic.

Answer: {false}
"
1923,"At midnight in Times Square on New Years Eve, are you likely to meet people in diapers?","Explanation:
New Year's Eve in Times Square is a massive public event with a huge crowd of people celebrating.

"
1937,Did number of Imams Reza Shah believed in exceed number of Jesus's disciples?,"Explanation:
We need to determine the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in and the number of Jesus's disciples.

* **Jesus's disciples:** The number of Jesus's disciples is generally considered to be twelve, based on the New Testament.  There's some debate and interpretation about the exact number and who counts as a disciple, but twelve is the commonly accepted figure.

* **Imams Reza Shah believed in:** Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, was a secular ruler who did not outwardly believe in a specific number of Imams in the same way religious individuals might.  The Shia Islamic faith, dominant in Iran, believes in twelve Imams.  It's highly unlikely Reza Shah actively believed in or promoted a particular number of Imams beyond the established Shia belief. While he may have tolerated or used the religious framework for political purposes, a specific personal belief in a number of Imams beyond the twelve is not supported by historical record.

Therefore, the number of Imams Reza Shah implicitly or tacitly acknowledged (12) is not greater than the generally accepted number of Jesus's disciples (12).

1949,Are red legs a sign of failing health in those with Anorexia Nervosa?,"Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by an extremely low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image.  People with anorexia often restrict their food intake severely, leading to malnutrition and a variety of physical consequences.  One of these consequences can be the development of ""red legs,"" or petechiae and purpura, which are small, pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots on the skin. These are caused by a deficiency in platelets (thrombocytopenia) due to malnutrition.  The lack of nutrients impairs the body's ability to produce platelets, which are essential for blood clotting. When the platelet count is low, tiny blood vessels can break easily, resulting in the appearance of red spots on the legs and other areas of the body.  This is a serious sign indicating the severe nutritional deficiencies associated with advanced anorexia nervosa and a risk of internal bleeding.

1969,Can a software engineer work during a power outage?,"The ability of a software engineer to work during a power outage depends heavily on the type of work they are doing and the resources available to them.

If the work involves tasks that require access to a computer and internet connection, a power outage would significantly hinder, if not entirely prevent, the engineer from working.  Many software development tasks depend on electricity to run computers, servers, and network infrastructure.

However, if the engineer's tasks involve offline work such as planning, designing, reviewing documentation, or writing code on paper that can be later transcribed, then a power outage might pose less of a significant problem.

Therefore, a definitive yes or no answer is inaccurate.  It depends on the specific nature of the software engineer's work.

1979,Could a wandering albatross fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest?,"Wandering albatrosses are known for their incredible endurance and ability to glide for long distances without flapping their wings.  However, the distance between Bucharest, Romania and New York City is approximately 4,500 miles.  While a wandering albatross has a phenomenal wingspan and can cover vast distances, it's highly unlikely that it could fly this far non-stop.  They need to land to rest and feed.

1980,Will Chuck Norris be a nonagenarian by time next leap year after 2020 happens?,"Chuck Norris was born on March 10, 1940.  The next leap year after 2020 was 2024.  To determine if he would be a nonagenarian (90 years or older) by 2024, we calculate his age in 2024: 2024 - 1940 = 84 years old.  Since 84 is less than 90, he would not be a nonagenarian by 2024.

"
1981,Would a German Shepherd be welcome in an airport?,"Answer:  Emotional support animals and service animals are generally permitted in airports, subject to airline and airport regulations.  While a German Shepherd isn't automatically excluded, its acceptance depends on whether it's a certified service animal or an emotional support animal with proper documentation.  Many airports have restrictions on the size and type of animals allowed. While some German Shepherds might be accepted, others might not be.  Therefore, the answer cannot be definitively true or false without more information.

1983,Do Do It Yourself channels online always show realistic projects?,"DIY channels online vary widely in their approach to project realism.  Some channels focus on highly achievable projects with readily available materials, clearly demonstrating each step. Others might showcase more ambitious projects, potentially glossing over challenging steps or difficulties, or using specialized tools and materials not easily accessible to the average viewer.  Some may even stage parts of the project for visual appeal or to compress the time involved. Therefore, it's inaccurate to claim *all* DIY channels show realistic projects.

1989,Could all the unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression fit in Tiger Stadium?,"To determine if all the unemployed people during the Great Depression could fit in Tiger Stadium, we need to estimate both the number of unemployed and the capacity of Tiger Stadium.

* **Unemployed in 1933:**  The unemployment rate in the US during the Great Depression's peak (around 1933) was approximately 25%.  The US population at that time was roughly 125 million.  Therefore, a rough estimate of the unemployed would be 25% of 125 million, or approximately 31.25 million people.

* **Tiger Stadium Capacity:** The capacity of Tiger Stadium (in Detroit, Michigan) varies depending on the configuration, but a reasonable estimate is around 40,000 people.

* **Comparison:**  31.25 million unemployed people is far greater than the 40,000 capacity of Tiger Stadium.  Even considering multiple games or events, it's clear that all unemployed Americans from 1933 couldn't fit into Tiger Stadium.

1992,Is the Mona Lisa based on a real person?,"The Mona Lisa's identity has been a subject of much debate and speculation throughout history. While there's no definitive proof, the most widely accepted theory is that the painting is a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant.  Historical documents and art historical analysis lend credence to this theory, although some alternative hypotheses exist.  The weight of evidence, however, strongly suggests a real person served as the model.

Answer: {true}
"
1993,Would a model be likely to frequently enjoy the menu at Cookout?,"Answer: Cookout is a fast-food restaurant chain known for its affordable, casual menu items such as burgers, barbecue, and milkshakes.

1997,Could Durian cause someone's stomach to feel unwell?,"Durian is a fruit known for its pungent odor and strong, sometimes overpowering, taste.  Many people find the smell and taste unpleasant, and consuming it can lead to digestive upset in some individuals.  This is because durian is high in fat and fiber, and its unique chemical composition can be difficult for some digestive systems to process.  This can result in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Therefore, it is plausible that durian could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell.

While the major phases of fighting spanned roughly a century, it wasn't a single, unbroken war.

Answer: {true}
"
1999,"For bone growth, is kale more beneficial than spinach?","Both kale and spinach are leafy green vegetables packed with nutrients beneficial for bone health.  However, kale generally surpasses spinach in certain key areas relevant to bone growth.  Kale boasts a higher concentration of vitamin K, crucial for bone metabolism and calcium absorption.  While both are good sources of calcium, kale often contains more.  Furthermore, kale provides a greater amount of vitamin A, which plays a role in bone growth and development, although it's worth noting that excessive vitamin A can be detrimental.  Spinach contains more oxalates, which can hinder calcium absorption.

While spinach offers nutritional benefits, the higher levels of vitamin K, calcium, and vitamin A in kale generally make it slightly more beneficial for bone growth.  It's important to note that a balanced diet incorporating diverse vegetables is key for optimal bone health.

2004,Did Mike Tyson do something very different than McGruff's slogan to Evander Holyfield in 1997?,"McGruff's slogan, ""Take a Bite Out of Crime,"" promotes crime prevention.  Mike Tyson, in his 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield, bit off a significant portion of Holyfield's ear. This action is a violent crime, the antithesis of crime prevention.  Therefore, Mike Tyson's actions were very different from the message of McGruff's slogan.

"
2010,Can French Defence initial move defend against four move checkmate?,"The four-move checkmate, also known as the ""Fool's Mate,"" relies on a specific sequence of moves.  It's a very basic checkmate that only occurs if White makes a series of incredibly poor moves.  Because it is so basic, almost any opening move for Black would prevent it.  French Defence is a solid opening; Black's first move, 1...e6, immediately controls the center of the board and does not leave the king vulnerable in the way required for the Fool's Mate. Therefore, the French Defence's initial move easily prevents the four-move checkmate.

2012,Is grief always obvious when it is being experienced?,"Grief manifests in diverse ways, both outwardly visible and internally processed. While some individuals exhibit overt signs like crying, withdrawal, or anger, others may experience grief more subtly, with muted emotional responses or a stoic exterior.  The expression of grief is deeply personal and influenced by cultural norms, individual coping mechanisms, and the nature of the loss itself. Therefore, the outward display of grief is not a reliable indicator of its presence or intensity.

2018,Could someone listen to the entire U2 debut studio album during an episode of Peppa Pig?,"Explanation:

To determine if a listener could listen to the entirety of U2's debut album, *Boy*, during a single episode of Peppa Pig, we need to estimate the length of a typical Peppa Pig episode and the length of the album.

A typical Peppa Pig episode is approximately 5 minutes long.  The album *Boy* has a running time of roughly 42 minutes.  Since 42 minutes is significantly longer than 5 minutes, it is impossible to listen to the entire album during a single Peppa Pig episode.

2020,Did Jerry Seinfeld have reason to cheer in 1986?,"Explanation:
To determine if Jerry Seinfeld had reason to cheer in 1986, we need to consider significant events in his life and career around that year.  1986 is particularly relevant because it marks a crucial point in his journey to comedic success.  ""Seinfeld,"" the television show that made him famous, did not premiere until 1989. However, 1986 was likely a year of building momentum.  He was already a stand-up comedian, and his appearances and work in the years leading up to the creation of his successful show would suggest cause for celebration.

2021,Could Buzz Aldrin have owned a computer?,"Buzz Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 mission that landed on the moon in 1969.  While personal computers as we know them today did not exist in 1969, computers did exist.  Mainframe computers and early minicomputers were in use during this time, and it's plausible that a wealthy or prominent individual like Buzz Aldrin could have had access to, or even owned, such a machine, either for personal use or for his work in the space program.  Therefore, it's reasonably possible he owned a computer.

2022,Do urban legends always have to occur in cities?,"The term ""urban legend"" refers to a story that is widely believed to be true but is actually false.  The setting of the story—whether it's a city, town, or rural area—is not a defining characteristic of what makes it an urban legend.  Many stories considered urban legends take place in rural settings or involve ambiguous locations.  The key element is that the story is fictional, widely circulated, and believed by many to be true.

2023,Is Gandalf hypothetically a formidable foe for Charmed's Barbas?,"Gandalf, from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, is a powerful wizard with immense magical abilities, vast experience in combat, and access to powerful artifacts.  He has demonstrated the ability to overcome formidable foes with both magical prowess and strategic thinking.

Barbas, from the television show Charmed, is a powerful demon with shapeshifting abilities and considerable magical power. However, his power is largely limited to the context of the Charmed universe and its established rules.  While powerful within that framework, he's unlikely to possess the same breadth and depth of power, experience, or magical versatility as Gandalf.  

Considering Gandalf's demonstrated power across a wide range of threats and his inherent wisdom and strategic capabilities, it's highly probable he would be able to defeat Barbas.

Basil is a common ingredient in many Italian dishes, and its absence could potentially disrupt the preparation of several menu items. While a chef would likely find a substitute or adjust the menu, the absence of a key ingredient would probably cause some level of concern or stress.  Therefore, while not necessarily a complete panic, some level of concern is likely.

2030,Could you windsurf in Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria?,"Hurricane Maria was a catastrophic Category 4 hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017.  The intense winds, torrential rain, and storm surge associated with a hurricane of that magnitude would make windsurfing extremely dangerous, if not impossible.  The high winds would make controlling a windsurf board incredibly difficult, and the rough seas and potential for debris would present significant safety risks.  Furthermore, the widespread damage to infrastructure likely made access to suitable windsurfing locations impossible.

The United States Air Force values adherence to rules, regulations, and a strong moral code.  A history of lawbreaking and disregard for authority would be considered disqualifying for any position within the Air Force, particularly considering the sensitive nature of the roles within the branch. Therefore, Han Solo's character traits would make him a poor candidate for the Air Force.

2042,Would a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer be shunned by their Amish cousins?,"The Amish community has very strict rules regarding dress and appearance. Their clothing is plain and simple, avoiding ornamentation or extravagance.  A Dolce & Gabbana suit is known for its high fashion, luxurious fabrics, and often elaborate designs. This stark contrast in style would almost certainly lead to disapproval and likely shunning within the Amish community.  Their emphasis on humility and avoiding worldly display would make the wearer of such a suit stand out significantly, violating their communal norms.

2047,Would Benito Mussolini hypothetically play well in the NBA?,"Benito Mussolini was a famously short, stocky man.  Height and athleticism are significant advantages in professional basketball.  While his physical attributes would have likely hindered his NBA prospects significantly, this is a hypothetical question and therefore doesn't require a strict analysis of other factors, like skill level.  The question asks whether he would play ""well"". This is a subjective term.  It is highly unlikely he would ever make an NBA roster, or even a college team, due to his physical limitations. However, he might be a good manager, or contribute to the team in other ways, even if his on-court performance is poor.

"
2050,Are coopers required in the beverage industry?,"Coopers are skilled craftspeople who make and repair barrels.  While barrels were historically essential for storing and transporting many beverages, especially alcoholic ones, modern beverage production relies heavily on other methods like stainless steel tanks and other more efficient and sanitary containers.  Though some breweries and distilleries might still use wooden barrels for aging or specific flavor profiles, it is not a universal requirement across the entire beverage industry. Therefore, coopers are not required in the beverage industry as a whole.

Answer: {true}
"
2052,Can a student from Smithtown's Cleary School understand the speech of a French person?,"The question asks whether a student from Smithtown's Cleary School can understand the speech of a French person.  This depends entirely on whether that student has learned French. There's no inherent reason why a student at that school would or wouldn't know French.  The location of the school or its name provides no information about its curriculum.  Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question definitively.

"
2054,Did Terry Pratchett write about quantum mechanics?,"Terry Pratchett's Discworld series is known for its satirical and humorous take on various aspects of life and society, often incorporating elements of fantasy, science fiction, and mythology.  While Pratchett wasn't known for directly tackling complex scientific concepts like quantum mechanics in a rigorous manner, his writing frequently touched upon related themes such as probability, chance, and the nature of reality in a metaphorical and often comical way.  He might use these concepts as a backdrop for his stories or weave them into his characters' actions and situations, but he wouldn't delve into the intricate mathematical and scientific details of quantum mechanics.  Therefore, while there might be instances where concepts loosely reminiscent of quantum mechanics appear in his work, he didn't write *about* it in a directly explanatory or scientific manner.

Answer: {false}
"

"
2056,Could a fan of the Botany Swarm vote for John Key?,"The Botany Swarm is a New Zealand political group.  John Key was the Prime Minister of New Zealand for the National Party.  While there's no direct evidence showing a categorical incompatibility,  it's highly unlikely a dedicated supporter of a specific political group would vote for a member of a completely different party, especially one with opposing ideologies.  The Botany Swarm operates outside the traditional two-party system, suggesting their voters likely have differing political priorities than those who support the National Party.

Answer: {false}
"
2057,Could Maroon 5 have hypothetically held a concert at Roman Colosseum?,"Maroon 5 is a modern musical group.  The Roman Colosseum is an ancient structure. While modern concerts are held in ancient structures sometimes, the Colosseum's current state and restrictions would likely prevent a large-scale concert by Maroon 5.  The Colosseum is a historical site with limited capacity and strict regulations regarding its use.  A major concert like the one Maroon 5 would put on requires significant infrastructure, which is not readily available or permitted at the Colosseum.

"
2059,Would you be likely to see storks at a baby shower?,"Storks are often associated with the arrival of babies, appearing in children's stories and cartoons.  While not a common sight at baby showers, the symbolic association makes it plausible that someone might incorporate storks into the decorations or theme.  However, it's not a guaranteed or typical occurrence.

"
2060,Do hyenas appear in a Broadway musical?,"The question asks whether hyenas appear in a Broadway musical.  To answer this, we need to consider if there are any known Broadway musicals that feature hyenas as characters or significant elements of the plot.  While many Broadway musicals feature animals, it's less common to find hyenas as prominent characters.  A quick search of known Broadway musicals doesn't immediately reveal any that prominently feature hyenas.

2061,Did Millard Fillmore help to establish the University of Pittsburgh?,"Millard Fillmore's presidency ran from 1850 to 1853.  The University of Pittsburgh was founded in 1787.  Therefore, Millard Fillmore could not have helped establish the University of Pittsburgh.

Answer: {false}
"
2062,Is Christianity better for global warming than Satanism?,"Christianity and Satanism are belief systems, not organizations with unified environmental policies.  Therefore, comparing their relative effectiveness in combating global warming is inherently problematic.  While some Christian groups actively advocate for environmental stewardship based on their interpretation of biblical teachings about caring for creation, others may hold views that are less environmentally conscious. Similarly, there is no single Satanic perspective on environmental issues.  Any individual's actions regarding global warming would be determined by their personal values and choices, regardless of their religious affiliation.

Answer: {false}
"
2063,Was Robert Downey Jr. a good role model as a young man?,"Robert Downey Jr.'s early life and career were marked by significant struggles with substance abuse and legal issues.  These actions would not be considered exemplary behavior for a young person.  While he has since turned his life around and become a successful actor, his younger years offer a far from positive example for young people.

"
2064,Can you transport a coin along a sea of mercury?,"Mercury is a liquid metal.  A coin, being a solid object denser than mercury, would sink into the mercury.  Therefore, you cannot transport it *along* the surface.  You could potentially transport it *through* the mercury, but that's not the same as transporting it along the surface.

Answer: {false}
"
2065,Is Newt Gingrich's nickname a type of Reptile?,"Newt Gingrich's nickname is ""Newt.""  ""Newt"" is a common name for a type of amphibian, specifically a newt, which is a type of salamander.  Salamanders are amphibians, not reptiles.  However, the question asks if his nickname is *a type* of reptile, and while a newt isn't a reptile, the nickname itself is derived from the name of an amphibian that could be loosely considered related to reptiles in the broader sense of being ectothermic.   The question is ambiguous and could reasonably be interpreted as either true or false depending on the level of strictness applied to the definition.  Considering the loose relationship, I'll lean towards true.

Answer: {true}
"
2066,Did Christopher Columbus break the fifth commandment in Christianity?,"Explanation:
The fifth commandment in Christianity is ""Honor thy father and thy mother.""  While there's no direct evidence of Columbus directly disobeying this commandment in a way that's easily definable, his actions could be interpreted as a violation depending on one's perspective.  He left his family and pursued his goals across the ocean for extended periods, neglecting his familial duties for the sake of his ambition.   Furthermore, some would argue that his actions towards the indigenous populations of the Americas, characterized by violence, exploitation, and disregard for their lives and culture, could be seen as a violation of the spirit of the commandment by failing to honor the broader human family.  However, determining if this constitutes a definitive breaking of the commandment is subjective and depends on the interpretation.

Answer: {true}
"
2067,Can a Reconstruction era coin buy DJI Mavic Pro Drone?,"To determine if a Reconstruction-era coin could buy a DJI Mavic Pro drone, we need to consider the purchasing power of a Reconstruction-era coin and the current price of a DJI Mavic Pro drone.

Reconstruction era spanned from 1865 to 1877.  The value of a coin from that era would depend heavily on the specific coin (e.g., a gold coin would be worth far more than a copper cent).  Even the most valuable coins from that period would have significantly less purchasing power today due to inflation.  A  gold coin might be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars in collector's terms, but it wouldn't have nearly the same purchasing power as thousands of dollars today.

A DJI Mavic Pro drone costs several hundred to over a thousand dollars depending on the model and where it's purchased.


Considering the significant inflation since the Reconstruction era and the relative cost of a DJI Mavic Pro drone, it's highly unlikely that even the most valuable Reconstruction-era coin could purchase one.

Answer: {false}
"
2068,Is week old chlorine water safe to drink?,"Chlorine is added to water to kill harmful bacteria and viruses. However, chlorine dissipates over time.  Week-old chlorine water, especially if stored improperly (exposed to air and sunlight), will likely have significantly reduced chlorine levels, making it unsafe to drink.  The remaining water might still contain contaminants that were not eliminated by the initial chlorination.  Therefore, it's not safe to consume.

Answer: {true}
"
2070,Is a paraplegic suitable for conducting an orchestra?,"A paraplegic person's ability to conduct an orchestra depends entirely on the specific nature of their paralysis and their individual physical capabilities.  While paraplegia affects lower body function, it doesn't necessarily impact upper body strength, dexterity, or coordination, all of which are crucial for conducting.  Many conductors use precise and expressive arm and hand movements. Some conductors might use a chair or other assistive devices.  Therefore, it's not inherently unsuitable, but it depends on the individual.

Answer: {true}
"
2071,Can 1980 United States presidential election result be considered a photo finish?,"The 1980 United States presidential election saw Ronald Reagan win a landslide victory over incumbent Jimmy Carter.  Reagan won 44 states to Carter's 6, and secured 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49.  This was not a close election; the margin of victory was substantial.  A ""photo finish"" implies an extremely close result where the winner is difficult to determine without careful scrutiny.  The 1980 election was clearly not a photo finish.

Answer: {false}
"
2072,Is a fever cured by listening to a cowbell?,"Answer: A fever is a symptom of an underlying illness, typically caused by infection.  Listening to a cowbell has no scientifically proven effect on the underlying cause or symptoms of a fever.  Therefore, listening to a cowbell would not cure a fever.

Answer: {false}
"
2073,Can a single honey bee sting multiple humans?,"A honeybee's stinger is barbed.  When a honeybee stings a human, the stinger becomes embedded in the skin, along with the venom sac and some of the bee's internal organs.  This action fatally injures the bee, resulting in its death.  Therefore, a single honeybee can only sting once.

Answer: {false}
"
2074,Could Bob Marley's children hypothetically win tug of war against Kublai Khan's children?,"Bob Marley had many children, and it's likely that at least some of them would be strong adults capable of participating in a tug-of-war.  Kublai Khan lived centuries ago, so his children would be long deceased.  Therefore, Bob Marley's adult children would have a significant advantage in a tug-of-war against Kublai Khan's descendants (who would be of unknown strength and number).

Answer: {true}
"
2075,Did Harry Houdini's wife make psychics look foolish?,"Explanation:
Bess Houdini, Harry Houdini's wife, was a vocal skeptic of spiritualism and psychics.  After her husband's death, she actively worked to expose fraudulent mediums who claimed to contact him.  Her efforts to debunk these claims, often using her knowledge of Houdini's escape techniques and showmanship, led to many psychics being revealed as frauds.

"
2077,Do some home remedies result in your skin color turning blue?,"Several home remedies, particularly those involving the ingestion or topical application of certain substances, can lead to a bluish discoloration of the skin, also known as cyanosis.  This is typically not a desirable outcome and indicates a problem.  For instance, some herbal remedies or improperly prepared metallic compounds can cause this effect.  The blue coloration is a result of a reduced oxygen level in the blood.  While rare, it's a potential side effect of using unverified or unsafe home remedies.

Answer: {true}
"
2078,Did the Berlin Wall prevent any athletes from competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics?,"The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany.

"
2079,Is Batman (1989 film) likely to be shown on flight from NY to Kansas City?,"In-flight entertainment selections vary by airline and flight duration.  While longer flights are more likely to have a wider selection of movies including older titles like Batman (1989), it's not guaranteed.  Shorter flights may have limited choices, focusing on newer releases. Therefore, it's not certain whether Batman (1989) would be available on a flight from New York to Kansas City.

Answer: {false}
"
2080,Has Don King killed more people than Charles Manson did with his own hands in 1971?,"Explanation:
To answer this question, we need to determine the number of people Don King and Charles Manson killed with their own hands in 1971.  Information on Don King's direct involvement in killings is not readily available through reliable sources.  While he has a controversial past and has been accused of various crimes, there's no widely accepted evidence that he personally killed anyone.  Conversely, while Charles Manson did not directly kill anyone during the Tate-LaBianca murders in 1969, he orchestrated the killings, leading to his conviction.  The question asks about 1971, and neither individual is definitively known to have killed anyone with their own hands in that year.  Therefore, comparing their direct kills in 1971 is impossible due to a lack of evidence linking Don King to any such acts.

Answer: {false}
"
2081,Could amoebas have played a part in the Black Death?,"The Black Death, primarily caused by *Yersinia pestis*, was spread through flea bites and potentially respiratory droplets.  Amoebas, while single-celled organisms, are not known vectors for *Yersinia pestis*.  There's no evidence to suggest amoebas played a significant role in the transmission or pathogenesis of the Black Death.  While amoebas can harbor other pathogens, there's no established link to the plague bacterium.

2084,Could the Pope be on an episode of Pimp My Ride?,"The premise of ""Pimp My Ride"" is to customize and upgrade a person's car.  The Pope, as the head of the Catholic Church, is not known for owning or driving cars, let alone participating in a show focused on car modification.  While it's theoretically possible, it's highly improbable and outside the realm of reason.

Answer: {false}
"
2085,Can an African Elephant get pregnant twice in a year?,"African elephants have a gestation period of approximately 22 months.

Answer: {false}
"
2088,Is Cambodia too expensive for 2020 richest billionaire to own?,"Explanation:
The question asks whether Cambodia is too expensive for the 2020 richest billionaire to own.  This is a flawed question.  One cannot ""own"" a country.  A billionaire could, however, buy significant amounts of property within Cambodia.  The cost of purchasing all the land and assets within a country like Cambodia would be astronomically high, likely exceeding even the wealth of the richest person in 2020.  Therefore, while a billionaire could certainly afford to buy *some* property in Cambodia, the idea of ""owning"" the entire country is financially impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
2089,Will a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell balance out a giant scale?,"Here's an explanation to determine if a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell would balance on a giant scale:

To determine if they balance, we need to compare their weights.  A Holstein cow typically weighs between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds. The Liberty Bell weighs approximately 2,080 pounds.  Therefore, the Liberty Bell is significantly heavier than a Holstein cow.  They would not balance on a giant scale.

2090,Did Cleopatra have ethnicity closer to Egyptians than Greeks?,"Cleopatra VII Philopator was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great.  While she was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and ruled Egypt for decades, her family's origins were Macedonian Greek.  Therefore, her ancestry was more closely aligned with Greeks than Egyptians, despite her long reign over Egypt and her adoption of Egyptian customs and titles.

Answer: {false}
"
2091,Can ham make a cut seal up quicker?,"Ham, being a protein-rich food, contains amino acids.  Some amino acids contribute to collagen production, a key component in wound healing.  However, applying ham directly to a cut wouldn't be effective or sanitary. The process of wound healing is complex and involves multiple biological factors beyond just protein intake.  While ham might indirectly contribute to the body's overall ability to heal through its nutritional content, it cannot directly make a cut seal up faster when applied topically.

Answer: {false}
"
2092,Can COVID-19 spread to maritime pilots?,"COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  Maritime pilots, like any other human being, are susceptible to respiratory illnesses.  They come into contact with various people during their work, including crew members boarding and leaving vessels. Therefore, they are exposed to the same risks of infection as the general population.

Answer: {true}
"
2097,Is eggplant deadly to most atopic individuals?,"Eggplant, while generally safe for consumption, contains compounds that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals.  Atopic individuals are those prone to allergic diseases, and while eggplant allergies are not exceptionally common, they can occur.  Therefore, it's not accurate to say eggplant is deadly to *most* atopic individuals, as the vast majority of atopic individuals will likely not experience a life-threatening reaction.  However, it *could* be dangerous for a small subset of atopic individuals with a specific eggplant allergy.  The severity of an allergic reaction depends on the individual, the amount of eggplant consumed, and the presence of other triggering factors.

Answer: {false}
"
2098,Could you go to New York Public Library and the Six Flags Great Escape in the same day?,"To answer this question, we need to consider the locations of the New York Public Library and Six Flags Great Escape, and the travel time between them.  The New York Public Library is located in New York City. Six Flags Great Escape is located in Queensbury, New York, which is a significant distance from New York City.  The drive alone would take several hours, and this doesn't account for potential traffic delays.  Adding in the time needed to visit both locations, it's highly improbable that one could visit both in a single day.

2100,Is there radiation where Nikola Tesla once worked?,"Nikola Tesla worked in numerous locations throughout his life.  Many of these locations still exist, and some may contain residual radiation depending on the materials used and the era in which the building was constructed.  However, the presence of radiation is not a universal consequence of Tesla's work.  The question lacks specificity as to which location is being referenced and the type of radiation in question.  While some of his experiments may have involved radiation producing equipment, it is unlikely that any significant level of radiation would remain in the building today. The question lacks sufficient information to provide a definitive answer.

Answer: {false}

2103,Would Bugs Bunny harm an olive tree in the real world?,"Bugs Bunny is a cartoon character known for his antics, including eating carrots.  He does not have the physical capacity to harm an olive tree, nor would he have the motivation to do so, as his actions are primarily comedic and do not involve malicious destruction of plants.  While he might nibble on a carrot near an olive tree, this would not constitute harm to the tree itself.

Answer: {false}

Answer: {true}
"
2110,Is it understandable to compare a blood spatter pattern to a Jackson Pollock piece?,"Blood spatter analysis is a forensic technique used to interpret bloodstains at a crime scene to gain information about the events that occurred.  The patterns created by blood spatter – the size, shape, and distribution of the stains – are analyzed to determine things like the type of weapon used, the direction of impact, and the movement of the victim and/or assailant.  This creates a complex, often chaotic pattern.

Jackson Pollock's paintings are known for their abstract nature and the way he dripped and splattered paint onto the canvas, creating unpredictable and dynamic compositions.  Both blood spatter patterns and Pollock's work feature a degree of randomness and chaotic distribution of elements. While one is a violent crime scene and the other is an artistic expression, there is a superficial similarity in the visual effect of random distribution of elements across a surface.

Therefore, while not a scientifically accurate comparison for forensic analysis, a comparison between a blood spatter pattern and a Jackson Pollock painting can be made on a purely visual level, based on the commonality of randomness and unpredictable distribution.


Answer: {true}
"
2111,Can the city of Miami fit inside Uppsala?,"To determine if Miami could fit inside Uppsala, we need to compare their land areas.  Miami's area is relatively small compared to many other major cities. Uppsala, on the other hand, is a considerably larger city.  While precise comparisons require detailed mapping and accounting for irregular shapes, a simple comparison of reported land areas strongly suggests that Miami's area is significantly smaller than Uppsala's.  Therefore, Miami could theoretically fit within Uppsala's boundaries.

2113,As of 2020 have more women succeeded John Key than preceded him?,"John Key was the 38th Prime Minister of New Zealand.  To determine if more women have succeeded him than preceded him, we need to look at the Prime Ministers before and after his term.  Information readily available online shows that several women have served as Prime Minister of New Zealand since John Key left office.  Conversely, relatively few women served as Prime Minister before him. Therefore, it's highly probable that more women have succeeded John Key than preceded him.

2114,Can a microwave melt a Toyota Prius battery?,"A Toyota Prius uses a nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery or a lithium-ion battery.  Microwaves work by exciting water molecules, causing them to generate heat.  While a microwave could potentially generate enough heat to damage *some* components of a battery if they contained sufficient moisture, it's highly unlikely to melt the entire battery pack. The battery packs are designed with thermal management systems to prevent overheating, and are also quite robust.  The amount of water contained within the battery pack itself is minimal. While the plastic casing might melt or deform from prolonged exposure to microwave radiation, the battery cells themselves are unlikely to melt.

Morgan's health is a matter of historical record, and while details about specific illnesses might be sparse, it's known he suffered from various health problems throughout his life.  There's no indication suggesting he had exceptionally healthy lungs. In fact, given his lifestyle and the era in which he lived (late 19th and early 20th century), it's more likely he had some degree of lung compromise from air pollution, potential tobacco use, or other common health issues of the time.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that he had exceptionally healthy lungs.

2117,Can a wheelbarrow full of starch kill hyperglycemics?,"Explanation:
A wheelbarrow full of starch, while containing a large amount of carbohydrates which break down into glucose, would not directly kill someone with hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).  Hyperglycemia is a condition where the body has difficulty processing glucose.  While ingesting a massive amount of starch could exacerbate the condition and potentially lead to serious complications, it would not be a direct cause of death in the same way that a lethal injection might.  Death from hyperglycemia is usually a consequence of long-term effects like organ damage or diabetic ketoacidosis.  Consuming a vast amount of starch could contribute to these problems but isn't a direct and immediate cause of death.

Answer: {false}
"
2118,Could the Austrian casualties from Seven Years' War fit in Indianapolis Motor Speedway?,"To answer this question, we need to estimate the number of Austrian casualties in the Seven Years' War and the capacity of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

First, let's estimate the Austrian casualties.  The Seven Years' War (1756-1763) was a major conflict with high casualties across all participants.  While precise figures for Austrian losses are difficult to find and vary depending on the source, a reasonable estimate for total Austrian military deaths might be in the range of 100,000 to 200,000. This is a rough estimate and could be higher or lower.


Next, let's consider the capacity of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  The Speedway's capacity for spectators is generally cited as around 257,000.  However, this is for people, not bodies.  Packing bodies into a space like the Speedway would be far less efficient and wouldn't likely fill the whole area.   Even if one could somehow densely pack the bodies, 100,000-200,000 bodies would occupy a significant volume.  

Therefore, while the spectator capacity is much higher than the estimated Austrian casualties, considering the space needed for bodies compared to people, it's unlikely that all the estimated casualties could fit within the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

2122,Are right wing Amreicans opposed to marxism?,"Answer: Right-wing Americans generally adhere to ideologies that emphasize individual liberty, free markets, and limited government intervention.  Marxism, on the other hand, is a socialist ideology advocating for collective ownership of the means of production and a classless society. These core tenets are fundamentally opposed.  Therefore, right-wing Americans are typically opposed to Marxism.

Answer: {true}
"
2123,Was King Kong (2005 film) solvent?,"To determine if the 2005 King Kong film was solvent, we need to consider its budget and box office revenue.  While precise figures on profitability aren't always publicly available, we can access generally accepted data points. The film's production budget was substantial (around $200 million), and its marketing costs were also considerable. To be solvent, the film's box office revenue, along with any other revenue streams (DVD/Blu-ray sales, merchandise, etc.), needed to exceed its total costs (production plus marketing). While the film was a significant box office success, grossing over $550 million worldwide, whether it exceeded its full cost (including marketing and distribution fees, which can often equal or exceed the production budget) requires more specific financial data than is readily available to the public. Given the size of the budget, it's reasonable to assume the film achieved profitability, but it's impossible to be certain without access to internal financial documents. Therefore, while a very strong likelihood of solvency exists, we cannot definitively say it was solvent based on publicly available information.

Answer: {Probably true}
"
2124,Is growing seedless cucumber good for a gardener with entomophobia?,"Entomophobia is the fear of insects.  Seedless cucumbers are typically produced through parthenocarpy, a process that doesn't require pollination by insects.

Answer: {false}
"
2126,Do Shinto practitioners keep to a kosher diet?,"Shinto is a Japanese religion that focuses on the veneration of kami (spirits) and has no dietary restrictions comparable to kosher laws.  Kosher dietary laws, on the other hand, are specific to Judaism and govern the preparation and consumption of food.  Therefore, a Shinto practitioner would not necessarily adhere to a kosher diet.

Answer: {false}
"
2127,Does the texture of leaves remain the same independent of their coloring changing?,"Leaf texture, which refers to the surface characteristics like smoothness, roughness, hairiness, or waxy coating, is largely determined by the epidermal cells and other structures within the leaf.  These structures are not directly changed during the color change process (which is primarily due to changes in chlorophyll and other pigments). While some subtle changes might occur due to environmental factors influencing cell structure during the color change period (e.g., dehydration), the fundamental texture remains largely the same.  The visual change in color doesn't fundamentally alter the underlying physical structure that determines the texture.

Answer: {true}

2130,Does acupuncture cause pain in many people?,"Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body. While some people experience no pain or only mild discomfort, others may experience varying degrees of pain, depending on factors such as the individual's pain tolerance, the location of the needles, and the depth of insertion.  Therefore, it is inaccurate to say acupuncture *always* causes pain, nor that it *never* causes pain.  The experience is subjective and variable.

2132,"If one of your feet is in a leg cast, should the other be in a sandal?","The question asks whether wearing a sandal on the uninjured foot is advisable when the other foot is in a leg cast.  While there's no medical contraindication directly linking a cast on one foot to footwear choice on the other, practicality and comfort should be considered. A sandal offers breathability and ease of wear, which is beneficial for the uninjured foot, especially during the potentially increased activity and weight-bearing it will experience while the other foot is immobilized.  However, the best choice would depend on individual circumstances and doctor's recommendations.

Answer: {true}
"
2133,Would food made with black salt smell of sulfur?,"Black salt, also known as Kala Namak, contains sulfur compounds, specifically hydrogen sulfide, which gives it a distinct smell reminiscent of sulfur or rotten eggs.

2134,Would the average Hawaiian male experience more days on Earth compared to a wild cane toad?,"The average lifespan of a Hawaiian male is significantly longer than that of a wild cane toad.  While precise average lifespans for Hawaiian males may vary depending on the source and year of data collection, they are typically measured in decades.  Wild cane toads, on the other hand, have much shorter lifespans, usually measured in years, not decades. Therefore, a Hawaiian male will experience many more days on Earth.

Answer: {false}
"
2136,Do people with swallowing disorders need high viscosity drinks?,"People with swallowing disorders often have difficulty moving food or liquids from their mouth to their stomach.  High viscosity drinks, meaning thicker liquids, are often recommended to help slow down the swallow and make it easier to control the bolus (the mass of food or liquid being swallowed). This can reduce the risk of aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway).  Therefore, people with swallowing disorders often *do* need high viscosity drinks.

Answer: {true}
"
2137,Is Krishna similar to Holy Spirit?,"The Holy Spirit, in Christian theology, is the third person of the Trinity, co-equal with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus Christ).  It's considered the active presence and power of God in the world, often associated with guidance, inspiration, and spiritual gifts.

Krishna, in Hindu theology, is one of the most widely revered and popular deities.  He is considered an avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, one of the principal deities in the Hindu pantheon.  Krishna is associated with numerous attributes, including divine love, wisdom, and playfulness.  He's often depicted in stories demonstrating his divine power and guidance.

While both the Holy Spirit and Krishna are associated with spiritual guidance and divine power, their theological contexts and roles are vastly different. The Holy Spirit exists within a trinitarian framework, while Krishna is part of a much broader and more diverse pantheon within Hinduism.  Their attributes may overlap in certain aspects (e.g., inspiration, divine love), but their overall theological significance and place within their respective religious systems are fundamentally distinct.

2143,Does Hanuman have some of the same duties as Athena?,"Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god, is known for his strength, loyalty, devotion, and intelligence, often acting as a messenger and protector.  He is also revered for his wisdom and ability to overcome obstacles. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts, is similarly associated with strategic thinking, protection, and guidance.  While their roles differ in mythological context, there are some parallels in their functions: both act as advisors and protectors, demonstrate remarkable intelligence and resourcefulness, and exhibit courage and strength in overcoming adversity. However, their specific duties and domains are distinct within their respective pantheons.

2145,Would Temujin hypothetically be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests?,"Temujin, who later became Genghis Khan, was a highly ambitious and successful conqueror who built a vast empire spanning much of Asia.  Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, also built a significant empire across much of Europe. Both were known for their military prowess and territorial expansion.  It's reasonable to assume that a ruler as ambitious as Temujin might well be envious of the scope and scale of Charlemagne's conquests, particularly given the geographical differences between their empires and the different challenges they faced in expansion.  While we can't definitively know Temujin's feelings, it's plausible he would feel some degree of jealousy or at least a sense of competitive admiration.

There is no causal link between the act of immersion baptism and the circumstances of Jeff Buckley's death.

Answer: {false}
"
2148,Are raw carrots better for maximizing vitamin A intake?,"Raw carrots contain beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A.  The body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A as needed. However, cooking carrots can actually *increase* the bioavailability of beta-carotene, meaning your body can absorb and utilize a greater percentage of the vitamin A precursor. While raw carrots are a good source of beta-carotene,  cooked carrots often lead to a higher vitamin A intake.

2150,Would Emmanuel Macron celebrate Cinco de Mayo?,"Emmanuel Macron is the President of France.  Cinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday celebrating the Mexican army's victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. While it's possible Macron might acknowledge the historical significance of the date in a diplomatic context, it's highly unlikely he would celebrate it in the same way Mexicans do, as it's a national holiday for Mexico, not France.  There is no reason to believe that he would personally celebrate it.

"
2152,Is Drew Carey important to the history of wrestling?,"Drew Carey's connection to professional wrestling is primarily through his hosting role for the popular television show ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"".  While not directly involved in the wrestling industry itself, the show's comedic improvisational format often featured wrestling-themed games and jokes, introducing wrestling to a wider audience and potentially influencing its pop-culture image. However, this is a tangential connection and not a major contribution to the history of wrestling itself.  He hasn't been a promoter, wrestler, or significantly influential figure in the business's development.

Answer: {false}
"
2153,Are fossil fuels reducing jobs in the Gulf of Mexico?,"The oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico is a major employer.  The transition to renewable energy sources and increasing focus on reducing carbon emissions is leading to decreased investment and activity in the fossil fuel sector. This reduction in activity directly translates to job losses in areas like drilling, refining, and support services within the Gulf of Mexico region.  Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the shift away from fossil fuels is resulting in job reductions in the Gulf of Mexico.

"
2154,Would Roman Gallic Wars army struggle to build the pyramids faster?,"Explanation: The Roman army during the Gallic Wars was highly organized and efficient, skilled in engineering and logistics.  While they didn't build pyramids, their infrastructure projects (roads, aqueducts, fortifications) demonstrate impressive organizational capabilities and engineering prowess.  The construction of the pyramids, however, required immense manpower and specialized techniques, including the precise quarrying, transportation, and placement of massive stones.  While the Roman army might have been able to contribute some efficiency, the scale and specialized knowledge involved in pyramid building would likely make it difficult for them to complete the task faster than the ancient Egyptians, who developed specialized methods over centuries.

2155,Do workers at Nissan's headquarters eat with chopsticks?,"Nissan is a Japanese company, and chopsticks are commonly used for eating in Japan.  While not everyone in Japan uses chopsticks, it's a reasonable assumption that some, if not many, workers at Nissan headquarters would use chopsticks for at least some meals.  However, there's no guarantee that *all* workers would, and the company's headquarters are internationally distributed. Therefore the question can't be definitively answered true or false without further information.

"
2177,Does Neville Longbottom have more courage as a child than as an adult?,"Neville Longbottom's character arc in the Harry Potter series shows a significant development in courage.  As a child, his courage is often hesitant and stems from a desire to please others or avoid punishment. He is often clumsy and fearful.  However, as he grows older, his courage becomes more pronounced, stemming from a strong sense of justice, loyalty, and self-belief.  His bravery in the face of Voldemort and his willingness to stand up for what is right demonstrate a significant increase in his courage throughout the series.  Therefore, while he displays some courage as a child, his adult courage is far greater and more consistent.

2178,Would a model be appropriate to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake?,"The appropriateness of a model starring in a remake of *La Femme Nikita* depends entirely on the model's acting ability and the director's vision for the role.  While a model might possess the physical attributes often associated with the character (beauty, athleticism), acting skill is crucial for portraying the complex emotional and psychological depth of Nikita.  A successful remake would require an actor who can convey Nikita's strength, vulnerability, and the emotional toll of her past and present circumstances.  If the model is a talented actress, then their inclusion is appropriate. However, if casting focuses solely on appearance without considering acting talent, the remake could suffer.

2184,Would many meals heavy in brussels sprouts benefit someone on Coumadin?,"Explanation:

Coumadin (warfarin) is a blood thinner that works by interfering with vitamin K metabolism.  Brussels sprouts, like many leafy green vegetables, are rich in vitamin K.  Consuming large quantities of vitamin K can counteract the effects of Coumadin, making the blood less thin and potentially increasing the risk of blood clots.  Therefore, someone on Coumadin should maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K to avoid unpredictable changes in their blood's clotting ability.  While some Brussels sprouts might be fine, many meals heavy in them would be a significant and potentially dangerous increase in vitamin K intake.

2185,Is the Holy Land important to Eastern religions?,"The Holy Land, encompassing regions in modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Jordan, holds immense religious significance for several Eastern religions, most notably Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  Judaism considers the region the ancestral homeland and the site of key biblical events. Christianity views it as the birthplace and setting of Jesus's life and ministry. Islam reveres the region because of its connection to the Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) and significant historical events.  While these are Abrahamic religions, and not all Eastern religions are Abrahamic,  the importance of the Holy Land within these major faiths highlights its profound influence on Eastern religious traditions and beliefs.  Therefore, the statement is true.

2186,Does the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom have poor job security?,"The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom can be removed from office through several mechanisms.  They can be ousted by a vote of no confidence from their own party, leading to a leadership contest.  Alternatively, a general election can result in a change of government, automatically removing the incumbent Prime Minister.  Therefore, their job security is relatively poor compared to many other heads of government around the world.  The relatively frequent changes in leadership in recent UK history also support this conclusion.

Answer: {true}
"
2187,Could all People's Volunteer Army hypothetically be transported on Symphony of the Seas?,"The People's Volunteer Army (PVA) was a large military force during the Korean War.  Estimates of its size vary, but it's generally accepted that it numbered in the millions.  The Symphony of the Seas is a large cruise ship, but its passenger capacity is far smaller than the number of soldiers in the PVA.  Even if we assume a conservative estimate of the PVA's size and only considered transporting soldiers (ignoring equipment, supplies, etc.), there simply wouldn't be enough space on the Symphony of the Seas to accommodate them all.

Answer: {false}
"
2188,Can professional boxers expect to have low dental bills?,"Professional boxers are known for taking significant blows to the head and face during their careers.  These blows can cause considerable damage to teeth, leading to broken, chipped, or knocked-out teeth.  This necessitates frequent dental visits and potentially extensive and costly dental procedures, such as root canals, crowns, implants, and orthodontics. Therefore, professional boxers are unlikely to have low dental bills.

Answer: {false}
"
2189,Could the leader of Heaven's Gate save images in JPEG format?,"The Heaven's Gate cult ended in a mass suicide in 1997.  JPEGs were developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and became widely used by the mid-1990s. It's highly likely that the technology and widespread availability of JPEGs existed by 1997.  Therefore, it's plausible that the group could have used JPEGs.

Answer: {true}
"
2190,Has type of political association Pompey had with Caesar influenced reality TV?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:  There's no direct causal link between Pompey's political association with Caesar and the creation or content of reality TV.  Reality TV's development is rooted in various technological and cultural advancements, particularly the rise of television and changing audience preferences, not ancient Roman politics. While Pompey and Caesar's relationship might offer interesting parallels to power dynamics and alliances shown in some reality shows (competition, betrayal, etc.), it's a tenuous and indirect connection at best, insufficient to claim influence.
"
2191,Are the knights in the Medieval Times show not authentic knights?,"The Medieval Times show is a dinner theater production that features staged jousting and other events meant to evoke a medieval atmosphere.  The ""knights"" are actors portraying the roles, not authentic medieval knights.  They are trained performers, not historical figures engaging in genuine combat.

Answer: {true}
"
2192,Did the 23rd amendment give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president?,"The 23rd Amendment to the United States Constitution grants Washington D.C. electoral votes in presidential elections.  It does *not* grant voting rights to Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but they are not residents of a state and thus do not have voting rights in presidential elections.  The amendment only addresses the District of Columbia.

Answer: {false}
"
2194,Would Bruce Gandy be an odd choice for Messiah (Handel)?,"Explanation:
The question asks if Bruce Gandy would be an odd choice for the role of Messiah in Handel's oratorio.  Handel's Messiah is a well-known classical piece, and the role typically requires a highly trained and accomplished classical singer, often a countertenor or tenor, with significant vocal ability and experience in operatic or oratorio performance.  There is no publicly available information suggesting Bruce Gandy is such a singer.  Therefore, choosing someone without this background would be considered unusual.

2196,Could someone in a coma experience fear?,"A person in a coma is generally unresponsive and shows no signs of awareness.  While they may have brain activity, their level of consciousness is significantly impaired.  They are not processing information in a way that allows for the experience of complex emotions like fear.  Fear requires a level of conscious awareness and processing of potential threats, which is absent in a coma.  While some involuntary physiological responses might occur, these would not equate to the subjective emotional experience of fear.

Answer: {false}
"
2197,Does Andrew Johnson's presidential number exceed Elagabalus's Emperor number?,"Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States.  Elagabalus was the Roman Emperor number 22.  Therefore, Andrew Johnson's presidential number (17) is less than Elagabalus's emperor number (22).

Answer: {false}
"
2198,Can Lamborghini's fastest model win a race against a Porsche 911?,"To determine if Lamborghini's fastest model could win a race against a Porsche 911, we need to compare the performance specifications of the fastest models from each manufacturer.  This involves looking at factors like horsepower, torque, 0-60 mph time, and top speed.  While specific models and their performance numbers change over time, generally, both Lamborghini and Porsche produce high-performance sports cars capable of extremely fast speeds.  The outcome of a race would depend on various factors including the specific models competing, the track conditions (including length and type), driver skill, and even weather.  It's not possible to definitively say which would win without specifying the exact car models and race conditions. Therefore, a definitive answer is not possible.

Answer: {false}
"
2199,Are fresh garlic cloves as easy to eat as roasted garlic cloves?,"Raw garlic cloves have a strong, pungent flavor and sharp, sometimes burning, texture that many find unpleasant to eat on their own.  Roasted garlic, on the other hand, undergoes a transformation where the heat mellows its harshness, resulting in a sweeter, softer, and more spreadable texture. This makes roasted garlic much more palatable for direct consumption.  Therefore, fresh garlic cloves are not as easy to eat as roasted garlic cloves.

Answer: {false}
"
2200,Do most college students own a fax machine?,"Explanation:

2201,Could Bernie Sanders visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art twenty times for under two hundred dollars?,"The question asks if Bernie Sanders could visit the Met 20 times for under $200.  We are given that Bernie Sanders is a senior citizen.  The price of admission for senior citizens from outside NY, NJ, or CT is $17.  Twenty visits would cost 20 * $17 = $340.  This is more than $200.

"
2206,Do placozoa get learning disabilities?,"Placozoa are simple multicellular animals with a very basic nervous system.  They lack a brain and complex organs associated with higher cognitive functions like learning.  Learning disabilities, by definition, require a capacity for learning that is then impaired.  Given the extremely rudimentary structure of Placozoa, it's highly improbable they possess the neurological capacity for learning, let alone the potential for learning disabilities.

Answer: {false}
"
2207,Are System of a Down opposed to globalization?,"System of a Down's lyrics and public statements frequently express criticism of globalization's negative impacts, particularly its exploitation of workers and resources, and the resulting social and political inequalities.  While they don't explicitly state blanket opposition to all forms of globalization, their consistent critique of its negative consequences strongly suggests an anti-globalization stance.

Answer: {true}
"
2208,Was Dr. Seuss a liar?,"Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, was a children's author known for his whimsical stories and illustrations.  While his books are fantastical and not meant to be taken literally, there's no evidence to suggest he was a liar in his personal life or that he intentionally fabricated information in a way that would constitute lying in a factual sense.  His books are works of fiction. While some have criticized certain aspects of his earlier works for stereotypical portrayals, this doesn't equate to him being a liar.

Answer: {false}
"
2209,Is it normally unnecessary to wear a coat in Hollywood in July?,"Hollywood, California has a Mediterranean climate.  July falls within the warmest months of the year.  Average high temperatures in July are typically in the low 80s Fahrenheit (around 27-29 Celsius), and lows are in the 60s Fahrenheit (around 15-21 Celsius).  While evenings might be cool enough to warrant a light jacket for some, during the day, a coat would generally be considered unnecessary and even quite warm.

Answer: {true}
"
2210,Will silicon wedding rings outsell bromine wedding rings?,"Silicon is a common, relatively inexpensive material used in various applications, including some jewelry. Bromine, on the other hand, is a highly reactive and corrosive halogen.  It is not a material typically used in jewelry due to its dangerous properties.  It would be highly improbable and unsafe to make wedding rings from bromine.  Therefore, silicon wedding rings would almost certainly outsell bromine wedding rings, not because of inherent desirability but simply because bromine wedding rings are essentially impossible to produce and sell.

Answer: {true}
"
2211,Would Saddam Hussein hypothetically choose Saladin as ally over Idris I?,"Answer: Saddam Hussein was a Ba'athist, and Ba'athism is a secular Arab nationalist ideology.  Saladin was a powerful Sunni Muslim leader who unified much of the Muslim world against the Crusaders, a figure often celebrated in Arab nationalism. Idris I, on the other hand, was the founder of the Idrisid dynasty in Morocco, a much earlier and geographically distant figure with less direct relevance to pan-Arab or Ba'athist ideology. Given Saddam Hussein's ideology and the historical context, it's highly likely he would find Saladin a more relevant and appealing potential ally.

2215,Could a two-year old win a Scrabble tournament?,"Explanation:
A Scrabble tournament requires a player to understand the rules of the game, be able to spell words, and possess a level of strategic thinking.  A two-year-old lacks the cognitive and language skills necessary to participate in or win a Scrabble tournament.  They would be unable to understand the rules, form words, or develop a winning strategy.

"
2216,Would Iris (mythology) and Hermes hypothetically struggle at a UPS job?,"Iris, the messenger goddess in Greek mythology, is known for her speed and ability to travel vast distances instantly.  She wouldn't struggle with the physical demands of a UPS job. Hermes, also a messenger god, is similarly swift and adept at delivering messages.  His trickster nature might make him efficient at navigating complicated delivery routes and dealing with difficult customers, although his mischievous tendencies could also cause problems.  However, neither would be likely to struggle with the core tasks of a UPS job given their mythological abilities.

Answer: {false}
"
2217,Was Dorothea Wendling from same place Porsche originated?,"Dorothea Wendling was a German actress.  Porsche is a German car manufacturer, originating in Stuttgart, Germany.  Therefore, it's likely Dorothea Wendling was from the same country as Porsche originated.  However,  without knowing her precise birthplace, we cannot definitively say she originated from the *exact same place* as Porsche.

"
2218,Would it be difficult for Will Ferrell to win Empire Award for Best Newcomer?,"Will Ferrell is a well-established and highly successful actor with a long and prominent career.  The Empire Awards are given to recognize outstanding achievement in the film industry, and the ""Best Newcomer"" award is specifically designed for actors making their debut or significantly breaking through in the year of the award.  Given Ferrell's extensive career, it's highly unlikely he would be considered a newcomer by any reasonable standard, and therefore, it would be extremely difficult for him to win this award.

Answer: {true}
"
2219,Would Tom Cruise ever insult L. Ron Hubbard?,"Tom Cruise is a prominent member of the Church of Scientology, a religion founded by L. Ron Hubbard.  Scientologists are expected to hold Hubbard in high regard, and any public criticism of Hubbard would be considered deeply disrespectful and potentially damaging to their standing within the Church.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that Tom Cruise would ever publicly insult L. Ron Hubbard.

"
2221,Is the Gujarati script the same category of script as Kanji?,"Gujarati is an abugida, a type of alphabet where consonants have inherent vowels, and vowel signs are added to modify the consonant sounds.  Kanji, on the other hand, is a logographic script, meaning each character represents a morpheme (a meaningful unit of language, often a word or part of a word).  While both are writing systems used in different parts of Asia, their fundamental structure and how they represent language differ significantly.  Therefore, they are not in the same category of script.

Answer: {false}
"
2222,Do any video games about the end of civilization have slot machines?,"Many post-apocalyptic video games incorporate elements of survival, scavenging, and resource management.  Slot machines, representing a form of gambling and leisure, are generally incongruous with the themes of hardship and struggle often found in such games. While some games might feature similar mechanics (like a chance-based loot system), these wouldn't be literal slot machines in the traditional sense.  A direct inclusion of slot machines would likely detract from the intended atmosphere of desperation and survival.

Answer: {false}
"
2223,Do you find glutamic acid in a severed finger?,"Glutamic acid is a non-essential amino acid found in many proteins.

2224,Is blonde hair green eyed Sara Paxton considered a Latino?,"Sara Paxton is an American actress.  While her ethnicity is not explicitly stated as Latino, her appearance doesn't automatically qualify or disqualify her as Latino.  Latino is a broad term encompassing a range of ethnicities and nationalities from Latin America.  Paxton's physical characteristics are not definitive indicators of her ancestry.  More information about her family background would be needed to definitively say whether she is Latino.

2225,Did President William Howard Taft read DC Comics?,"Explanation: William Howard Taft served as President of the United States from 1909 to 1913. DC Comics, as we know it today, did not begin publishing until 1934. Therefore, President Taft could not have read DC Comics.

Answer: {false}
"
2226,Do Muslims have a different idea of Seraphim than Christians?,"The concept of Seraphim is rooted in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the Book of Isaiah.  Both Christians and Muslims acknowledge the existence of angels, including high-ranking ones like Seraphim. However, the specifics of their descriptions and roles differ significantly depending on theological interpretations and the texts used.  

In Christian theology, Seraphim are often depicted as six-winged beings surrounding God's throne, singing praises, and possessing immense holiness and power. This imagery is heavily influenced by Isaiah 6.

In Islamic theology, while the Quran mentions angels with immense power and closeness to God, there's no direct equivalent to the Christian description of Seraphim.  Islamic angelology is more diverse and less focused on specific named ranks of angels.  While certain angels like Jibril (Gabriel) have prominent roles, the detailed descriptions of their appearances and attributes are less formalized than in Christian tradition.

Therefore, while both faiths believe in powerful, celestial beings serving God, their understandings of a specifically named and described group like ""Seraphim"" differ substantially.

"
2227,Would you hire someone with dyscalculia to do surveying work?,"Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to understand numbers and perform mathematical calculations. Surveying work heavily relies on precise measurements, calculations, and spatial reasoning, all of which are significantly impacted by dyscalculia.  While a person with dyscalculia might have other valuable skills, their difficulty with mathematical tasks would likely make them unsuitable for surveying work, especially if accuracy is critical.  They might struggle with tasks like calculating distances, areas, and volumes; interpreting survey data; or using surveying equipment effectively.  Therefore, hiring someone with dyscalculia for surveying would likely present significant challenges and increase the risk of errors.

2230,"If your skin was turning the color of a zombie, could it be because of nickel?","Nickel is a metal that can cause a rare allergic reaction called nickel allergy.  This allergy manifests in various ways, including a skin rash that can appear red, itchy, and inflamed.  While the rash wouldn't necessarily be the exact color of a zombie (which is typically depicted as pale grey or greenish),  a severe nickel allergy reaction could potentially cause skin discoloration that might be perceived as unusually pale or even slightly grayish depending on the individual's skin tone.  Therefore, while not a direct ""zombie-like"" color change, nickel allergy could contribute to a noticeable alteration in skin color.

Answer: {true}
"
2231,Could a single bitcoin ever cover cost of a Volkswagen Jetta?,"The price of a Volkswagen Jetta varies depending on the model year and features.  However, a reasonable estimate for a used Jetta would be in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 USD.

The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and fluctuates significantly.  At times, the price has been far below $10,000, and at other times far above.  Therefore, it is entirely possible that a single Bitcoin could have covered the cost of a Volkswagen Jetta at certain points in Bitcoin's history, while at other times it would have been insufficient.

Answer: {true}
"
2232,Does Fraktur have a sordid history?,"Fraktur, a blackletter typeface, was widely used in German-speaking regions for centuries.  However, its association with Nazi Germany during the Holocaust gives it a deeply problematic history.  The Nazis adopted Fraktur as a supposedly ""Germanic"" script, contrasting it with the more international Latin script, and using it to promote a sense of nationalist and racial purity.  This association, though not inherent to the typeface itself, inextricably links Fraktur with a period of immense violence and antisemitism. While Fraktur predates the Nazis and has a rich history beyond this period, the weight of its association with the regime makes its history undeniably ""sordid.""

2233,Was Martin Luther same sect as Martin Luther King Jr.?,"Martin Luther was a 16th-century German theologian who initiated the Protestant Reformation.  Martin Luther King Jr. was a 20th-century American Baptist minister and civil rights activist.  While both men were Christians, they belonged to different denominations and theological traditions. Martin Luther was a founder of Protestantism, while Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist.  Therefore, they were not of the same sect.

2236,Will someone die without white blood cells?,"White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are crucial components of the immune system.  They are responsible for defending the body against infection and disease.  Without white blood cells, the body would be extremely vulnerable to pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.  The lack of an immune response would lead to overwhelming and potentially fatal infections. Therefore, a person without white blood cells would not survive.

Answer: {true}

2237,Did Rand Paul frequently swim in Lake Michigan during his undergraduate years?,"There is no publicly available information specifying Rand Paul's undergraduate activities, including whether he frequently swam in Lake Michigan.  While his biography might mention his college years, details about his recreational habits are unlikely to be included unless they were somehow relevant to a significant event in his life.  Therefore, we cannot determine whether this statement is true or false based on available information.

2238,Can Simon Cowell vote for the next Supreme Court judge?,"Explanation:
The power to appoint Supreme Court justices resides with the President of the United States.  The Senate then confirms the nomination.  Simon Cowell is a British television personality and music executive; he is not a citizen of the United States and therefore has no right to vote in US elections, including those pertaining to the confirmation of Supreme Court justices.

"
2239,Can Michael Bloomberg fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade?,"Here's an explanation to determine if Michael Bloomberg could fund Micronesia's debt for a decade:

To answer this question, we need information on:

1. **Micronesia's annual debt:**  We need the amount of debt Micronesia incurs annually.  This information is likely available from the Micronesian government's financial reports or international financial institutions like the World Bank or IMF.
2. **Michael Bloomberg's net worth:** We need Michael Bloomberg's current net worth.  Reliable sources like Forbes regularly publish estimates of the net worth of prominent individuals.

If we had these two figures, we could make a calculation.  We would multiply Micronesia's annual debt by 10 (for a decade) and compare that figure to Bloomberg's net worth.  If Bloomberg's net worth is significantly greater than Micronesia's total debt for the decade, the answer would be true.  Otherwise, it would be false.

However, without access to real-time financial data, we cannot definitively answer the question.

Answer: {true}
"
2241,Could a cat ride Panzer VIII Maus tank missile from Barcelona to Madrid?,"Explanation:
The Panzer VIII Maus was a German super-heavy tank.  It was never deployed in combat and only two prototypes were ever built.  Even if one were miraculously operational and transported to Barcelona, it is highly unlikely it could travel the distance to Madrid.  Maus tanks were extremely large, heavy, and mechanically complex, not suited for road travel and certainly not for carrying a cat as a passenger.  The logistical difficulties involved in moving a Maus, along with the almost impossible task of finding a suitable road route, mean the premise is highly improbable.  Finally, the inclusion of a cat doesn't make the already improbable situation any less so.

2242,Are Aldi's foods discounted due to being out of date?,"Aldi's business model focuses on offering low prices through efficient operations and supply chain management.  While they do have a ""best by"" date system, their products are not discounted solely because they're close to expiring.  Aldi's low prices are a result of their overall strategy, not primarily due to selling soon-to-expire items.  While some items might be nearing their expiration,  that's not the primary reason for their lower cost structure.

2245,Is it impossible to tell if someone is having a stroke?,"Stroke symptoms can vary widely, and some individuals may experience only mild or subtle symptoms that are easily missed.  There are also situations where other medical conditions might mimic a stroke.  While some signs are very clear (like sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, slurred speech, or sudden vision loss), the onset can be gradual or subtle in other cases.  Therefore, it's not always possible to definitively tell if someone is having a stroke without medical evaluation.

2249,Should you wrap a gift for a mother of a stillborn in stork wrapping paper?,"The death of a stillborn child is an incredibly painful experience. Stork wrapping paper is typically associated with the birth and celebration of a new baby. Using this type of wrapping paper for a gift in this situation would be insensitive and inappropriate, potentially causing further distress to the grieving mother.  A more compassionate and appropriate choice would be a neutral or comforting design.

2251,Would Immanuel Kant be disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement?,"Immanuel Kant's philosophy emphasized universal moral principles based on reason and duty.  While he didn't directly address modern social movements like Black Lives Matter, we can infer his potential reaction based on his core tenets.  Kant's categorical imperative, which dictates acting only according to principles you could wish to become universal law, suggests a strong commitment to equality and justice.  The Black Lives Matter movement fundamentally advocates for equality and an end to systemic racism, which aligns with a Kantian principle of treating all individuals as ends in themselves, not merely as means to an end.  However, Kant's emphasis on reason and order might lead him to critique certain methods or actions within the movement if he perceived them as contradicting his principles of universal moral law.  His strong emphasis on rationality and avoiding emotional responses might lead to a critical assessment of certain protest tactics, even if he agreed with the movement’s overall goals. Therefore, while he likely would have supported the *goals* of Black Lives Matter, it's uncertain whether he would be entirely *undisgusted* by all *methods* employed.  The question asks about disgust, a strong emotional reaction, which isn't entirely consistent with Kant's emphasis on rational and detached moral reasoning.  While some aspects of the movement might conflict with his ideas about order and rational discourse, his core philosophy strongly supports equality and justice, the core principles of the movement.

2252,Are pancakes a bad snack for cats?,"Pancakes are generally not a good snack for cats.  They lack the essential nutrients a cat needs and are high in sugar and carbohydrates, which can lead to digestive upset, weight gain, and even diabetes in cats.  Additionally, the ingredients in many pancake recipes, such as chocolate chips or xylitol (an artificial sweetener), can be toxic to cats.  Therefore, it's best to avoid giving cats pancakes.

2254,Would a honey badger's dentures be different from a wolverine's?,"Honey badgers and wolverines are both mustelids, but they have different dentition adapted to their respective diets and lifestyles.  While both have sharp teeth for tearing flesh, the specifics of their teeth shapes and sizes would differ.  A honey badger's teeth are designed for crushing bones and eating a more varied diet, including insects and honey, while a wolverine's teeth are better suited for powerful bites and taking down larger prey.  Therefore, their dentures (if they had them) would not be identical.

2256,Have any members of the 2020 British royal family allegedly committed a felony?,"Prince Andrew, a member of the British Royal Family, has been accused of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre.  While he has not been formally charged with a crime, the allegations constitute a felony-level offense.  The accusations, regardless of their ultimate legal outcome, represent a serious allegation of felony-level misconduct.

"
2257,Did Wednesday have something to do with Thor?,"The character Wednesday Addams, from the Addams Family, is known for her morbid fascination with death and the macabre.  Thor, the Norse god of thunder, is associated with powerful storms, lightning, and strength.  There is no inherent or direct connection between Wednesday Addams and Thor in established storylines or mythologies.  While one could argue a very loose, metaphorical connection (perhaps associating Wednesday's dark personality with the stormy nature of Thor's domain), it's not a significant or commonly acknowledged relationship.

Answer: {false}

2258,Is honey associated with queens?,"Honey is produced by honeybees, and honeybees have a queen bee who leads the hive.  The queen bee is crucial to the colony's survival and honey production.  Therefore, honey is strongly associated with queens.

Answer: {true}
"
2259,Could Robert Wadlow hypothetically see Frankenstein's monster's bald spot from above?,"Robert Wadlow was the tallest person ever recorded, reaching a height of 8 feet 11 inches (2.72 meters).  Frankenstein's monster, as depicted in popular culture, is typically portrayed as very tall but not as tall as Robert Wadlow.  While the exact height of Frankenstein's monster varies across different adaptations, it's unlikely he would be taller than Robert Wadlow.  Therefore, if Robert Wadlow were positioned above Frankenstein's monster, he would likely be able to see any bald spot the monster might have.

Answer: {true}
"
2260,Would a kindergarten teacher make a lesson of the New Testament?,"Explanation: Kindergarten teachers typically focus on foundational skills like literacy and numeracy.  While some kindergartens might incorporate stories from various cultures and religions as part of a broader social studies or literature curriculum, a dedicated lesson solely focused on the New Testament would be unusual and likely outside the scope of a standard kindergarten curriculum.  The content of the New Testament is complex and requires a level of comprehension beyond what is typically expected of kindergarteners.

Answer: {false}
"
2261,Did Alfred Nobel write a banned book?,"Alfred Nobel did not write any books that were banned.

His writings were primarily scientific and related to his inventions and business dealings.

2262,Does taking ukemi halt kinetic energy?,"Ukemi, or breakfalls, are techniques used in martial arts to safely absorb and redirect impact.  While ukemi doesn't entirely *halt* kinetic energy (it's impossible to completely eliminate energy), it significantly reduces the force transmitted to the body.  This is achieved by spreading the force over a larger area, increasing the time over which the force is applied (reducing the peak force), and using the body's structure to redirect some of the force.  The kinetic energy is not destroyed, but is instead transformed into other forms of energy (such as heat and sound) and dissipated through the body's movement and the interaction with the ground.

Answer: {false}

"
2264,Will Futurama surpass the number of episodes of The Simpsons by the end of 2020?,"Explanation:
To answer this question, we need to know the number of episodes of Futurama and The Simpsons by the end of 2020.  The Simpsons had significantly more episodes than Futurama throughout its run and continued airing new episodes well past 2020.  Futurama had several cancellations and revivals, but it's unlikely that the total number of episodes would have surpassed The Simpsons by 2020.  We need to look up the episode counts for each show by the end of 2020.  

Answer: {false}

2265,Do more anchovy live in colder temperature waters than warmer?,"Anchovies are a type of fish that thrive in a range of temperatures, but they generally prefer cooler waters.  While some species can tolerate warmer temperatures, many species are found in higher concentrations in cooler waters.  Their distribution is influenced by factors like food availability and predator presence, but temperature is a significant factor. Therefore, more anchovies are likely found in colder waters.

"
2266,Does being good at guitar hero make you a good guitarist?,"Guitar Hero is a video game that simulates playing a guitar.  While it requires hand-eye coordination, rhythm, and timing – skills that can be beneficial to learning a real guitar – it doesn't translate directly to the physical skills and musical understanding needed to be a good guitarist.  Playing Guitar Hero doesn't involve actually using a guitar, developing finger strength, understanding music theory, or learning to improvise.  Proficiency in Guitar Hero might indicate a predisposition towards musical rhythm, but it's not a substitute for actual guitar playing practice.

Answer: {false}
"
2267,Did any killer Manson band members were named for exceed Charles Manson's kills?,"The question asks if any Manson Family members were responsible for more killings than Charles Manson himself.  While Charles Manson was the mastermind and instigator behind the Tate-LaBianca murders, he did not directly commit the killings himself.  Several members of the Manson Family were convicted for their roles in those murders.  However, determining whether any individual member exceeded Manson's ""kill count"" is difficult and depends on how one defines responsibility.  Manson was convicted and sentenced to death (later commuted to life imprisonment) as the instigator, and his culpability extends to the actions of his followers.  While some Family members may have personally killed more people than others, Manson remains centrally implicated in all the crimes.  Therefore, while some individuals participated in more killings, attributing a higher ""kill count"" to them solely without acknowledging Manson's pivotal role as the instigator is inaccurate.

2268,Can the US branch of government that has power over the military also have the power to veto?,"The US branch of government with power over the military is the Executive branch, specifically the President as Commander-in-Chief.  The power to veto legislation rests with the President as well. Therefore, the same branch of government that commands the military also possesses the power of veto.

Answer: {true}
"
2269,Do Christians anticipate an existence in Sheol after death?,"Christian beliefs about the afterlife vary among denominations, but generally speaking, Sheol is not understood as the final destination for believers.  Sheol, as depicted in the Old Testament, is often seen as a general term for the grave or the underworld, a place of the dead.  In Christian theology, Jesus's resurrection and the promise of eternal life transformed the understanding of death and the afterlife.  While some aspects of Sheol might be interpreted allegorically in relation to the Old Testament, Christians generally believe that believers go to Heaven or Paradise after death, while unbelievers face judgment and a different fate.  Therefore, the anticipation of Sheol as a final resting place is not a central tenet of Christian belief.

Answer: {false}
"
2270,Were the Great Pyramids built by a theocratic government?,"The Great Pyramids of Giza were built during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, a period characterized by a strong centralized government ruled by pharaohs.  Pharaohs were considered divine rulers, embodying the power of the gods and possessing absolute authority. Their power extended to all aspects of Egyptian life, including the monumental construction projects like the pyramids.  The construction of the pyramids required immense resources and manpower, clearly demonstrating the power and control exerted by the theocratic government.  The pyramids themselves served as tombs for the pharaohs and were integral to their religious beliefs and practices.  Therefore, the pyramids were built under a system where religious and political power were intertwined.

Answer: {true}
"
2271,Can Justin Timberlake ride Shipwreck Falls at Six Flags?,"To determine if Justin Timberlake can ride Shipwreck Falls at Six Flags, we need to consider the height restriction.  Shipwreck Falls, like many water rides, has a minimum height requirement for safety reasons. While we don't know Justin Timberlake's exact height, publicly available information doesn't suggest he would be too short to meet this requirement.  Therefore, assuming he meets the height requirement (which is publicly available for each Six Flags location), he could ride the attraction.  However, this is contingent upon the height restriction and whether he chooses to ride it.

Answer: {true}
"
2272,Will Oasis cruise boat traverse the Lincoln Tunnel?,"Oasis cruise boats are massive, ocean-going vessels.  The Lincoln Tunnel is an underwater vehicular tunnel connecting New Jersey and New York.  A cruise ship of that size could not possibly navigate the confines of the Lincoln Tunnel.

"
2273,Does Snoop Dogg advocate a straight edge lifestyle?,"Snoop Dogg is a well-known rapper and cannabis advocate.  A straight edge lifestyle is characterized by abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, recreational drugs, and often caffeine.  Given Snoop Dogg's public persona and well-documented cannabis use, it's highly unlikely he advocates a straight edge lifestyle.

Answer: {false}
"
2274,Can amoebas get cancer?,"Amoebas are single-celled organisms. Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division, typically in multicellular organisms.  While amoebas can experience uncontrolled growth and division under certain circumstances, this isn't considered cancer in the same way as in complex organisms.  The mechanisms and characteristics of cancer, such as metastasis and the formation of tumors, don't apply to single-celled organisms like amoebas.  Therefore, it is not accurate to say amoebas ""get cancer"".  They can exhibit uncontrolled growth, but this is a different phenomenon.

Answer: {false}
"
2275,Did U.S. soldiers listen to Justin Bieber's Believe album during the Battle of Baghdad?,"The Battle of Baghdad took place in 2003. Justin Bieber's album ""Believe"" was released in 2012.

2278,Should you ask a neighbor for candy on New Year's Eve?,"The question asks about a social custom.  There's no established tradition of asking neighbors for candy on New Year's Eve, unlike Halloween.  Trick-or-treating is specifically associated with Halloween.  While some people might give candy to children on New Year's Eve, it's not a widespread or expected practice.

Answer: {false}
"
2279,Would it be unusual to find a yellow perch in the Red Sea?,"Yellow perch are freshwater fish inhabiting lakes and rivers of North America and Europe.  The Red Sea is a saltwater sea located between Africa and Asia.  Freshwater and saltwater fish have different physiological adaptations and cannot survive in each other's environments for extended periods. Therefore, it would be highly unusual to find a yellow perch in the Red Sea.

Answer: {true}
"
2280,Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?,"The Kingdom of Hungary had a complex political system that evolved over time.  While there were periods where the influence of the nobility and landowning classes was significant in electing or influencing the selection of rulers, it wasn't a system of direct election by all landowners in the way a modern democracy might function.  The process often involved a combination of factors including hereditary succession, election by a limited group of nobles (e.g., the Diet), and sometimes even foreign intervention.  Therefore, a simple yes or no answer is misleading.  The statement that ""land owners elected their rulers"" is an oversimplification.

Answer: {false}
"
2281,Would Topa Inca Yupanqui have encountered the western honey bee?,"Topa Inca Yupanqui was the Sapa Inca (emperor) of the Inca Empire from 1471 to 1493.  The western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is not native to the Americas.  It was introduced to the Americas by European colonists after the voyages of Columbus.  Therefore, Topa Inca Yupanqui would not have encountered the western honey bee during his lifetime.

Answer: {false}
"
2282,Did Alice's Adventures in Wonderland inspire Macbeth?,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published in 1865. Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1603 and 1607.  Therefore, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland could not have inspired Macbeth.

Answer: {false}
"
2283,Is a fairy more prevalent in world myths than a valkyrie?,"Fairies are a common element across numerous cultures' mythologies worldwide, appearing in folklore from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, among other regions.  Valkyries, on the other hand, are specifically associated with Norse mythology.  While Valkyries are prominent within Norse mythology, their presence is far less widespread than that of fairies in global mythology.

Answer: {true}
"
2284,Is a Chinchilla breed of felis catus a type of rodent?,"Felis catus is the scientific name for the domestic cat, a member of the Felidae family (cats).  Chinchillas are rodents belonging to the Chinchillidae family.  Therefore, a ""Chinchilla breed of felis catus"" is a contradiction; it's not possible.  A chinchilla cannot be a type of cat.

Answer: {false}

"
2286,Does the Boy Who Cried Wolf hypothetically have reason to pray to Pan?,"The fable ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" depicts a shepherd boy who repeatedly cries wolf as a prank, ultimately leading to no one believing him when a real wolf actually attacks his flock.  Pan is a Greek god associated with nature, wild places, shepherds, and flocks. Given the boy's actions directly impact his flock of sheep and his relationship with nature (which Pan represents), there's a logical argument to be made that he might pray to Pan for forgiveness, protection, or to restore his flock after his deceitful actions.

Answer: {true}
"
2287,Could the Great Wall of China connect the Dodgers to the White Sox?,"The question is asking if the Great Wall of China could connect the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox.  This is a metaphorical question, not a literal one. The Great Wall of China is a physical structure in China, while the Dodgers and White Sox are baseball teams located in the United States.  There's no physical connection between them via the Great Wall.  However, the question could be interpreted metaphorically:  could a connection be *made* between them, perhaps through a shared player, a business deal, or some other indirect link? The vast distances and lack of a direct relationship makes a connection highly improbable, but there's a theoretical possibility some coincidental link could exist.  In a literal sense, the answer is no, but a highly strained metaphorical interpretation could be argued.  Given the phrasing, a literal interpretation is expected.


Answer: {false}
"
2288,Is it unusual to play Happy hardcore music at a funeral?,"Happy hardcore is a fast-paced, energetic genre of electronic dance music often associated with excitement and celebration.  Funerals, on the other hand, are typically somber occasions marked by mourning and reflection.  The stark contrast between the upbeat nature of happy hardcore and the solemn atmosphere of a funeral makes it highly unusual and inappropriate to play this type of music at such an event.

Answer: {true}
"
2289,Could Sainsbury's buy Tesco?,"To determine if Sainsbury's could buy Tesco, we need to compare their market capitalizations (market value).  Sainsbury's market capitalization is significantly smaller than Tesco's.  A successful acquisition would require Sainsbury's to raise a substantial amount of capital, likely through debt financing or a substantial rights issue. While not impossible, the scale of the undertaking and the potential risks make such a large acquisition highly improbable.  Furthermore, regulatory hurdles regarding monopolies would likely prevent such a merger.
