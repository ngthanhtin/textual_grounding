4,Are all limbs required for jujutsu?,"Jujutsu is a martial art that utilizes grappling, throws, joint locks, and pins to subdue an opponent. While many techniques benefit from the use of all limbs, it's not strictly *required*.  A practitioner could, for example, effectively employ jujutsu techniques using primarily their legs if their arms were injured or otherwise unavailable.  The focus is on leverage and control, not necessarily the number of limbs used.

Answer: {false}
"
5,Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?,"Llamas have a gestation period of approximately 11 months.  The Vietnam War lasted from 1955 to 1975.  Even if a llama could give birth immediately after giving birth, it would be impossible for a llama to give birth twice within the 11-month gestation period.  Therefore, it would be impossible for a llama to give birth twice during the Vietnam War.

8,Could a silverfish reach the top of the Empire State Building?,"Explanation:
Silverfish are small insects, typically reaching lengths of around 12-25 mm.  The Empire State Building is approximately 1,250 feet or 381 meters tall.  While silverfish are capable of climbing, they lack the physical ability to climb such a significant height, particularly against the smooth surfaces of a modern skyscraper. They would likely tire, dehydrate, or be affected by environmental conditions long before reaching the top.

9,Are the majority of Reddit users familiar with the Pledge of Allegiance?,"Reddit is a large and diverse online community with users from all over the world and a wide range of ages and backgrounds. While many Reddit users are likely American and familiar with the Pledge of Allegiance, it's improbable that *the majority* are.  The Pledge is a specifically American tradition, and Reddit's user base is significantly international.  Many subreddits focus on niche interests where knowledge of the Pledge would be irrelevant.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that a majority of Reddit users are familiar with it.

"
11,Can Reiki be stored in a bottle?,"Reiki is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine practice that involves purportedly channeling energy through the practitioner's hands to promote healing.  It's based on the belief in a universal life force energy.  There is no scientific evidence that Reiki energy exists, let alone that it can be stored in a bottle. The concept of storing Reiki in a bottle contradicts the fundamental principles of Reiki, which emphasize the flow of energy through the practitioner's hands and intentional channeling. Therefore, it's not possible to store Reiki in a bottle.

Answer: {false}
"
12,"While viewing ""Scary Movie"" is the viewer likely to experience an increase in adrenaline?","Scary movies are designed to elicit fear and suspense, and fear triggers the body's fight-or-flight response.  This response involves the release of adrenaline, a hormone that increases heart rate, blood pressure, and alertness, preparing the body for action. Therefore, watching a scary movie like ""Scary Movie"" is likely to cause an increase in adrenaline levels.

Answer: {true}
"
13,Would Marvel's Gateway be envious of the Doctor (Doctor Who)'s TARDIS machine?,"Marvel's Gateway is a teleportation device that allows travel between dimensions.  The Doctor's TARDIS is a time machine capable of travelling through time and space. While both facilitate travel between different locations, the TARDIS's capabilities are far more extensive, encompassing time travel and a vastly larger range of destinations.  A being with the ambition and potential to travel across dimensions might well envy the superior technology and flexibility of a machine that can travel through time as well.  Therefore, it's plausible that Gateway would be envious of the TARDIS.

Answer: {true}
"
14,Is material from an aloe plant sometimes enclosed in petroleum-derived products?,"Aloe vera is a common ingredient in many cosmetic and personal care products.  Some of these products also contain petroleum-derived ingredients. While it's not inherently common for aloe to be *enclosed* within petroleum-derived components in a way that it's completely surrounded or encapsulated,  it's frequently used as an ingredient *alongside* them in a single formulated product.  Therefore, it's possible to find aloe vera gel in a product that also contains petroleum-based ingredients like mineral oil or petrolatum. These ingredients are often used for their moisturizing or thickening properties.  So, while not strictly ""enclosed,"" they frequently co-exist within the same product.

Answer: {true}
"
15,Could a bee hummingbird balance a scale with a single pea on it?,"Explanation:
The bee hummingbird is the world's smallest bird, weighing only about 1.7 grams.  A single pea can weigh anywhere from 0.25 to 0.5 grams, depending on the size and type of pea.  Therefore, a single pea likely weighs more than a bee hummingbird.  A bee hummingbird would not be able to balance a scale with a single pea on it.

Answer: {false}
"
16,Would a broadcast from Spirit make the news in 2020?,"Explanation:

Answer: {true}
"
17,Would characters in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone be persecuted as pagans?,"The characters in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone practice magic, which is a form of witchcraft.  Throughout history, those practicing witchcraft or pagan religions have been persecuted.  While the Harry Potter world isn't directly analogous to our own historical context of pagan persecution, the inherent magical practices of the characters would likely lead to persecution if they were placed in a world with historical anti-pagan sentiment.  Therefore, the answer is true.

Answer: {true}
"
18,Can music be used as a weapon?,"Music, while often associated with peace and harmony, can also be used in ways that could be considered weaponized.  This isn't about physical harm in the way a gun is a weapon, but rather using sound to exert psychological or social control.  Examples include:

* **Sonic weapons:**  Technology exists to create high-intensity sound waves that can cause pain, disorientation, and even physical damage. These are used by militaries and law enforcement in some contexts.
* **Propaganda songs:**  Music can be used to promote specific ideologies or incite violence and hatred against particular groups.  Think of national anthems used to rally troops or songs used by extremist groups to promote their agendas.
* **Noise pollution:**  While not explicitly weaponized, excessive noise can be used to harass or control individuals or groups, causing stress and impacting mental wellbeing.

Therefore, while not a weapon in the traditional sense, music can be employed in ways that are inherently damaging and manipulative, making it effective in a range of contexts aimed at controlling or harming people.

Answer: {true}

"
20,Karachi was a part of Alexander the Great's success?,"Alexander the Great's empire extended far into what is now Pakistan, but there's no historical evidence that he founded or even directly controlled the city of Karachi.  While he may have passed through regions near Karachi during his conquests, it wasn't a significant part of his known empire or campaigns. The city's history predates Alexander but has its roots in a different period of history.

"
22,Will The Exorcist stimulate limbic system?,"The film ""The Exorcist"" is a horror film designed to evoke strong emotional responses from the viewer.  The limbic system is the part of the brain responsible for processing emotions, memory, and motivation.  Horror films often aim to trigger the limbic system by inducing fear, anxiety, disgust, and surprise.  The intense and disturbing imagery, sound design, and narrative structure of ""The Exorcist"" are likely to stimulate a strong reaction in the limbic system.

Answer: {true}
"
23,Would World War II have been the same without Alan Turing?,"Alan Turing made significant contributions to codebreaking during World War II, particularly with his work at Bletchley Park on the Enigma machine.  His contributions are widely credited with shortening the war and potentially saving millions of lives.  While it's impossible to definitively say what would have happened without him, it's highly plausible that the war would have been longer, more costly in terms of lives and resources, and potentially resulted in a different outcome.  The Allied victory is strongly linked to the intelligence gleaned from breaking the Enigma code.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that World War II would have been the same without his crucial contributions.

Answer: {false}
"
24,Would a sophist use an épée?,"Answer: {False}

Explanation:

Sophists were ancient Greek teachers of rhetoric and philosophy, known for their skill in argumentation and debate.  There's no historical connection between sophists and the use of épées.  Épées are a type of fencing weapon, and the practice of fencing as a sport developed much later than the era of the sophists.  There's no evidence or reason to believe sophists would have used épées.
"
25,Did Dale Jr hug his dad after their last Daytona 500 together?,"Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s last Daytona 500 was in 2018.  His father, Dale Earnhardt Sr., died in a crash during the Daytona 500 in 2001.  Therefore, a hug between them after Dale Jr.'s last race was impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
26,Can citrus grow in Ulaanbaatar?,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, has a very cold, dry climate with extremely harsh winters. Citrus fruits require warm temperatures and a long growing season, conditions that are not met in Ulaanbaatar.  The city experiences prolonged periods of freezing temperatures, making it impossible for citrus trees to survive and thrive.  Therefore, citrus fruits cannot grow in Ulaanbaatar.

Answer: {false}
"
27,Does New York Harbor sit on a craton without volcanic activity?,"New York Harbor is located on the North American craton.  Cratons are ancient, stable parts of continental crust.  While volcanic activity has occurred in the geologic past across North America, the North American craton itself is characterized by a lack of recent or ongoing volcanic activity.  Therefore, New York Harbor, situated on this craton, would not be expected to experience volcanic activity.

Answer: {true}
"
28,Can the Palace of Westminster tell time in the dark?,"The Palace of Westminster houses the Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as Big Ben), which contains a large clock.  Clocks, by their nature, are designed to tell time, and this is true whether or not it is dark outside. The presence of darkness would not affect the clock's ability to function.

Answer: {true}
"
29,"In teenagers and young adults with depression, are SSRI medications less safe than they are for adults?","The safety and efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) can vary depending on age and other individual factors. While SSRIs are generally considered safe and effective for treating depression in adults, their use in teenagers and young adults is associated with a slightly increased risk of certain side effects, particularly suicidal ideation.  However,  this increased risk is not necessarily a definitive indicator of ""less safe,"" as the benefits of treating depression with medication often outweigh the risks for many individuals.  The decision to prescribe SSRIs to teenagers and young adults is made on a case-by-case basis, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks, and requires close monitoring by a healthcare professional.  The FDA requires a ""black box"" warning on SSRI packaging for this reason.  Therefore, while the risk profile may differ slightly, ""less safe"" is a simplification.

Answer: {false}
"
31,Would Persephone be a good consultant to a landscape architect?,"Persephone, in Greek mythology, is the queen of the Underworld and associated with spring and the growth of vegetation.  While she doesn't have formal expertise in landscape architecture, her dominion over the natural world, specifically plants and the cycle of growth and death, could make her insights valuable. A landscape architect might find her perspective on the cyclical nature of plant life, the relationship between the underworld (roots and hidden aspects) and the visible world (growth and blossoms) insightful for creating harmonious and evocative designs.  However, her connection to the underworld and its often unpredictable nature might make her input less reliable than a trained professional.  Therefore, her value as a consultant is debatable.

Answer: {false}
"

34,Would it be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages?,"High schoolers today rarely use traditional phone books like the Yellow Pages.  The information found in the Yellow Pages—business listings, phone numbers, addresses—is readily available online through search engines like Google, online maps, and business websites.  This easy access to information through digital means makes the Yellow Pages largely obsolete for the current generation.

Answer: {true}
"
35,Could an escapee swim nonstop from Alcatraz island to Siberia?,"Alcatraz Island is located in San Francisco Bay, off the coast of California, USA.  Siberia is a vast region in northern Asia.  The distance between Alcatraz and Siberia is thousands of miles, crossing the entire Pacific Ocean.  Even an extremely strong swimmer could not swim that distance nonstop.  The journey would be impossible due to the vast distance, the dangers of open ocean currents, extreme weather conditions, exhaustion, and the lack of food and water.

Answer: {false}
"
36,Would the Titanic be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland?,"The Titanic sank in the Atlantic Ocean, not the Gulf of Finland.  The conditions at the bottom of the Atlantic, including the pressure, cold temperatures, and lack of light, have contributed to the deterioration of the wreck, not its preservation.  The Gulf of Finland would also not offer significantly different conditions that would promote the preservation of a sunken ship.

Answer: {false}
"
37,Could a snowy owl survive in the Sonoran?,"Snowy owls are adapted to extremely cold climates and require habitats with abundant snow cover for hunting and camouflage.  The Sonoran Desert is characterized by extreme heat, arid conditions, and a complete lack of snow.  The lack of prey adapted to the desert environment would also make survival extremely difficult for a snowy owl. Therefore, a snowy owl would not be able to survive in the Sonoran Desert.

Answer: {false}
"
38,Would a rabbi worship martyrs Ranavalona I killed?,"Ranavalona I was the queen of Madagascar who persecuted Christians.  A rabbi would not worship martyrs killed by Ranavalona I, as the rabbi would follow Judaism, and the martyrs would have likely been Christians.  The religions are distinct and incompatible in their worship practices.

Answer: {false}
"
39,Would an oil painter avoid reds from scale insects that live on a cactus?,"An oil painter would likely avoid using pigments derived from scale insects living on cacti because those insects produce carminic acid, which creates a crimson or scarlet color (cochineal). While beautiful, cochineal is an animal-derived pigment, and many modern artists choose to avoid animal-derived products for ethical or environmental reasons.  Additionally, sourcing and preparing cochineal can be complex. Therefore, an oil painter might choose more readily available and ethically sourced synthetic pigments instead of cochineal.

Answer: {true}
"
40,Was the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution written without consideration for black Americans?,"The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1791.  At that time, Black Americans were enslaved in many states and were not considered citizens with the same rights as white Americans.  The very concept of individual liberty and the right to bear arms, as enshrined in the Second Amendment, was not extended to them.  Therefore, it can be argued that the amendment was written without explicit consideration for Black Americans, as their legal status and rights were not acknowledged in the context of the amendment's drafting and ratification.  While the amendment's text doesn't explicitly exclude Black people, the historical context of slavery and the lack of their citizenship rights strongly suggests that their interests were not considered.

Answer: {true}
"
41,Are all the elements plants need for photosynthesis present in atmosphere of Mars?,"Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, water, and light.  While Mars has carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, it is extremely thin and lacks sufficient water vapor or liquid water in accessible forms.  Additionally, while Mars receives sunlight, the atmospheric conditions make the process of photosynthesis highly improbable if not impossible. Therefore, not all the necessary elements are present.

Answer: {false}
"
42,Can you find Bob Marley's face in most smoke shops?,"Bob Marley's image is frequently used in marketing and branding related to cannabis culture.  Many smoke shops cater to this market and therefore might display his image on products, posters, or other promotional materials.  While not guaranteed in every smoke shop, it is highly probable to find his likeness in many of them.

Answer: {true}
"
43,Did Pablo Escobar's nickname collection outshine Robert Moses Grove's?,"Pablo Escobar had numerous nicknames, reflecting his notoriety and power.  Robert Moses, while influential, didn't have a collection of widespread nicknames in the same way.  Therefore, Pablo Escobar's collection of nicknames likely outshone Robert Moses'.

Answer: {true}
"
44,Has the Subway restaurant franchise had any connections with child abusers?,"Subway's spokesperson, Jared Fogle, was convicted of child exploitation offenses.  This significantly damaged the Subway brand's reputation and involved the company in a major scandal related to child abuse.

Answer: {true}
"
45,Does autopilot rely on fossil fuels?,"Autopilot systems, as used in aircraft and increasingly in automobiles, rely on electricity for their operation.  The electricity itself may come from various sources, including fossil fuel-powered generators (in the case of aircraft or some ground vehicles). However, the autopilot itself doesn't directly consume or utilize fossil fuels. It's the power *source* that might be dependent on fossil fuels, not the autopilot system itself.

Answer: {false}
"
46,Are psychiatric patients welcome to join the United States Air Force?,"The United States Air Force, like all branches of the US military, has strict medical and psychological standards for enlistment.  Individuals with a history of serious mental illness, including those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders requiring ongoing treatment, are generally disqualified from service.  While specific conditions and their severity are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a history of significant psychiatric issues would likely prevent someone from meeting the Air Force's fitness standards.  Therefore, psychiatric patients are not generally welcome to join the United States Air Force.

Answer: {false}
"
47,Does Nicole Kidman know any Scientologists?,"Nicole Kidman was married to Tom Cruise, a prominent Scientologist, for many years.  During their marriage, she would have inevitably interacted with and likely known numerous other Scientologists within the Church of Scientology's network.  Even after their divorce, her association with the religion through her former spouse would likely mean she still has some level of acquaintance with Scientologists.

Answer: {true}
"
48,Was John Lennon known to be a good friend to Sasha Obama?,"John Lennon died in 1980. Sasha Obama was born in 2001.  Therefore, it would be impossible for them to have been friends.

"
49,Would the tunnels at CERN fit onto the High Speed 1 rails?,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a 27-kilometer ring.  High Speed 1 (HS1) is a high-speed railway line in the UK.  The tunnels of the LHC are far larger and more complex than the tunnels used for HS1.  The LHC's tunnels are designed for a specific purpose, housing specialized equipment, and are not designed for trains. The diameter of the LHC tunnel is significantly larger than that of an HS1 tunnel.  There's no way the LHC tunnels could fit onto the HS1 rails, even if they were somehow disassembled and reassembled.

Answer: {false}
"
50,Could an elephant easily defeat a male macaque?,"An elephant is significantly larger and stronger than a male macaque.  Elephants possess immense physical strength, tusks, and a powerful trunk, all of which would easily overpower a macaque.

51,Do the Ubuntu people speak Ubuntu?,"The Ubuntu people are a diverse group of people in southern Africa.  They do not have a single language called ""Ubuntu.""  Instead, they speak various Bantu languages, such as Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and others, depending on the specific region and community.  ""Ubuntu"" is a Nguni Bantu term that describes a philosophy and set of values, not a language.

Answer: {false}
"
52,Is cycling a high-risk activity for pelvis fractures?,"Cycling, while generally a low-impact activity, can still contribute to pelvis fractures, particularly in the case of accidents.  A fall from a bicycle, especially at higher speeds or involving impact with a hard surface, can easily result in a pelvic fracture.  While not a statistically high-risk activity compared to others (like contact sports), the potential for serious injury, including pelvic fractures, is certainly present.

Answer: {true}
"
53,Is a platypus immune from cholera?,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that platypuses are immune to cholera.  Cholera is caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, and while some animals may have some level of natural resistance due to their immune systems, there's no indication that platypuses are uniquely immune.  Further research would be needed to determine any specific susceptibility or resistance.

Answer: {false}
"
54,Would a moose hypothetically be too much for a minotaur to devour whole?,"A moose is a large, powerful animal.  Adult moose can weigh over 1,000 pounds.  While a Minotaur is depicted as a powerful mythical creature, it's not depicted as possessing superhuman strength to the degree that it could consume an entire moose.  Therefore, it is unlikely a Minotaur could devour a whole moose.

Answer: {false}
"
55,Are there bones in an anchovy pizza?,"Anchovies are small fish.  Fish have bones.  Therefore, unless the anchovies in a pizza are completely boneless, there will be bones present.  While some anchovy processing removes bones, it is not always complete.

Answer: {true}
"
56,Can a Bengal cat survive eating only pancakes?,"Pancakes lack the necessary nutrients for a Bengal cat's survival.  Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies require specific nutrients found primarily in animal-based foods.  Pancakes, being primarily carbohydrates, lack the essential amino acids, taurine, and other vital components that cats need for healthy organs, vision, and overall well-being.  A diet consisting solely of pancakes would lead to severe malnutrition, disease, and eventually death for a Bengal cat.

Answer: {false}
"
57,Can the original name of the zucchini be typed on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard?,"The original name of the zucchini is ""courgette"".  The top row of a QWERTY keyboard contains the letters QWERTYUIOP.  The word ""courgette"" contains the letters 'c', 'o', 'u', 'r', 'g', 'e', and 't'.  The letters 'c', 'o', 'u', 'r', 'e', and 't' are all present on the top row, however 'g' is not. Therefore, the original name of the zucchini cannot be typed on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard.

Answer: {false}
"

"
59,Do people in middle school usually get breast exams?,"Explanation: Breast exams are not a routine part of preventative healthcare for middle school-aged children.  While some girls may begin puberty earlier than others and experience breast development, regular breast exams are typically recommended for women starting in their twenties.  Middle school health screenings generally focus on other aspects of health and well-being.  A doctor might examine breasts if a specific concern arises, but this would not be a standard procedure.

"
61,Would  bald eagle deliver an urgent message before B-52?,"Explanation:
A bald eagle is a bird and cannot deliver a message. A B-52 is a large, long-range strategic bomber aircraft capable of delivering messages (in the form of bombs or other payloads).  Therefore, a B-52 would be capable of delivering a message far faster and more effectively than a bald eagle.

Answer: {false}
"
62,Does Snoopy look like Chance from Homeward Bound?,"Snoopy, the beagle from the Peanuts comic strip, and Chance, the golden retriever from the movie Homeward Bound, are both dogs, but they have very different appearances. Snoopy is a cartoon beagle with distinctive floppy ears, a black nose, and a generally more slender build.  Chance, on the other hand, is a realistic depiction of a golden retriever, a breed with a different body type and fur color.  While both are dogs, their visual similarities are minimal.

Answer: {false}
"
63,Was Dioskourides a lapidary?,"Dioscorides was a Greek physician, botanist, and pharmacologist who lived in the 1st century CE.  He is best known for his work *De Materia Medica*, a comprehensive encyclopedia of medicinal plants and minerals. While his work describes many minerals and their uses, there's no evidence to suggest he was a lapidary (someone who cuts, polishes, and engraves gems). His expertise lay in the medicinal properties of substances, not their artistic or decorative treatment.

Answer: {false}
"
64,Do most middle class families have butlers?,"The vast majority of middle-class families do not employ butlers.  Butlers are a luxury service typically associated with wealthier households who can afford the expense of hiring and maintaining such a position.

Answer: {false}
"
67,Did Solomon make up bigger percentage of Islamic prophets than Kings of Judah?,"Explanation:

To answer this question, we need to consider the number of Islamic prophets and the number of Kings of Judah.  The Quran names many prophets, including figures also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus).  However, the Quran doesn't offer a definitive, exhaustive list of all prophets, stating that there were many more than those explicitly named.

The Kings of Judah are a more precisely defined group, with a relatively short list documented in the Hebrew Bible.  While the exact number might vary depending on interpretation of biblical accounts, it's a significantly smaller group than the implied number of prophets in the Quran.  Even if Solomon is counted as one of the significant prophets in Islam,  the proportion of Islamic prophets who are also Kings of Judah would still likely be a small percentage due to the much larger number of prophets mentioned or implied in Islamic texts.


Answer: {false}
"
68,Would Taylor Swift refer to Snoopy as oppa?,"Explanation:
""Oppa"" is a Korean term of endearment used by younger women to address older men.  Taylor Swift is American, and while she may use terms of endearment,  there's no reason to believe she would use a Korean term like ""oppa"" to refer to Snoopy, a cartoon beagle.  Snoopy is not Korean, and the cultural context is inappropriate.

Answer: {false}
"
69,Did Confederate States Army influence West Point fashion?,"The Confederate States Army and West Point are distinct entities with separate histories and traditions.  While there might be some overlap in military fashion elements generally, it's unlikely the Confederate States Army had a direct and significant influence on the specific fashion of West Point's uniforms or customs. West Point's traditions and uniform styles have evolved over a long period, drawing from various influences, but primarily from the broader history of the U.S. Army.  The Confederate army was a separate, opposing force during the American Civil War, and its style wouldn't likely be a source of emulation for West Point.

Answer: {false}

71,Do all parts of the aloe vera plant taste good?,"Aloe vera has a variety of components, and the taste varies greatly depending on the part of the plant.  The gel inside the leaves is generally described as having a mild, slightly bitter taste.  However, other parts of the plant, such as the skin or the outer layer, are much more bitter and unpleasant to taste. Therefore, not all parts of the aloe vera plant taste good.

73,Did Kurt Cobain's music genre survive after his death?,"Kurt Cobain's music, which is categorized as grunge, significantly influenced the alternative rock scene that continued to thrive after his death in 1994. While grunge as a dominant mainstream genre eventually faded, its impact on music is undeniable, and many bands continued to incorporate elements of grunge into their music.  Therefore, while grunge might not be as commercially prominent as it was during its peak, the genre and its influence survived.

75,Would eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market be profitable for a steel company?,"Eliminating competition in the Japanese bulk carrier market would likely be very profitable for a steel company for several reasons:

* **Reduced Transportation Costs:**  Steel companies rely heavily on bulk carriers to transport raw materials (like iron ore and coal) and finished products.  By controlling the bulk carrier market, a steel company could negotiate significantly lower shipping rates, directly impacting their production costs.  This could give them a massive competitive advantage over companies still reliant on market-rate shipping.

* **Guaranteed Capacity:**  Having control over shipping eliminates the risk of shortages in transportation capacity. This is crucial for maintaining consistent production and meeting deadlines, especially during peak demand periods.  It provides a certain level of supply chain security.

* **Increased Bargaining Power:** A monopoly or near-monopoly on bulk carrier shipping gives the steel company leverage in negotiations with other suppliers and buyers. They could dictate terms more effectively, impacting profit margins favorably.

* **Potential for Increased Revenue Streams:** The steel company could even extend the bulk carrier service to other companies (though this may be seen as anti-competitive), creating another profitable revenue stream unrelated to steel production itself.

However, eliminating competition through monopolistic practices is illegal in most countries, including Japan, and would likely result in severe penalties including hefty fines and potential prison sentences.

76,Would a geographer use biochemistry in their work?,"Geography is the study of the Earth's physical features, the atmosphere, and human activity in relation to these features.  Biochemistry, on the other hand, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. While some aspects of geography might touch upon biological elements (e.g., studying the impact of deforestation on ecosystems),  biochemistry is not a core or typical tool used by geographers.  Geographers might use data informed by biochemistry, but they don't typically conduct biochemical experiments or analysis themselves.

Answer: {false}
"
77,Is most coffee produced South of the Equator?,"Coffee is grown in a band around the equator, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  While some significant coffee-producing countries are south of the equator (e.g., Brazil, Colombia),  many are also north of the equator (e.g., Mexico, Indonesia, Vietnam).  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say *most* coffee is produced south of the equator.  It's more accurate to say that coffee is produced in a region straddling the equator.

Answer: {false}
"
78,Is it hard to get a BLT in Casablanca?,"Casablanca is a city in Morocco, a country in North Africa.  While BLTs (bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches) are a common dish in many Western countries, their availability in Casablanca might be limited.  The ingredients may not be as readily accessible or commonly used in traditional Moroccan cuisine as they are in, say, the United States.  While some restaurants might offer BLTs, it's not guaranteed to be a readily available or common sandwich. Therefore, it could be considered relatively difficult to find a BLT in Casablanca compared to a country where it's a standard menu item.

The Pyrenees mountains are a mountain range in Southwestern Europe, with the highest peak reaching over 11,000 feet.  Therefore, a 55-foot statue would appear quite small and unimpressive next to the massive scale of the Pyrenees mountains.

Answer: {false}
"
81,Did Karl Marx influence the communist party of China?,"Karl Marx's theories of communism and historical materialism significantly shaped the ideology and early development of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  While the CCP adapted and modified Marxist-Leninist principles to suit the unique conditions of China,  the core tenets of class struggle, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the ultimate goal of a communist society are all rooted in Marx's writings.  Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders explicitly drew upon and interpreted Marx's works, even if their practical application of those ideas diverged in significant ways from what Marx himself might have envisioned. Therefore, Marx's influence on the CCP is undeniable, even if it's a complex and multifaceted historical relationship.

86,Did the first Duke of Valentinois play a key role in the Hundred Years' War?,"The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was a series of conflicts between England and France.  The first Duke of Valentinois, Cesare Borgia (1475-1507), lived significantly *after* this period.  His life and career fall well within the Italian Renaissance and involved Italian politics, not the Hundred Years' War.  Therefore, he could not have played a role in it.

In the Wheel of Fortune bonus round, the player is given some letters to start with, and the rest must be guessed.  Whether or not ""TH"" is considered a ""freebie"" depends on whether it's already provided in the initial letters or if they are able to guess it easily based on the context of the puzzle.  There's no guarantee ""TH"" will be a given letter or easily guessed. Therefore, it cannot be definitively labeled a ""freebie"".

98,Did Ada Lovelace die tragically young for her era?,"Ada Lovelace died at the age of 36 in 1852.  While 36 is not exceptionally young by today's standards, the average lifespan in the 1850s was significantly shorter than it is today.  Death at 36 in that era would be considered relatively young, especially given the lack of advancements in medicine and healthcare that are prevalent today. Therefore, her death at that age could be considered tragically young for her era.

100,Can someone sell their time through the Toronto Star?,"The Toronto Star is a major Canadian newspaper.  Newspapers often have classified advertising sections where individuals can advertise services.  While the Toronto Star might not explicitly have a section dedicated to selling one's time, the classifieds or online classified sections could be used to advertise services that involve selling one's time, such as tutoring, freelance work, or consulting.  Therefore, it's plausible that someone could use the Toronto Star to sell their time, albeit indirectly.

109,Would Alexander Graham Bell hypothetically support Nazi eugenics?,"Answer: Alexander Graham Bell's work focused on communication technology, not racial ideology.  While his views on eugenics were complex and involved his concern about deafness and hereditary traits, there's no evidence suggesting he would have supported the Nazi's specifically.  Nazi eugenics was a far more extreme and explicitly genocidal program than what Bell advocated. He may have had some unfortunate views, but there's no direct link to support the claim he would have supported the Nazi regime's application of eugenics.

"
113,Was Achilles a direct descendent of Gaia?,"Achilles' lineage is traced back through a complex family tree in Greek mythology.  His mother was Thetis, a sea nymph, and his father was Peleus, a king.  Thetis herself was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, sea deities.  While Nereus' parentage isn't explicitly stated in all accounts, he's often depicted as a primordial Titan or a member of the first generation of gods.  Gaia, the primordial earth goddess, is the ancestor of many of the Titans and other primordial deities.  Therefore, while not a direct lineal descendant in a simple, easily traceable way, Achilles' ancestry connects back through various generations to Gaia through his mother's lineage.  The connection is indirect but ultimately through a chain of mythological parents, leading back to the very origins of the Greek pantheon.

117,Does the swastika have positive uses?,"Answer: The swastika is an ancient symbol with origins predating Nazi Germany.  In many Asian cultures, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, it represents auspiciousness, good luck, and spirituality.  However, due to its association with Nazism and the Holocaust, its use is overwhelmingly negative and offensive in the West.  While the symbol itself had positive connotations before its appropriation by the Nazis, its current usage almost universally evokes images of hate and genocide. Therefore, while it *had* positive uses historically, those uses are extremely overshadowed by its current overwhelmingly negative context.

118,Was Black fly upstaged by another insect in Jeff Goldblum's 1986 film?,"The 1986 film featuring Jeff Goldblum is ""The Fly"".  The film centers on the transformation of Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) into a human-fly hybrid.  While the fly is central to the plot, there isn't another insect that could be considered to have ""upstaged"" it. The film's narrative focuses on Brundle's metamorphosis and the resulting horror. Therefore, the answer is false.

120,Do all cancer patients get disability?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:  Disability benefits are not automatically granted to all cancer patients.  Eligibility depends on several factors, including the severity and impact of the cancer on the individual's ability to work.  The process involves applying for disability benefits through the relevant agencies (such as Social Security Administration in the US) and demonstrating a significant inability to perform substantial gainful activity due to the cancer and its associated treatment.  Many cancer patients are able to continue working, even during treatment, and thus would not qualify for disability.

"
125,Are there enough Jonny Cash records in the world to give one to each French citizen?,"To answer this question, we need to estimate the number of Johnny Cash records ever produced and compare it to the population of France.  Finding precise figures for the total number of Johnny Cash records ever produced (including albums, singles, and various formats) is difficult and would likely require extensive research across numerous record labels and archives.  Similarly, the French population fluctuates.

However, it's highly improbable that the total number of Johnny Cash records ever manufactured, even considering all formats and re-releases over his career, would exceed the population of France (which is in the tens of millions).  While Johnny Cash was a highly popular and influential artist, the sheer number of French citizens greatly outweighs the likely number of physical copies of his records ever produced.

Answer: {false}
"
126,Could someone mistake the smell of your brussels sprouts for a fart?,"The smell of cooked Brussels sprouts, especially when overcooked, can be quite pungent and sulfurous.  This is due to the sulfur-containing compounds they release during cooking.  The smell of flatulence (fart) also often contains sulfurous compounds.  Therefore, it's plausible that someone unfamiliar with the smell of cooked Brussels sprouts might mistake it for a fart, especially if the smell is strong and the source is not immediately apparent.

Answer: {true}
"
127,Can Stone Cold Steve Austin apply his finisher to a mule deer?,"Stone Cold Steve Austin's finisher, the Stone Cold Stunner, involves a quick, surprising over-the-shoulder back-body drop.  While it's theoretically possible to perform the physical actions of the move on a mule deer, the size and unpredictable nature of the animal make it highly improbable and dangerous.  The move would likely result in injury to both Steve Austin and the deer.  Therefore, while the *physical actions* might be possible, the successful application of the move as a wrestling finisher is not.

Answer: {false}

131,Did the swallow play a role in a famous film about King Arthur?,"The film ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" famously features a scene where the characters discuss the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow.  This is a comedic scene, but it is directly related to the plot as the characters are seeking the Holy Grail and encounter various absurd situations.  Therefore, a swallow plays a significant, albeit comedic, role in a famous film about King Arthur.

Answer: {true}
"
132,Was Michael Crichton ever in danger of flunking out of Harvard as an undergraduate?,"Michael Crichton attended Harvard Medical School, not Harvard College (undergraduate).  While he did leave Harvard Medical School before completing his degree, that's not the same as flunking out of Harvard as an *undergraduate*.  He was a successful Harvard undergraduate student, receiving high marks in literature and anthropology.  Therefore, the statement about him being in danger of flunking out as an undergraduate is false.

135,Did the Coen brothers ever collaborate with the Brothers Grimm?,"The Coen brothers are a filmmaking duo known for their collaborations on films like ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski.""  The Brothers Grimm were a pair of German academics, linguists, cultural researchers, and authors known for collecting and publishing fairy tales.  The Coen brothers are contemporary filmmakers; the Brothers Grimm lived and worked in the early 19th century.  Therefore, it's impossible for them to have collaborated.

136,Could a hundred thousand lolcats fit on a first generation iPhone?,"The first-generation iPhone had 4GB or 8GB of storage.  Let's assume the average lolcat image, including metadata, is about 1MB in size (this is a generous estimate, many could be smaller, especially if compressed).  This means a 4GB iPhone could hold approximately 4000 lolcats (4096 MB / 1 MB per lolcat), and an 8GB iPhone could hold approximately 8000 lolcats. 100,000 lolcats vastly exceeds the storage capacity of a first-generation iPhone.

Answer: {false}
"
141,Is one blast from double-barreled shotgun likely to kill all squid brains?,"Explanation:
A double-barreled shotgun fires two shots simultaneously.  The lethality of a shotgun blast depends heavily on range and the size/type of shot used.  Even at close range, a single blast might not guarantee the death of all squid in a group, let alone all their brains.  Squid are relatively small, and depending on their size and the spread of the shot, some might survive.  Furthermore, the shotgun blast might injure but not kill some squid.  There's no guarantee of a complete kill for every squid.

Answer: {false}
"
142,Do women often need new shoes during their pregnancy?,"Explanation: During pregnancy, a woman's feet can swell due to fluid retention.  This swelling can make existing shoes uncomfortable or even painful to wear.  Additionally, hormonal changes can cause ligaments in the feet to relax, altering the shape of the foot.  Therefore, it's common for pregnant women to require new shoes to accommodate these changes in foot size and shape.

Answer: {true}
"
143,Are some adherents to Christianity in China historic enemies of Catholic Church?,"Answer: Some adherents to Christianity in China, specifically those associated with the Chinese Independent Churches (also known as Three-Self Patriotic Movement churches), have historically been at odds with the Catholic Church.  The Chinese government promoted these independent churches, largely separating them from the Vatican's authority.  This resulted in a significant rift, with these independent churches often viewed as rivals or even enemies by the Catholic Church due to their competing claims of representing Christianity in China and their allegiance to the Chinese state rather than the Pope.  The relationship has been complex and fraught with tension, involving periods of persecution and cooperation, but there have certainly been historical periods of antagonism.

Answer: {true}

144,Is Chinese successor to Chevrolet Cruze name a town far from Milan?,"The Chevrolet Cruze's Chinese successor is the Buick Verano.  Verano is not a town, and even if it were, it's highly unlikely to be ""far from Milan"" without more specific information about a potential town named Verano.  The question relies on a false premise: that the Cruze's successor's name would be a geographic location.

Answer: {false}

145,Could the Dominican Order hypothetically defeat Blessed Gerard's order?,"The question asks whether the Dominican Order could hypothetically defeat Blessed Gerard's order.  This is a complex question because it depends entirely on how we define ""defeat.""  There's no military conflict implied, so it's not a matter of armed struggle.  Both the Dominicans and the Order of St. John of God (Blessed Gerard's order) are religious orders with different focuses and methodologies.  The Dominicans are known for their preaching, scholarship, and intellectual rigor, while the Order of St. John of God prioritizes serving the sick and the poor.

A ""defeat"" in this context could only refer to a comparative measure of influence, reach, or lasting legacy. Neither order would ""defeat"" the other in a physical or military sense.  It's entirely possible to argue that both orders have had significant and lasting impacts on the world, serving very different, yet equally valid, purposes.  Therefore, a definitive ""victory"" for either is impossible to determine.

146,Is a pottery kiln inappropriate for use with glass blowing?,"Pottery kilns are designed for firing clay at high temperatures.  Glass blowing, while also involving high temperatures, requires a different type of heat source and a more controlled environment.  Pottery kilns typically lack the precise temperature control and atmosphere necessary for glassblowing, and the kiln's construction may not be suitable for the type of glassblowing torch. Using a pottery kiln for glassblowing could damage the kiln and/or result in dangerous situations.

147,Are there enough people in the Balkans to match the population of Japan?,"The population of Japan is approximately 125 million people.  The Balkans encompass several countries, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia.  While precise population figures fluctuate, the combined population of these Balkan countries significantly less than 125 million.  Therefore, the number of people in the Balkans is not sufficient to match the population of Japan.

150,Would a Beaver's teeth rival that of a Smilodon?,"Beavers have continuously growing incisors made of enamel and dentine that are exceptionally strong and well-suited for gnawing wood.  Smilodons, or saber-toothed cats, possessed large, curved canine teeth designed for piercing and killing prey. While beaver teeth are impressive for their function, they are not comparable in size, strength (for piercing), or overall killing power to the formidable canines of a Smilodon.  The comparison is inappropriate because they serve completely different purposes.  Beaver teeth are for chewing wood, Smilodon teeth are for killing and eating large prey.

Answer: {false}

151,Is dysphoria around one's pelvis treatable without surgery?,"Answer:  Gender dysphoria, which can manifest as distress around one's body, including the pelvis, is complex and can have various underlying causes.  While surgery may be an option for some individuals, it's not the only or necessarily the first treatment.  Many approaches exist that don't involve surgery, such as hormone therapy, psychotherapy (including gender-affirming therapy), and support groups.  These methods can significantly alleviate distress associated with body image, including pelvic dysphoria. Therefore, it is treatable without surgery for many people.

152,Would members of Blue Lives Matter support every element of Grand Theft Auto III?,"Blue Lives Matter is a pro-police organization that advocates for law enforcement. Grand Theft Auto III is a video game that involves criminal activities such as grand theft auto, police chases, and violence.  Members of Blue Lives Matter would likely strongly oppose many aspects of Grand Theft Auto III, including the glorification of criminal behavior, the depiction of violence against police officers, and the disregard for the law. While there may be some aspects of the game that they might not explicitly object to (for example, aspects of vehicle mechanics), the overall themes and gameplay of GTA III are fundamentally contradictory to the values and goals of the Blue Lives Matter movement.

156,Can United States Secretary of State do crimes in U.K. without being arrested?,"The United States Secretary of State is a high-ranking government official.  However, the principle of extraterritoriality doesn't grant immunity from the laws of another country. While they might enjoy certain diplomatic protections, they are not above the law of the United Kingdom.  If the Secretary of State commits a crime in the U.K.,  they can be arrested and prosecuted according to British law, subject to any diplomatic complexities that might arise in handling the arrest and subsequent legal proceedings.

Answer: {false}
"
157,Is myocardial infarction a brain problem?,"Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a problem with the heart, not the brain.  A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. This blockage prevents the heart muscle from receiving enough oxygen, leading to damage or death of the heart tissue.  Brain problems, on the other hand, involve issues with the brain itself, such as stroke, aneurysms, or brain tumors.  These are distinct from cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction.

Answer: {false}
"
158,Will Chick Fil A be open on Halloween 2021?,"Chick-fil-A's hours of operation are generally consistent across locations, but they are not open 24/7, and they do close early on Sundays.  To definitively answer whether they were open on Halloween 2021, we'd need to check their specific hours for that date.  However, since Halloween is not a Sunday, and it's a relatively standard weekday/holiday, we can assume that most, if not all, Chick-fil-A locations *would have been* open, though perhaps with adjusted hours.  Without specific confirmation for a given location, we cannot be certain.

Answer: {Likely true}
"
159,Was  Godfrey of Bouillon an Islamaphobe?,"Godfrey of Bouillon was a prominent leader during the First Crusade. While the Crusades were undeniably marked by violence and conflict with Muslims, judging Godfrey's personal beliefs based solely on his participation is problematic.  Historical sources offer limited insight into his private views on Islam or Muslims as individuals.  His actions as a military leader during the Crusades were within the context of a religious war, a complex and brutal period in history, and do not definitively prove personal animosity towards Islam.  It's important to avoid anachronistically projecting modern concepts of Islamophobia onto a medieval figure.  His motivations, and those of other crusaders, were far more nuanced than simple prejudice, encompassing religious zeal, political ambition, and economic opportunity. Therefore, definitively labeling him as an ""Islamophobe"" is an oversimplification and potentially inaccurate.

Answer: {false}
"
160,Is an espresso likely to assuage fear?,"Espresso contains caffeine, a stimulant.  While caffeine can sometimes provide a temporary boost in energy and alertness, it's not known to directly alleviate or assuage fear.  Fear is a complex emotional response often linked to the amygdala and other brain regions involved in processing threat.  Caffeine's effects primarily relate to the central nervous system, affecting alertness and energy levels, but not necessarily directly targeting the fear response.  Therefore, it's unlikely that an espresso would effectively reduce fear.

Answer: {false}
"
161,If you add water to rice pudding is it horchata?,"Horchata is a traditional beverage, typically made with rice, water, sugar, and cinnamon.  While rice pudding and horchata both contain rice and water, rice pudding is a dessert typically made with milk, sugar, and often other ingredients like vanilla or raisins.  It's a thick, creamy dish, whereas horchata is a thin, refreshing drink. The key difference lies in the consistency and intended purpose. Therefore, adding water to rice pudding does not make it horchata.

162,Did Bill Gates achieve Latin honors?,"Bill Gates attended Harvard University but did not graduate.  While he excelled academically, there's no record indicating he achieved Latin honors (cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude).  To receive Latin honors, a student typically needs to maintain a very high GPA throughout their undergraduate studies and graduate. Since Bill Gates left Harvard before completing his degree, he wouldn't have been eligible for Latin honors.

"
167,Does the word swastika have meaning in sanskrit?,"The word ""swastika"" is derived from Sanskrit.  In Sanskrit, ""su"" means ""good"" or ""well,"" and ""asti"" means ""to be"" or ""exists.""  Therefore, ""svastika"" literally translates to ""being good"" or ""it is good"" or something similar depending on the exact grammatical interpretation.  While the modern association of the swastika is almost universally negative due to its appropriation by the Nazi party, its original meaning in Sanskrit was positive.

Answer: {true}
"
168,Did Sony definitively win the video game war against Sega?,"The ""video game war"" between Sega and Sony is a complex issue with no single definitive winner.  While Sony's PlayStation ultimately achieved greater market share and longevity, Sega's Genesis/Mega Drive had significant success and a dedicated following.  The competition spurred innovation in both companies, benefiting the gaming industry as a whole.  Neither company decisively ""won"" in a way that could be universally agreed upon.  The term ""video game war"" itself is a simplification of a multifaceted rivalry.

169,Would an ethics professor teach a class on Cezanne?,"An ethics professor's expertise lies in moral philosophy, ethical theories, and applied ethics.  While an ethics professor might appreciate art, Cezanne's work is primarily a subject within art history or art appreciation.  There's no inherent connection between Cezanne's paintings and the field of ethics that would warrant an ethics professor teaching a class specifically on him.  An art history professor would be far more appropriate.

"
175,Would Dante have hypothetically placed Nostradamus in 3rd Circle of Hell?,"Dante's Inferno places the gluttonous in the Third Circle of Hell.  While Nostradamus's life doesn't suggest excessive gluttony as a defining characteristic, there's no direct evidence to place him in any specific circle.  The placement is entirely speculative based on interpretations of his life and actions, and there's no basis to assume Dante would have considered him particularly gluttonous.

Answer: {false}
"
176,Was Mercedes-Benz associated with the Nazis?,"Mercedes-Benz's parent company, Daimler-Benz, was deeply intertwined with the Nazi regime.  During the Third Reich, the company produced military vehicles and utilized forced labor from concentration camps.  While the extent of direct involvement by the company's leadership is a complex and debated topic, the undeniable use of slave labor and contribution to the Nazi war machine firmly links Mercedes-Benz's pre-war history to the regime.

182,Is it safe to eat kidney?,"Kidney is a food source consumed in many cultures around the world.  However, the safety of eating kidney depends on several factors, including the animal's health, proper preparation, and the individual's health conditions.  

Concerns exist regarding potential contamination with bacteria, toxins, or heavy metals if the animal wasn't raised or slaughtered under sanitary conditions.  Additionally, kidneys are organs that filter waste products from the blood, and therefore contain higher concentrations of purines which break down into uric acid.  For individuals with gout or kidney disease, consuming high-purine foods like kidney can exacerbate their conditions.  Finally, thorough cooking is essential to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.


Answer: {It's not inherently unsafe, but there are risks associated with eating kidney that depend on various factors.}
"
183,Do shrimp taste best when cooked for a long time?,"Shrimp is a delicate protein that cooks quickly. Overcooking shrimp leads to rubbery, tough texture.  The ideal cooking time is short, ensuring it remains tender and juicy.  Therefore, long cooking times are not ideal.

190,Are all Wednesdays in a year enough to read Bible 15 times?,"There are 52 weeks in a year, meaning there are 52 Wednesdays.  If someone were to read the Bible 15 times in a year, they would need to read it once every 52/15 = 3.47 weeks.  Since there are 7 days in a week, this equates to reading the Bible approximately 24.3 days. That's less than a day per reading.  Therefore, having 52 Wednesdays to read the Bible would be far more than sufficient to read it 15 times.

Answer: {true}

195,Are Brussels sprout particularly good for adrenal fatigue?,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that Brussels sprouts are particularly good for adrenal fatigue.  Adrenal fatigue is not a medically recognized condition, although some people experience symptoms associated with adrenal insufficiency or other hormonal imbalances.  While Brussels sprouts are a nutritious vegetable packed with vitamins and minerals, there's no research indicating they specifically target or treat the symptoms often associated with what is called ""adrenal fatigue.""  Therefore, any purported benefit would be anecdotal and not based on scientific evidence.

198,Is Shiva's divine dance an ancient physical fitness pose?,"Shiva's Tandava, or cosmic dance, is a significant motif in Hindu art and mythology, representing creation and destruction.  While it's depicted in dynamic, physically demanding poses,  it's not a codified physical fitness pose in the same way as modern yoga asanas or other exercise routines.  It's a symbolic representation with spiritual meaning, not a set of exercises designed for physical fitness.  The poses depicted might inspire movement or be incorporated into dance or yoga, but it's not its primary purpose.

"
200,Did Medieval English lords engage in fair trade with peasants?,"Medieval English lords did not engage in fair trade with peasants.  The relationship between lords and peasants was fundamentally unequal and exploitative.  The manorial system, which dominated the medieval period, saw peasants working the lord's land in exchange for protection and the right to cultivate a small plot of land for their own subsistence. However, the terms were heavily skewed in favor of the lord.  Peasants often paid high rents, worked numerous days in labor services for the lord (often far exceeding what was a fair exchange for their own meager plots), and were subject to various other dues and obligations.  This system was far from fair trade; it was a system of feudal obligation and extraction of surplus from the peasantry.  While some individual lords might have been more lenient than others, the system itself inherently lacked fairness.

Answer: {false}
"
201,Paleography hypothetically helps to understand Cthulhu?,"Paleography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting.  Cthulhu, a fictional cosmic entity from H.P.

Answer: {false}
"
202,Have jokes killed more people than rats in history?,"Explanation:

There's no reliable data on the exact number of deaths caused by rats throughout history.  Rat-borne diseases like the plague have killed millions.  Jokes, on the other hand, haven't directly caused deaths on a comparable scale. While laughter can be physically strenuous in extreme cases (though rarely fatal), it's highly improbable that jokes have caused even a fraction of the deaths attributed to rats and the diseases they carry.

Answer: {false}
"
203,Is slitting your wrists an unreliable suicide method?,"Slitting one's wrists is not a reliable method of suicide.  While it can cause significant injury and even death, the process is often prolonged and painful, and there is no guarantee of success.  Furthermore, significant blood loss can lead to complications and potential for rescue before death occurs.  Many people who attempt suicide by this method survive with severe injuries.  Therefore, it's considered an unreliable and unpredictable method.

Answer: {true}
"
204,Is the rise of agriculture attributed to rivers?,"The rise of agriculture is strongly linked to the presence of rivers.  Rivers provided a reliable source of water for irrigation, crucial for cultivating crops.  The fertile alluvial soil deposited by rivers also created ideal conditions for farming.  Furthermore, rivers served as transportation routes, facilitating trade and the spread of agricultural techniques. While other factors contributed to the development of agriculture, the availability of water and fertile land provided by rivers played a significant role in its emergence and expansion.

Answer: {true}
"
205,Do the Eskimos sunbathe frequently?,"Eskimos, or Inuit, live in regions with limited sunlight, especially during winter months.

"
207,Is a thousand dollars per Days of Our Lives episodes preferred to other soaps?,"The question asks if paying $1000 per episode of Days of Our Lives is preferred over other soap operas.  This question cannot be answered definitively.  The preference for a soap opera is subjective and depends on individual tastes.  The cost per episode is irrelevant to whether someone prefers Days of Our Lives to other soaps.  A person might love Days of Our Lives but not be willing to pay $1000 per episode, while another might prefer a different soap opera regardless of cost. The question mixes unrelated concepts.

Answer: {false}
"
208,Does Pikachu like Charles Darwin?,"Pikachu is a fictional character from the Pokémon franchise, and Charles Darwin was a real historical figure, the father of evolutionary theory.

210,Can a grey seal swim in the same water as the subject of Moby Dick?,"Moby Dick, the whale in the Herman Melville novel, is a sperm whale.  Grey seals are marine mammals that inhabit colder waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sperm whales also inhabit a wide range of ocean environments.  Therefore, it's possible for a grey seal and a sperm whale to occupy overlapping habitats and swim in the same water.

211,Will Donald Duck hypothetically purchase bell-bottoms for himself?,"Answer: Donald Duck is an anthropomorphic duck who is known for his sailor outfit.  Bell-bottoms were popular in the 1970s, a period relevant to Donald Duck's appearances in cartoons. Although his usual attire doesn't include bell-bottoms, there's no reason to assume he wouldn't hypothetically purchase them if he wanted to.

Answer: {true}
"
212,Do people put creatures from the Black Sea on their pizza?,"The question asks whether people put creatures from the Black Sea on their pizza.  There's no common culinary practice of using Black Sea creatures as pizza toppings. While various seafoods are used on pizzas, there's no indication that Black Sea specific creatures are commonly included.  The Black Sea has a unique ecosystem, and while some of its fish might be edible, it's highly unlikely they'd be a widely used pizza topping.

Answer: {false}
"
213,Are there special traffic laws associated with funerals?,"Many jurisdictions have laws or established practices related to funeral processions. These often involve allowing the procession to proceed through intersections without stopping, even against red lights. However, this is typically done under the supervision of police or other designated personnel to ensure public safety.  While there are accommodations made for funeral processions, there isn't a distinct, separate set of traffic laws specifically *for* funerals.  The allowances made are more about temporary exceptions to general traffic rules with safety measures in place, not a new legal code.

Answer: {false}
"
214,Can I find my home with latitude and longitude?,"Latitude and longitude coordinates specify a precise point on the Earth's surface.

Therefore, it's impossible to definitively answer the question.

Answer: {false}
"
216,Can you get a fever from consuming meat?,"Consuming meat itself does not directly cause a fever.  Fevers are a symptom of the body's immune response to infection or illness.  While contaminated meat can contain bacteria or pathogens (like Salmonella or E. coli) that can *cause* illness leading to a fever, the meat itself isn't the cause of the fever; it's the infection.  

Answer: {false}
"
217,Is eating a Dicopomorpha echmepterygis size Uranium pellet fatal?,"The question asks whether consuming a uranium pellet the size of a *Dicopomorpha echmepterygis* insect would be fatal.  To answer this, we need to consider the toxicity of uranium and the size of the insect.

Uranium is a radioactive heavy metal. Even small amounts of ingested uranium can be toxic, causing acute radiation sickness and long-term health problems, including cancer. The severity of the effects depends on several factors, including the amount ingested, the chemical form of the uranium, and the individual's health.

*Dicopomorpha echmepterygis* is a species of planthopper.  While the exact size varies, planthoppers are generally small insects, measuring only a few millimeters in length.  A uranium pellet this size would contain a relatively small amount of uranium, likely insufficient to cause immediate death in an adult human.  However, even a small amount of ingested uranium is dangerous and could cause serious long-term health problems.  The pellet's size could also affect the ease of ingestion and absorption into the body, with potentially different consequences compared to a larger ingested quantity of uranium.

Therefore, while immediate death may not be guaranteed, consuming such a pellet would be extremely hazardous and likely result in severe illness and long-term health complications.

236,Is lunch on the beach a good activity to spot the full circle of a rainbow?,"Rainbows are optical and meteorological phenomena that require specific conditions to be fully visible.  A full circle rainbow requires the sun to be relatively low in the sky and the observer to be positioned with the sun at their back, and ideally with water droplets suspended in the air at a suitable distance and density all around them.  A beach is likely to have water droplets in the air from the ocean, but the sun's position relative to the beach will not always permit the full circle to be seen, as some of the rainbow will be below the horizon line. While the beach provides moisture from ocean spray, it does not guarantee the ideal viewing conditions for a full-circle rainbow.

Answer: {false}

243,Can Ford F-350 tow entire Yale University student body?,"To determine if a Ford F-350 could tow the entire Yale University student body, we need to estimate the weight of the student body and compare it to the towing capacity of the truck.

* **Yale University Student Body Weight:**  Yale has approximately 12,000 undergraduate students.  Let's assume an average student weight of 150 pounds (this is a rough estimate and could vary).  The total weight would be 12,000 students * 150 pounds/student = 1,800,000 pounds.  This doesn't account for graduate students, faculty, or staff, so the actual weight would be significantly higher.

* **Ford F-350 Towing Capacity:** The towing capacity of a Ford F-350 varies depending on the specific model and configuration, but it generally ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 pounds.  Even the highest capacity is far less than 1,800,000 pounds.

Therefore, a Ford F-350 is not capable of towing the entire Yale University student body.  The weight of the student body alone, using conservative estimates, far exceeds the towing capacity of the truck.  Adding in faculty and staff makes the task impossible.

256,Would an environmentalist advocate for preventing domestic canine reproduction?,"Environmentalists often advocate for reducing the environmental impact of pet ownership,  including the carbon footprint associated with breeding and raising dogs.  However,  a blanket advocacy for preventing *all* domestic canine reproduction is unlikely.  While some extreme environmentalists might hold this view, the vast majority would focus on promoting responsible pet ownership practices (like spaying/neutering, adopting rather than breeding, reducing meat consumption associated with dog food) rather than outright banning reproduction.  The focus is usually on minimizing the overall impact, not eliminating it completely.

"
257,Does Iphone have more iterations than Samsung Galaxy?,"To determine whether iPhones have more iterations than Samsung Galaxy phones, we need to consider the number of distinct models released by each company.  Both Apple (iPhone) and Samsung (Galaxy) have released numerous phone models over the years, with variations in screen size, processing power, and features within each generation.  Precise counts are difficult to obtain and depend on how one defines an ""iteration"" (e.g., counting minor variations like storage capacity as separate iterations or not). However, given Samsung's wide range of models across various price points and their frequent release cycles compared to Apple, it's highly likely that Samsung Galaxy phones have had more iterations than iPhones.  While Apple consistently focuses on a smaller number of high-end models per year, Samsung targets a broader market with many variations.

261,Did brother of Goofy creator's employer commit an excommunicable offense?,"The question asks whether the employer of Goofy's creator's brother committed an excommunicable offense.  To answer this, we need to know:

1. **Who created Goofy?**  Goofy was created by Walt Disney.
2. **Did Walt Disney have a brother?**  Walt Disney had a brother, Roy O. Disney.
3. **What was Roy O. Disney's employer?** Roy O. Disney worked alongside his brother at the Walt Disney Company.  The Walt Disney Company itself would be his employer.
4. **What constitutes an excommunicable offense?** This depends entirely on the religious context.  Excommunication is a religious penalty, not a secular one.  There is no standard definition of an ""excommunicable offense"" that applies universally across all religions.  It would need to be a grave sin or violation of religious law that warrants expulsion from the community.

Without knowing which religion's definition of an excommunicable offense is being applied and if the Walt Disney Company had any activities that would be considered such an offense according to that religion, the question cannot be answered. There is no information presented to indicate any such offense.

272,Is someone more likely to survive having breast cancer in Japan than in Sweden?,"Breast cancer survival rates are influenced by a complex interplay of factors including early detection rates, access to quality healthcare, treatment protocols, and overall healthcare infrastructure. While both Japan and Sweden boast excellent healthcare systems, direct comparison of survival rates requires detailed, comparable data across studies.  There isn't a readily available, universally accepted conclusion that definitively states one country consistently has higher survival rates than the other.  Reliable data would need to account for differences in cancer staging at diagnosis, treatment approaches used, and population demographics.  Any observed difference might also be due to reporting biases or differences in data collection methodologies.  Therefore, a conclusive statement about whether survival is definitively better in Japan versus Sweden cannot be made based on readily available information.

273,Did Irish mythology inspire Washington Irving?,"Washington Irving, a key figure in American Romanticism, drew heavily from European folklore and legends in his works.  While he wasn't directly inspired by Irish mythology in the same way he might have been by, say, German folklore, the broader context of European mythology and folklore, which includes elements of Celtic mythology (of which Irish mythology is a significant part), undoubtedly influenced his writing style and themes.  His focus on the supernatural, the romantic idealization of the past, and the exploration of national identity all connect to broader European romantic traditions that have roots in Celtic mythology and storytelling.  It's not a direct and easily traceable influence, but it's certainly part of the broader tapestry of inspiration behind his works.

276,Can a minor replicate the double-slit experiment?,"The double-slit experiment requires a basic understanding of wave-particle duality and some precision in setting up the apparatus.  While a minor could conceptually grasp the experiment's purpose and observe the results, successfully replicating it with reliable, measurable results would be challenging.  The setup requires careful control of light sources (lasers are often used for better results), precise slit spacing, a stable measurement screen, and possibly specialized detectors to observe the interference patterns.  The experiment also requires a certain level of attention to detail and understanding of the principles of experimental design.   While a minor *could* attempt the experiment using readily available materials like a laser pointer and cardboard, the likelihood of obtaining scientifically meaningful results is low without proper supervision and equipment.

288,Will Gremlins sequels tie number of Matrix sequels?,"Explanation:
There are two Gremlins sequels: Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and the planned Gremlins 3 (which has yet to be released).  The Matrix franchise has four films: The Matrix (1999), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), The Matrix Revolutions (2003), and The Matrix Resurrections (2021). Therefore, the number of Matrix sequels (3) exceeds the number of Gremlins sequels (1).  The question asks if they *tie*, meaning are equal in number.

He's a brilliant engineer, inventor, and physicist, responsible for creating advanced technologies and the Iron Man suit. He also demonstrates business acumen as the CEO of Stark Industries and showcases significant skills in areas such as artificial intelligence and energy sources.  His abilities extend beyond the purely scientific and technical realms, encompassing leadership and tactical prowess.  While he may not be a master in every single field, his exceptional proficiency across numerous disciplines strongly supports classifying him as a polymath.

290,Can any person with a driver's license work in transport of aviation fuel?,"The question asks if anyone with a driver's license can work in aviation fuel transport.  This is false.  Transporting aviation fuel involves specialized handling, safety regulations, and likely requires specific training and certifications beyond simply possessing a driver's license.  Driving a vehicle to transport the fuel is only one small aspect;  the handling and safety procedures for such hazardous materials are much more stringent. Therefore, a simple driver's license is insufficient qualification.

292,Does open heart surgery finish before entirety of American Ballet Theatre's Swan Lake?,"Open heart surgery typically takes several hours, perhaps 4-8 hours depending on the complexity.  The American Ballet Theatre's production of Swan Lake is a full-length ballet lasting approximately 3-4 hours.  Therefore, it's plausible that an open heart surgery could finish before a full performance of Swan Lake. However,  the exact duration of both varies. The surgery could potentially run longer than the performance, especially if complications arise.

"
296,Is Antarctica a good location for Groundhog Day?,"Groundhog Day traditionally relies on the emergence of a groundhog from its burrow to predict the arrival of spring.  This requires a groundhog population, suitable hibernation conditions, and a climate where the ground regularly freezes and thaws. Antarctica has a very cold climate, perpetually frozen ground, and lacks a groundhog population. Therefore, it is not a suitable location for Groundhog Day.

Answer: {false}
"
297,Does the density of helium cause voices to sound deeper?,"Helium is less dense than air.  When someone inhales helium, their vocal cords vibrate faster because the lighter gas offers less resistance. This higher frequency results in a higher-pitched voice, not a deeper one.

Answer: {false}
"
298,Can petroleum jelly be used as fuel in a car?,"Petroleum jelly, or Vaseline, is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons. While it's derived from petroleum, it's not refined in the same way as gasoline or diesel fuel.  It has a much higher viscosity and doesn't vaporize easily, meaning it wouldn't atomize properly in a car's engine to combust efficiently.  Attempting to use it as fuel would likely clog the fuel lines and damage the engine. Therefore, it cannot be used as fuel in a car.

Answer: {false}
"
299,Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?,"There's no objective measure to determine the ""most prevalent"" sin.  The Seven Deadly Sins (pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth) are theological concepts, not empirically measurable phenomena.  Their prevalence would vary across individuals, cultures, and time periods.  While some might argue that greed is particularly prevalent in modern society,  this is subjective and lacks verifiable data.  It's impossible to definitively say one is ""most prevalent"" over others.

301,Do drag kings take testosterone to look masculine?,"Drag kings are performers who dress and act in stereotypically masculine ways.  While some drag kings might use testosterone or other hormones to enhance their masculine appearance, it's not a requirement or universal practice.  Many achieve their look through other means like costuming, makeup, padding, and body language.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say all or most drag kings take testosterone.

302,Do all crustaceans live in the ocean?,"Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods that includes crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and crayfish.  While many crustaceans are indeed marine animals, living in the ocean,  many others inhabit freshwater environments like rivers and lakes.  Some species even live on land. Therefore, not all crustaceans live in the ocean.

"
303,Would Paul Bunyan hypothetically be a poor choice for an urban planner?,"Paul Bunyan is a mythical lumberjack of enormous size and strength, known for his feats of deforestation and earth-moving.  His methods are characterized by massive scale and disregard for the complexities of urban planning.  He'd likely favor solutions involving brute force and large-scale alterations rather than intricate design and community consideration.  An urban planner needs finesse, attention to detail, consideration for existing infrastructure and community needs, and an understanding of sustainable practices, none of which are hallmarks of Paul Bunyan's legendary exploits.  Therefore, he would be a remarkably poor choice for an urban planner.

Answer: {true}
"
304,Can sunlight travel to the deepest part of the Black Sea?,"Explanation:
The Black Sea's maximum depth is approximately 7,250 feet (2,210 meters).  Sunlight penetrates water, but its intensity decreases exponentially with depth.  The depth at which sunlight becomes insufficient for photosynthesis (the euphotic zone) varies depending on water clarity, but it's generally within the top few hundred feet.  Beyond that depth, the Black Sea is essentially dark. Therefore, sunlight cannot reach the deepest part of the Black Sea.

Answer: {false}

"
308,Is Thanksgiving sometimes considered a day of mourning?,"Thanksgiving, a holiday celebrating the harvest and traditionally commemorating the relationship between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag, is viewed by some Native American groups as a day of mourning.  This perspective stems from the historical context of colonization, displacement, and the immense suffering inflicted upon Indigenous peoples following European arrival in North America.  The ""harvest"" celebrated was often achieved at the expense of Native American lives and land.  Therefore, for many Native Americans, Thanksgiving serves as a stark reminder of a traumatic past rather than a cause for celebration.

310,Is Noah's Ark an upgrade for Golden Age of Piracy pirates?,"Noah's Ark is a biblical vessel designed for survival during a great flood, offering protection from the water and the elements.  Golden Age of Piracy pirates, on the other hand, were seafaring criminals who primarily sought plunder and wealth. While a larger, more seaworthy vessel might have been beneficial to pirates, Noah's Ark's purpose is fundamentally different and its design wouldn't inherently improve the capabilities of a pirate ship in terms of raiding, speed, or stealth.

Answer: {false}
"
311,Are two cans of Campbell's Soup a day good for hypertension?,"Answer: Campbell's Soup, particularly condensed varieties, is often high in sodium.  High sodium intake is a significant contributor to hypertension (high blood pressure).  Consuming two cans daily would dramatically increase sodium consumption, likely worsening hypertension rather than improving it.  A diet low in sodium is recommended for managing hypertension. Therefore, two cans of Campbell's Soup a day are not good for hypertension.

314,Can a sniper shoot a fish past Bathypelagic Zone in ocean?,"The bathypelagic zone is the part of the ocean between 1,000 and 4,000 meters (3,300 and 13,100 feet) deep.  A sniper rifle, even with extremely powerful ammunition, would not have the range to reach a fish at that depth.  The water itself would significantly impede the bullet's trajectory and severely reduce its effective range.  Even if the bullet were to somehow reach that depth, the pressure at such a depth would likely cause the bullet to deform or disintegrate before it could hit a fish.

Answer: {false}
"
315,Were Depeche Mode heavily influenced by blues music?,"Depeche Mode's music is primarily categorized as synth-pop, electronic, and new wave.  Their sound is heavily reliant on synthesizers and electronic instrumentation, rather than the guitars and vocal styles characteristic of blues music. While individual band members may have had personal exposure to blues, it's not considered a significant influence on the overall sound and style of Depeche Mode's music.

"
316,Do you need lactobacillus to make pickles?,"Lactobacillus is a genus of bacteria commonly used in fermentation processes, including the fermentation of pickles.  Pickles are made through lactic acid fermentation, where lactobacillus bacteria convert sugars into lactic acid, creating a sour and acidic environment that inhibits the growth of spoilage organisms and preserves the vegetables.  While other bacteria can contribute to the fermentation process, lactobacillus is a key player and is essential for creating the characteristic flavor and preserving the pickles.

Answer: {true}
"
317,Did King James I despise fairy beings?,"King James I is known for his authorship of *Daemonologie*, a treatise explicitly detailing his belief in and fear of witchcraft and demonic entities.  While the book doesn't directly address fairies in the same way it addresses witches and demons,  his worldview heavily emphasized a belief in the supernatural, and fairies, being supernatural beings, would likely have fallen under his disapproval based on his documented views about the dangers and malevolence of the spirit world.  His strong religious beliefs and anxieties about the influence of evil would likely extend to encompass beings like fairies.

Answer: {true}
"
318,Is dyslexia the most common intellectual disability in US?,"Dyslexia is a learning disability that affects reading ability, not an intellectual disability. Intellectual disabilities encompass a broader range of cognitive impairments, including limitations in reasoning, problem-solving, and adaptive behavior. While dyslexia is a prevalent learning disability, it's not classified as an intellectual disability.  Therefore, it cannot be the *most* common intellectual disability.  Many other conditions, such as Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome, are considered intellectual disabilities and affect cognitive function more broadly than dyslexia.

Answer: {false}
"
319,Do Bing (search engine) searches earn the searcher more than competitors do?,"Bing's market share is significantly smaller than Google's.  Therefore, while Bing does offer rewards programs and points for searches, the overall earning potential for a searcher using Bing compared to Google (or other search engines) is likely to be lower due to the reduced opportunities presented by a smaller market.  There's no evidence suggesting Bing pays more overall to searchers.

322,Was Great Recession the period of severest unemployment?,"The Great Recession, which officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, saw a significant spike in unemployment.  However, determining if it was the *severest* period of unemployment in US history requires comparing it to other periods of high unemployment, such as the Great Depression.  While the Great Recession resulted in a high unemployment rate (peaking at around 10%), the Great Depression saw far higher rates, exceeding 20% for several years. Therefore, the Great Recession was a period of severe unemployment, but not the severest in US history.

324,Would a week be enough time to watch every episode of Ugly Betty?,"Ugly Betty has four seasons, with 85 episodes in total.  Assuming an average episode length of 44 minutes (a reasonable estimate), watching all episodes would take approximately 61 hours and 40 minutes (85 episodes * 44 minutes/episode).  There are 168 hours in a week.  Therefore, there is sufficient time within a week to watch all episodes of Ugly Betty, even accounting for some breaks.

326,Was Pi an acceptable number of children in 1980s China?,"Answer: The one-child policy in China was implemented in 1979 and lasted until 2015.  This policy limited most families to having only one child.  Pi (π) is approximately 3.14159, which is more than one. Therefore, having a number of children equal to Pi would have violated the one-child policy in the 1980s.

While she is unconscious, a prince kisses her, effectively violating her body and agency.  This act, regardless of the happily-ever-after ending, is a clear example of non-consensual behavior.  Therefore, Snow White is not an example of good consent.

Answer: {false}
"
331,Is The Invisible Man more prevalent in films than Picnic at Hanging Rock?,"To determine which film is more prevalent, we need to consider the number of adaptations and the overall presence in popular culture.  ""The Invisible Man"" has been adapted numerous times across various media (film, television, etc.), consistently appearing in different versions throughout cinematic history.  ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" while a significant and influential film, has had far fewer adaptations and a smaller overall cultural impact compared to ""The Invisible Man."" Therefore, ""The Invisible Man"" has a more substantial and persistent presence in films.

"
335,Do Chinese Americans face discrimination at a Federal level in the US?,"Answer: The history of the United States includes periods of significant anti-Chinese sentiment and discriminatory legislation at the federal level.  While overt, explicitly anti-Chinese laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act are no longer in effect, the legacy of systemic racism and implicit bias can still contribute to discrimination against Chinese Americans in various aspects of federal policies and institutions. This could manifest in areas like employment, housing, access to education, and interactions with law enforcement. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Chinese Americans do face forms of discrimination at a federal level, though it's likely subtler and more systemic than overt, explicitly discriminatory laws.

337,Can an adult human skull hypothetically pass through the birth canal?,"The size and shape of an adult human skull are significantly larger than the dimensions of the birth canal.  The process of childbirth relies on the flexibility of the fetal skull's bones and the ability of the baby's head to mold to fit through the passage. An adult skull lacks this flexibility and is far too large. Therefore, it is physically impossible for an adult human skull to pass through the birth canal.

338,Was King Kong (2005 film) the lead actress's biggest box office role?,"The 2005 film *King Kong* starred Naomi Watts as the lead actress.  To determine if this was her biggest box office role, we need to compare the box office gross of *King Kong* to the box office gross of her other films.  While a definitive answer requires a comprehensive list of all her films and their box office numbers, a quick search reveals that several of her films, such as *The Impossible* and *Mulholland Drive*, had comparable or even higher box office grosses than *King Kong*.

339,Were mollusks an ingredient in the color purple?,"The color purple, historically, was produced using a variety of ingredients, many of which are plant-based.  There's no record or evidence that mollusks were used in the production of purple dye.  The most famous source of purple dye, Tyrian purple, came from certain species of Murex snails, which are mollusks, but they were used to produce a specific shade of purple, and not all purples used mollusks.  Many other pigments and dyes were used to achieve different shades of purple, utilizing materials like plants and minerals.

"
344,Does frost mean that it will be a snowy day?,"Frost forms when the temperature of surfaces drops below freezing (0°C or 32°F), causing water vapor in the air to deposit as ice crystals.  While frost often indicates cold temperatures that *could* be conducive to snow, it doesn't guarantee snow.  Snow requires precipitation in the form of ice crystals, which is a different meteorological process than frost formation. You can have frost on the ground on a clear, cold day with no snow at all.

349,Is there a popular Disney character made from living ice?,"The Disney movie ""Frozen"" features Elsa, a princess with the power to create and manipulate ice.  While she is not *made* of ice, her powers are intrinsically linked to it, and she can transform into a being of ice and snow.  Therefore, while not literally made of living ice, Elsa is closely associated with it and could be considered a popular Disney character with a powerful connection to living ice.

Even if a stool were somehow large enough to support its weight, the dinosaur's size and anatomy would make it impossible to climb.

Answer: {false}
"
352,Would Bonanza marathon end before WWE Heat marathon?,"To determine whether a Bonanza marathon would end before a WWE Heat marathon, we need to compare the typical episode lengths and the number of episodes in a typical marathon.

* **Bonanza:**  Each episode of Bonanza is approximately 60 minutes long.  A marathon could consist of multiple episodes, possibly even dozens.

* **WWE Heat:**  WWE Heat episodes are typically 30 minutes long. A marathon would also consist of multiple episodes, potentially more episodes than a Bonanza marathon due to the shorter episode length.

While we don't know the exact number of episodes in each hypothetical marathon,  it's highly likely that a WWE Heat marathon, with its shorter episodes, would contain more episodes overall. Therefore, a WWE Heat marathon would likely last longer than a Bonanza marathon of similar duration (e.g., both running for six hours).

Answer: {false}
"
353,Does the cuisine of Hawaii embrace foods considered gross in the continental US?,"Hawaiian cuisine incorporates a variety of ingredients and dishes that might be considered unusual or unappealing by some in the continental US.  For example, poi (a paste made from taro root) has a unique, almost gluey texture that many find off-putting.  Similarly, some people are not accustomed to the strong flavors of certain fish, or the inclusion of raw fish in dishes like poke.  Furthermore, the use of luau (a type of taro leaf) in various dishes could be viewed as unusual by those unfamiliar with it.  While not necessarily ""gross,"" these elements of Hawaiian cuisine showcase unique ingredients and preparations that are distinct from common mainland tastes, highlighting a cultural difference.

354,Are Tom and Jerry featured in a ride at Disneyland?,"Explanation:
To determine if Tom and Jerry are featured in a ride at Disneyland, we need to consider the rides available at Disneyland and whether Tom and Jerry are associated with any of them.  A quick search of Disneyland's official website or a general knowledge of Disneyland rides would reveal whether a Tom and Jerry themed ride exists.  While there are many cartoon-themed rides and attractions at Disneyland, it's unlikely that one would be specifically dedicated to Tom and Jerry.

Answer: {true}
"
356,Is it legal for a licensed child driving Mercedes-Benz to be employed in US?,"The question asks whether it is legal for a licensed child driving a Mercedes-Benz to be employed in the US.  This involves several factors:

* **Driving Age:**  The minimum driving age varies by state in the US, but it's never below 16.  Even if a child has a driver's license, this does not automatically qualify them for employment.
* **Child Labor Laws:**  The US has strict child labor laws, with regulations varying by age and type of work.  These laws typically restrict the hours, types of jobs, and working conditions for minors.  Generally, minors are not permitted to engage in hazardous occupations.  Driving a Mercedes-Benz for work could be considered hazardous depending on the context (e.g., delivery driving).
* **Employment Laws:**  Beyond child labor laws, general employment laws apply.  A child would need to meet the minimum age requirements for the specific job.

Given that a child would need to be at least 16 to legally drive, and that child labor laws would heavily restrict employment of such a young person, particularly in roles involving driving (which could be considered hazardous), it's highly improbable that it would be legal for a licensed child driving a Mercedes-Benz to be employed in the US.

Answer: {false}
"
357,Would it be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition?,"The Iwato scale is a microtonal scale, meaning it uses intervals smaller than a semitone (the smallest interval in traditional Western music).  Twelve-tone technique, on the other hand, is a method of composing atonal music where all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are used equally within a composition. While the exact intervals of the Iwato scale might not align perfectly with the twelve-tone equal temperament system,  the principle of using all twelve notes is not inherently incompatible with the use of a microtonal scale.  A composer could theoretically conceive of a twelve-tone composition that uses the pitches of an Iwato scale.

358,Would Stephen King fans be likely to own an image of a clown?,"Stephen King is a horror author known for his use of clowns as terrifying figures in many of his works, most notably Pennywise the Dancing Clown in *It*.  Therefore, it's unlikely that Stephen King fans would actively seek out and own images of clowns, especially those that resemble Pennywise, due to the association with fear and horror. While some might own such images ironically or as a collector's item, it's not a likely scenario for the majority of fans.

"
363,Can 200 men end to end cover Great Pyramid of Giza's base?,"The Great Pyramid of Giza has a base of approximately 756 feet (230 meters).  To determine if 200 men, end to end, could cover this distance, we need to estimate the average length of a man.  Let's assume an average height of 5.5 feet (1.67 meters) for a man.  While standing end-to-end, we'd need to consider the distance from the back of one person's head to the back of the next, which might be around 5-6 feet. Let's use 5.75 feet as a reasonable estimation.

Therefore, 200 men at 5.75 feet each would cover 200 * 5.75 feet = 1150 feet.  Since 1150 feet is greater than 756 feet, 200 men standing end to end would be able to cover the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

364,Are tumors in the lymph nodes ignorable?,"Tumors in the lymph nodes are a serious medical concern and should never be ignored. Lymph nodes are part of the body's immune system, and the presence of a tumor there often indicates a problem, such as cancer (lymphoma or metastasis from another cancer). Ignoring a lymph node tumor can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, significantly impacting the chances of successful outcome.  Therefore, any lump or swelling in the lymph nodes requires prompt medical evaluation by a healthcare professional.

367,Would Jesus understand the Easter Bunny?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation: The Easter Bunny is a modern, secular tradition associated with springtime and the celebration of Easter,  a Christian holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  While the symbolism of new life and rebirth in springtime might resonate with some aspects of the Christian faith, the Easter Bunny itself is a folkloric figure that developed separately and long after Jesus's time.  Therefore, it is highly improbable that Jesus would understand the concept of the Easter Bunny.
"
368,Is the Fibonacci number sequence longer than every number discovered in Pi?,"The Fibonacci sequence is an infinitely long sequence of numbers.  Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.  It continues indefinitely: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

Pi (π), on the other hand, is an irrational number.  While trillions of digits of pi have been calculated, the decimal representation continues infinitely without repeating.  However, each digit of pi is a single number (0-9).  The Fibonacci sequence contains numbers of increasing magnitude.  We're comparing a sequence of infinitely increasing numbers with an infinitely long sequence of single digits.  No matter how many digits of pi are discovered, the Fibonacci sequence will always contain larger numbers.

Therefore, the Fibonacci number sequence, because it is an infinite sequence of ever-increasing numbers, is considered longer than any finite number of digits found in pi.

369,Is average number of peas in a pod enough commas for a billion?,"The question asks if the average number of peas in a pod, when expressed as a number, contains enough commas to represent a billion.  A billion is written as 1,000,000,000 and contains 8 commas.  The average number of peas in a pod is far less than a billion; even if we were to consider exceptionally large pods, the number of peas would still not reach 1 billion.  Therefore, the number of peas in the average pod would not contain 8 commas.

373,Will Ronda Rousey hypothetically defeat X-Men's Colossus in a fight?,"Answer: Ronda Rousey is a highly skilled mixed martial artist with a strong background in Judo.  Colossus, from the X-Men, possesses superhuman strength, durability, and size. While Rousey is exceptionally skilled in hand-to-hand combat, Colossus's superior strength and near invulnerability would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for her to defeat him.  His size alone would give him a massive advantage.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely Ronda Rousey could win a fight against Colossus.

Answer: {false}
"
374,Can DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?,"To determine if the DRL Racer X drone can cross the Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds, we need information about the drone's speed and the length of the Brooklyn Bridge.

The Brooklyn Bridge's main span is approximately 1,595.5 feet (486 meters) long.  However, the total distance a drone would need to travel to cross would likely be longer, considering the approach and exit ramps. Let's assume a total distance of approximately 2000 feet for this calculation.

We need the speed of the DRL Racer X drone.  Information on this is not readily available in public knowledge.  Professional racing drones are incredibly fast, potentially reaching speeds of over 100 mph (160 km/h),  but that speed depends on various factors (course, wind, etc.).

To cross 2000 feet in 18 seconds, the drone would need an average speed of (2000 feet / 18 seconds) ≈ 111 feet per second. This converts to approximately 75 mph (121 km/h).  This speed is plausible for a top-tier racing drone.  However, without knowing the exact speed capabilities of the DRL Racer X drone in real-world conditions (accounting for wind resistance, obstacles, etc.), we can't definitively say it could make the crossing in that time.

Answer: {False}
"
375,Can photography be considered abstract art?,"Photography, while often used to represent reality, can absolutely be considered abstract art.  Abstract art prioritizes form, color, and composition over representational accuracy.  Many photographers utilize techniques that deliberately obscure or distort recognizable subject matter, focusing instead on the interplay of light, shadow, texture, and color.  Blurring, unusual angles, selective focus, and manipulation of the photographic print itself can all transform a photograph from a documentary image to an exploration of abstract concepts and visual effects.  Therefore, the medium of photography is not inherently antithetical to abstract artistic expression.

Answer: {true}
"
376,Could a giant squid fit aboard the deck of the titanic?,"The Titanic's deck space needs to be considered.  While the exact dimensions of the various decks varied, we can assume a significant amount of open deck space existed.  A giant squid, while potentially reaching lengths of over 40 feet, is not particularly wide. The bulk of its body is relatively slender. Therefore, it's plausible that a giant squid, depending on its exact size and the arrangement of its tentacles, could possibly fit on the deck of the Titanic.  There would be challenges in containment and handling, of course, but physical fitting is a different matter.

387,Can a woman on average have a baby before wheat seed blooms?,"Human gestation is approximately 9 months.  Wheat typically blooms (meaning the flower appears) around 60-90 days after planting, depending on the variety and climate.  While the exact timing varies, a woman's average pregnancy is considerably longer than the wheat blooming period.  Therefore, it's highly likely a woman could have a baby *after* wheat seed blooms, if she were already pregnant before the blooming. It depends entirely on the timing of conception relative to the wheat planting and blooming. However, it's more likely the blooming would occur *before* the baby is born.

"
392,Is Eid al-Fitr holiday inappropriate to watch entire US Office?,"Eid al-Fitr is a significant religious holiday for Muslims, often involving prayer, family gatherings, and special meals.  Watching an entire season of ""The Office,"" a long sitcom, would likely require a considerable time commitment.  This could potentially detract from the focus on religious observance and family time associated with the holiday, making it inappropriate for some individuals. However, whether it is entirely ""inappropriate"" is subjective and depends on individual priorities and preferences.  Some might find it a perfectly acceptable way to relax after religious obligations, while others may prioritize different activities.

"
393,"Can you fit every resident of Auburn, New York, in Tropicana Field?","To determine if all residents of Auburn, New York can fit in Tropicana Field, we need to compare the population of Auburn to the seating capacity of Tropicana Field.

* **Population of Auburn, NY:** According to recent census data, the population of Auburn, NY is approximately 27,000 people.  This number can fluctuate slightly depending on the source and year.

* **Seating Capacity of Tropicana Field:** Tropicana Field, a multi-purpose stadium, has a seating capacity that varies depending on the event.  For baseball games, it is typically around 31,000.  However, this number also includes seats that may not be available for general seating.

Since the seating capacity of Tropicana Field (approximately 31,000) is larger than the population of Auburn, NY (approximately 27,000), it's theoretically possible to fit all residents of Auburn in Tropicana Field.  This assumes everyone is seated and does not consider space needed for passageways, concessions, and other non-seating areas.

395,Were there greater landslides than 1980 United States presidential election?,"The question asks whether there have been greater landslides than the 1980 US presidential election, where Ronald Reagan won 44 states to Jimmy Carter's 6.  To answer this, we need to define ""greater landslide"" and compare the 1980 election to other US presidential elections.  A landslide is typically defined by a large margin of victory in the Electoral College and/or popular vote.  While the 1980 election was a significant landslide, other elections have also featured substantial margins of victory. For instance, some consider the 1972 Nixon-McGovern election (Nixon winning 49 states) or the 1920 Harding-Cox election (Harding winning 38 states) to be even larger landslides, based on the number of states won.

397,Could Tom Cruise explain mental auditing?,"Tom Cruise, a prominent Scientologist, could potentially explain mental auditing from the perspective of Scientology.  Scientology's auditing is a core practice involving a trained auditor using an E-meter (a type of galvanometer) to help a person confront and resolve negative experiences and beliefs that are believed to hinder their spiritual progress.  However, it's crucial to note that mental auditing, as practiced in Scientology, is not recognized by mainstream psychology or psychiatry and is considered controversial by many.  Its effectiveness lacks scientific evidence and its practices have been subject to criticism.  Therefore, while Tom Cruise could explain the procedure from a Scientologist's point of view, it would not be a scientifically valid or universally accepted explanation.

"
400,Did Benito Mussolini wear bigger shoes than Hafþór Björnsson?,"To answer this question, we need to find information on the shoe size of both Benito Mussolini and Hafþór Björnsson.  Finding precise shoe sizes for historical figures can be challenging, and may not be reliably documented.  However, we can make a reasonable inference based on their known heights and builds.

Hafþór Björnsson is a very tall and large man, known for his strength and participation in strongman competitions.  His height and build strongly suggest he would wear a very large shoe size.

Benito Mussolini was of average height and build for his time.  While we lack precise shoe size information, it's highly unlikely he would have worn shoes as large as a man of Björnsson's size.

Therefore, it is highly probable that Hafþór Björnsson wore larger shoes than Benito Mussolini.

407,Do some religions look forward to armageddon?,"Some branches of Christianity believe in a literal Armageddon as described in the Book of Revelation, a final battle between good and evil preceding the end times.  Other Christian denominations interpret Armageddon metaphorically or don't focus on it.  Similarly, some interpretations of Jewish eschatology include a concept of a final judgment and messianic age, sometimes involving conflict.  Therefore, while not all religions, certain interpretations within some religions, most notably some strands of Christianity and Judaism, do anticipate an event akin to Armageddon.

409,Would a Yeti be likely to have prehensile limbs?,"Yetis, also known as Abominable Snowmen, are legendary creatures believed to inhabit the Himalayas.  While their existence is unproven, depictions consistently portray them as bipedal, ape-like creatures covered in thick fur.  Prehensile limbs are limbs capable of grasping, like a monkey's tail or an elephant's trunk.  While apes have prehensile hands, there is no indication in any Yeti depiction or lore that they would possess prehensile limbs beyond their hands and feet.  Their depiction emphasizes their upright posture and use of their hands for walking, rather than grasping objects in a manner that requires prehensile limbs beyond their hands.

410,Can the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change be held at the Javits Center?,"The Javits Center is a large convention center in New York City.  The UNFCCC is a large international conference, and past COPs (Conferences of the Parties) have been held in large venues capable of accommodating many participants and associated events.  While the Javits Center's size and location make it a plausible venue for a large international event, there's no guarantee it would be chosen. The choice of venue depends on many factors including availability, cost, and the overall logistical considerations.  Therefore, it's possible, but not definitively certain.  The question is phrased as ""Could it be held?"", which allows for the possibility.

411,Did Operation Barbarossa or Barbarossa's last expedition succeed?,"Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, ultimately failed.  While the initial stages saw significant German advances, the vastness of the Soviet territory, the resilience of the Red Army, and the harsh Russian winter ultimately prevented a decisive German victory. The German army was significantly weakened and unable to achieve its primary objectives, leading to the turning of the tide of the war and eventually its defeat.  Therefore, neither Operation Barbarossa nor any subsequent German expeditions on the Eastern Front can be considered successful in achieving their strategic goals.

415,Could Amazon afford The Mona Lisa?,"Here's an explanation to determine if Amazon could afford the Mona Lisa:

To answer this question, we need to consider the estimated value of the Mona Lisa and Amazon's net worth.  The Mona Lisa is priceless in the sense that it's not for sale, and its insured value is astronomical, but estimates of its market value (were it to be sold) run into the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.  Amazon's net worth is in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Therefore, Amazon's current net worth vastly exceeds any conceivable sale price of the Mona Lisa.

418,Did King of Portuguese people in 1515 have familial ties to the Tudors?,"To determine if the King of Portugal in 1515 had familial ties to the Tudors, we need to identify the Portuguese king and research his family lineage.  In 1515, King Manuel I was the ruler of Portugal.  The Tudor dynasty in England began with Henry VII in 1485.  Genealogical research would be needed to see if there were any known connections between Manuel I's family and the Tudor family.  While there may have been some distant connections through intermarriage among European royal families, a direct and close familial tie is not immediately apparent and would require further investigation beyond the scope of this response.

422,Was the father of social security system serving in the white house during the Panic of 1907?,"The Panic of 1907 occurred in 1907.  The Social Security Act, which established the Social Security system, was signed into law in 1935.  Therefore, the person who is considered the ""father"" of the Social Security system (generally considered to be President Franklin D. Roosevelt) could not have been serving in the White House during the Panic of 1907.

"
426,Would an Evander Holyfield 2020 boxing return set age record?,"Evander Holyfield's age in 2020 would be relevant to whether a boxing return would set an age record.  To determine this, we need to know Holyfield's birthdate and compare it to the ages of other boxers who have competed professionally at older ages.  Without that information, we can't definitively say if a 2020 return would be a record.  We need to research the ages of other boxers who have competed at comparable levels in recent history.

428,Is sternum connected to any of the bones mentioned in James Weldon Johnson's Dem Bones?,"James Weldon Johnson's ""Dem Bones"" mentions the following bones: toe bone, ankle bone, leg bone, knee bone, thigh bone, hip bone, back bone, shoulder bone, neck bone, head bone.  The sternum (breastbone) is not directly connected to any of these bones in the way the song implies.  While the sternum is part of the rib cage and indirectly connected to the back bone via the ribs, it's not a direct articulation as described in the song's simple, childlike structure.  The song focuses on the skeletal structure's linear connections.

430,Does Buddy The Elf know anyone who works in publishing?,"The movie ""Elf"" depicts Buddy the Elf's journey to New York City to find his father.  While he doesn't explicitly know anyone *working* in publishing, his father, Walter Hobbs, is a high-powered executive at a publishing company.  Therefore, while Buddy doesn't have a pre-existing relationship with a publishing employee, he does find his biological father, who works in that industry.

"
432,Would 7 zucchini's satisfy potassium USDA daily recommendation?,"The USDA recommends 4,700 milligrams of potassium per day for adults.  One medium zucchini contains approximately 249 milligrams of potassium.  Seven zucchini would contain approximately 7 * 249 = 1743 milligrams of potassium.  This is significantly less than the recommended daily allowance.

Answer: {false}
"
433,Could Oprah Winfrey buy dozens of her staff Bugatti luxury cars?,"Oprah Winfrey is a very wealthy individual.  Bugatti luxury cars are extremely expensive, costing millions of dollars each.  While it's highly unlikely she could afford *dozens* of them without impacting her net worth significantly,  her immense wealth makes it *plausibly* possible that she could purchase that many vehicles if she chose to.  The phrasing ""could"" leaves room for possibility, not absolute certainty.

"
435,Do people still see Henry Ford's last name often?,"Henry Ford's last name is still very recognizable due to the enduring legacy of the Ford Motor Company.  The Ford brand remains a major player in the automotive industry, and his name is frequently associated with automobiles, manufacturing innovations, and even historical discussions of industrialization and labor practices.  While perhaps not as ubiquitously seen as some other surnames,  the name ""Ford"" remains firmly within the public consciousness.

436,Is the Liberty Bell still in its original location?,"The Liberty Bell is currently located in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  However, this is not its original location.  While it was originally housed in the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall), it has been moved several times throughout its history for various reasons, including preservation and display.  Therefore, it is no longer in its original location.

437,Would a viewer of Monday Night Football be able to catch WWE Raw during commercial breaks?,"Monday Night Football and WWE Raw air on different networks and at different times.  Monday Night Football typically airs from 8:15 PM to 11:15 PM Eastern Time (or later, depending on game length), while WWE Raw airs from 8 PM to 10 PM Eastern Time.  Even if a Monday Night Football viewer were to attempt to switch to WWE Raw during commercial breaks, the timing wouldn't allow it.  The short commercial breaks in Monday Night Football are unlikely to provide enough time to switch channels, find WWE Raw, and watch a significant portion of the show.

Answer: {false}
"
438,Were the first missionaries required to attend mass on Sundays?,"The question asks if the first missionaries were required to attend mass on Sundays.  To answer this, we need to consider the historical context of early missionaries and their religious practices.  While the expectation of Sunday Mass is a central tenet of Catholicism, the specific requirements and practices of early missionaries could have varied depending on their religious order, the geographic location of their mission, and the time period.  There was not a universal, standardized requirement. Early missionaries often operated in remote locations with limited access to established churches or other missionaries.  They might have had flexible practices dictated by their mission's necessities and the availability of others to celebrate Mass with.  It's therefore unlikely that attendance at a Sunday Mass was a universally mandated requirement for all early missionaries.

440,Is the use of the word Gypsy by non-Romani people considered okay?,"The term ""Gypsy"" is considered a slur by the Romani people.  It has a long history of being used to marginalize and stereotype them, often associated with negative connotations and harmful stereotypes.  While some may use the term without malicious intent, its historical baggage and the offense it causes within the Romani community make its use by non-Romani people unacceptable.  Respectful and accurate terminology should always be prioritized.  Therefore, using the term ""Gypsy"" by non-Romani people is not okay.

Answer: {false}
"
441,Did Robert Downey Jr. possess same caliber gun as Resident Evil's Barry Burton?,"To answer this question, we need to determine the type of firearm used by both Robert Downey Jr. in a relevant role and Barry Burton in Resident Evil.  There's no single definitive answer as both characters have used various firearms across their respective franchises.  We need to specify a particular film/game for each.  Without this specification, we cannot definitively say if they possessed the ""same caliber"" gun.  Even if we specified a film and game, the caliber might be the same, but the specific model and manufacturer may differ considerably, making the ""same caliber"" statement rather loose.

Answer: {false}
"
442,Did anyone in the 1912 election take a majority of the popular vote?,"The 1912 presidential election involved four major candidates: Woodrow Wilson (Democrat), Theodore Roosevelt (Progressive), William Howard Taft (Republican), and Eugene V. Debs (Socialist).  Because the vote was split among multiple strong candidates, no single candidate achieved a majority of the popular vote.  While Woodrow Wilson won the election, his popular vote share was less than 50%.

Answer: {false}
"
443,Can dessert be made with vegetables?,"Many desserts incorporate vegetables as ingredients, often in ways that mask their vegetable origin.  For example, carrot cake uses carrots, pumpkin pie uses pumpkin, and zucchini bread uses zucchini.  These vegetables add moisture, sweetness, and sometimes texture to the dessert, without necessarily tasting strongly of vegetables.  Therefore, it is definitively possible to make desserts with vegetables.

Answer: {true}
"
444,Do depressed people travel to the Golden Gate Bridge often?,"The Golden Gate Bridge is a well-known location for suicides.  While not all people who travel to the Golden Gate Bridge are depressed, or are going there with suicidal intent, there is a correlation between depression and the bridge due to its association with suicide attempts and completions.  Therefore, it's plausible that depressed people travel to the Golden Gate Bridge more often than the general population.  However, this is not a definitive statement; it's a correlation, not causation.  The question asks about frequency, and while there's no concrete data to provide an exact number for comparison, the correlation makes the statement likely true.

Answer: {true}
"
445,Is the letter D influenced by the shape of ancient doors?,"The letter D's shape is generally considered to derive from the ancient Greek letter Delta (Δ).  While the shape of Delta might bear some resemblance to a door, this is largely coincidental and not a direct influence. The evolution of letterforms often involves gradual changes and adaptations over time, and a direct link between the shape of letter D and ancient doors lacks substantial evidence.  There are various theories about the origin of the letter D, but a connection to ancient door shapes is not a widely accepted or supported one.


Answer: {false}
"
446,Did Methuselah live at least 800 years as long as Sarah?,"The question asks if Methuselah lived at least 800 years longer than Sarah.  We need to find out how long each person lived according to the Bible.

According to the Bible, Methuselah lived 969 years.  Sarah, Abraham's wife, lived to be 127 years old.

To determine if Methuselah lived at least 800 years longer than Sarah, we subtract Sarah's age from Methuselah's age: 969 - 127 = 842 years.

Since 842 is greater than 800, Methuselah did indeed live at least 800 years longer than Sarah.

Answer: {true}
"
447,Would a triples tandem bike support Apollo 15 crew?,"A triples tandem bike is a bicycle built for three people, with two people pedaling in the front and one in the back.  The Apollo 15 crew consisted of three astronauts: David Scott, Alfred Worden, and James Irwin.  While a triples tandem bike could physically *carry* the three astronauts, it's highly unlikely it could *support* their combined weight.  Triples tandem bikes are not designed for the weight of three adult men, especially not the added weight of spacesuits.  Furthermore, the bike's structural integrity would likely be compromised under that load.

Answer: {false}
"
448,Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?,"Answer: Dogs are domesticated animals and have been trained to respond to various stimuli, including bells, through classical conditioning. Grey seals are wild animals and are not typically trained to respond to bells. Therefore, a dog is more likely to respond to a bell than a grey seal.

451,Is Nicole Kidman ideal choice to play Psylocke based on height and weight?,"Psylocke, a Marvel Comics character, is depicted as being tall and slender.  While precise measurements aren't consistently given across different comic book iterations, she's generally portrayed as significantly taller than average.  Nicole Kidman is known for her statuesque presence, but whether her height and weight align perfectly with the various depictions of Psylocke is debatable.  While she might fit the ""tall and slender"" description in comparison to the average person, her exact dimensions might not precisely match all interpretations of the character's physique in the comics.

Answer: {false}
"
452,Would a bodybuilder enjoy wearing a cast for several weeks?,"Answer: Bodybuilders rely on consistent training and physical activity to maintain muscle mass and strength.  A cast immobilizes a limb, preventing any exercise or movement of that body part. This enforced inactivity would lead to muscle atrophy (loss of muscle mass and strength) in the affected limb, which is highly undesirable for a bodybuilder.  Therefore, a bodybuilder would likely find wearing a cast for several weeks to be extremely frustrating and detrimental to their training goals.

Answer: {false}

454,Does Adobe Suite have video game engine coding?,"Adobe Suite is a collection of software applications for graphic design, video editing, web development, and more.  While it includes powerful tools for animation and visual effects, it does not contain a full-fledged game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine.  Adobe After Effects can be used to create visual elements *for* video games, but it doesn't provide the framework for building a game's core mechanics, physics, and interactions.

Answer: {false}
"
455,Would 1943-S penny be good for making silverware?,"The 1943-S penny is a collectible coin made of steel, not copper.  Silverware is typically made from silver or other metals like stainless steel, which is an alloy. While the 1943-S penny is made of steel, it's unlikely to be of sufficient quantity or quality to be practical or worthwhile for making silverware. The amount of steel in a single penny is tiny, and the process of melting down and reforming it would be far more expensive and time-consuming than simply buying silverware.

Answer: {false}
"
456,Is Lord Voldemort associated with a staff member of Durmstrang?,"The question asks if Lord Voldemort is associated with a staff member of Durmstrang.  Durmstrang Institute is a wizarding school in the Harry Potter universe.  Igor Karkaroff was the headmaster of Durmstrang during the events of *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*.  Karkaroff was a former Death Eater, meaning he served under Lord Voldemort. While not explicitly stated as a direct employment relationship post-his time as headmaster, Karkaroff's prior allegiance and association with Voldemort would constitute an association between Voldemort and a Durmstrang staff member (Karkaroff).

Answer: {true}
"
457,Does a person need a college degree to become a bartender?,"Answer:  No, a college degree is not a requirement for becoming a bartender.

Many bartending schools offer shorter programs as well.

Answer: {false}
"
458,Could you make the kitchen 'holy trinity' without celery?,"The classic ""holy trinity"" of mirepoix in French cooking consists of onions, carrots, and celery.  Omitting celery would still leave a flavorful base, but it would change the character of the resulting dish. The sweetness of the carrots would be more prominent without the celery's slightly bitter counterpoint.  Therefore, you *can* make a base similar to the holy trinity without celery, but it wouldn't be the *true* holy trinity.

Answer: {true}
"
459,Do white blood cells outnumber red blood cells in the human body?,"The number of red blood cells in the human body significantly outweighs the number of white blood cells.  A typical adult has around 5 million red blood cells per microliter of blood, while white blood cells number only around 7,000 per microliter.  This difference represents a ratio of approximately 700:1 red blood cells to white blood cells.

460,Can you swim to Miami from New York?,"The distance between New York City and Miami is approximately 1,500 miles.  Swimming that distance is impossible for a human being.  The open ocean presents numerous challenges, including strong currents, exhaustion, dehydration, exposure to the elements, and the risk of encountering dangerous marine life.  Even the most experienced and physically fit swimmers could not survive such a long and arduous journey.

Answer: {false}
"
461,Gandalf hypothetically defeats Rincewind in a wizard battle?,"Explanation:
The question asks whether Gandalf could hypothetically defeat Rincewind in a wizard battle.  Gandalf is a powerful and skilled wizard from the Lord of the Rings universe, known for his strength, wisdom, and magical abilities.  Rincewind, from the Discworld series, is a famously incompetent wizard who relies on luck and accidental magic rather than skill or power.  While Rincewind possesses a certain amount of cunning and can occasionally stumble into success, a direct confrontation with Gandalf would almost certainly result in Gandalf's victory.  Gandalf's superior magical power and combat experience would overwhelmingly outweigh Rincewind's unpredictable, and ultimately unreliable, abilities.

Answer: {true}
"
462,Was a Tiny House ceiling out of Osama bin Laden's reach?,"The question asks whether Osama bin Laden could reach a tiny house ceiling.  To answer this, we need to consider the typical height of a tiny house ceiling and the likely height of Osama bin Laden.

Tiny houses typically have lower ceilings than standard houses, often ranging from 7 to 9 feet.  Osama bin Laden's height is reported to have been around 6 feet 4 inches (approximately 1.93 meters or 76 inches).

While 7 feet is a relatively low ceiling, a person of Osama bin Laden's height could likely reach it, especially if they were standing on something. However, there are various tiny house designs, some having even lower ceilings than 7 feet, while others have lofted ceilings that would definitely be out of his reach. The question does not specify the exact dimensions of the ""tiny house"" in question.


Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether a tiny house ceiling would be out of his reach without more information.


Answer: {false}
"
463,Did England win any Olympic gold medals in 1800?,"The modern Olympic Games, as we know them, began in 1896.  There were no Olympic Games held in 1800. Therefore, England (or any other nation) could not have won any gold medals that year.

Answer: {false}
"
464,Is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Atari Landfill story an urban legend?,"The story of millions of unsold E.T. Atari cartridges being buried in a landfill in New Mexico is widely circulated.  While there's evidence that Atari did dispose of a significant amount of unsold inventory, the scale of the event—millions of cartridges—and the precise details of the burial are often exaggerated. The story has become embellished over time, leading many to believe it's an urban legend, despite a grain of truth at its core.  The actual number of cartridges buried is likely far less than the commonly cited figures. Therefore, while a disposal of Atari games did occur, the legendary scale of the event makes it debatable whether it remains a factual event or largely an urban legend.

467,Is Hermione Granger eligible for the Order of the British Empire?,"Answer: Hermione Granger is a fictional character in the Harry Potter series.  The Order of the British Empire (OBE) is a real award given to real people for contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organisations, and public service outside the civil service.  Since Hermione Granger is not a real person, she is ineligible for the Order of the British Empire.

468,Are all types of pottery safe to cook in?,"No, not all types of pottery are safe for cooking.  Some pottery, especially older or handmade pieces, may contain lead or cadmium glazes that can leach into food during cooking, causing health problems.

Answer: {false}
"
469,Was Pope Alexander VI's origin country least represented in papal history?,"Pope Alexander VI, whose birth name was Rodrigo Borgia, was born in Valencia, Spain.  While Spain has had numerous popes, determining whether Spain is the *least* represented country requires a comprehensive count of papal origins across all of history.  This is a complex task involving researching each pope's birthplace and potentially facing ambiguities about specific regions in the past.  Without access to a complete and verified database of all papal origins, a definitive answer is impossible.


Answer: {false}
"
470,Can depression be mistaken for laziness?,"Depression can manifest in various ways, including lethargy, lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms can easily be misinterpreted as laziness or a lack of willpower.  However, depression is a complex mental health condition with underlying biological and psychological factors, whereas laziness is a behavioral choice.  While the outward behaviors may appear similar, the underlying causes are fundamentally different.  Someone experiencing depression is often struggling internally to perform even basic tasks, while someone described as lazy is making a conscious choice not to exert themselves.  The crucial distinction lies in understanding the root cause of the behavior.

Answer: {true}
"
471,Is Oculudentavis more dangerous than Allosaurus?,"Oculudentavis is an extinct bird-like dinosaur known from a single, exceptionally well-preserved fossil.  Allosaurus, on the other hand, was a large, predatory theropod dinosaur.  While the fossil evidence for Oculudentavis suggests it was a small creature, Allosaurus was a significantly larger and more powerful predator.  Based on size and predatory capabilities, Allosaurus would be considered far more dangerous than Oculudentavis.

473,Are Big Ben's bells currently rung on their normal schedule at the Palace of Westminster?,"Big Ben, the Great Bell of the Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster, has undergone extensive renovations since 2017.  These renovations included significant work on the clock mechanism and the bell itself.  During this period, the bells were not rung on their normal schedule. While some restoration work has concluded, it's uncertain whether the bells have fully resumed their normal schedule.  Therefore, it's unlikely that they are currently rung on their normal schedule.

"
476,"Is Olympia, Washington part of ""Ish river country""?","The question asks if Olympia, Washington is part of ""Ish river country.""  To answer this, we need to determine what ""Ish river country"" refers to and whether Olympia is located within that region.  There's no widely recognized geographical area officially called ""Ish river country.""  It's likely a colloquial or informal term.  A search for geographical locations using similar names doesn't provide a definitive answer connecting it to Olympia.  Therefore, without additional context or clarification on the meaning of ""Ish river country,"" it's impossible to definitively say whether Olympia is part of it.

Answer: {false}
"
477,Do silicone suits make judo difficult?,"Silicone suits, due to their slick and non-grippy surface, would significantly hinder the ability to execute proper grips and throws in judo.

"
481,Would an anxious person benefit from receiving courage from the Wizard of Oz?,"The Wizard of Oz is a fictional character who is presented as possessing magical powers, but these are ultimately revealed to be illusions.  While the Wizard might *offer* courage, he doesn't actually possess the ability to bestow it.  An anxious person needs real-world coping mechanisms and potentially professional help to address their anxiety, not fictional magic. Therefore, receiving ""courage"" from the Wizard of Oz would not provide any tangible benefit to an anxious person.

Answer: {false}
"
482,Can a firewall protect against a short circuit?,"A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.  It's designed to protect against cyber threats such as malware, hacking attempts, and unauthorized access.  A short circuit, on the other hand, is a fault in an electrical circuit that allows current to flow unexpectedly through a low-resistance path, often causing overheating and potential damage.  These are entirely different domains:  firewalls deal with digital data, while short circuits are a physical electrical phenomenon. A firewall cannot prevent or mitigate a short circuit.

485,Is Kim Kardashian a guru?,"Kim Kardashian is a highly visible media personality known for her involvement in reality television, business ventures, and social media presence.  While she has amassed a large following and significant influence, the term ""guru"" typically implies expertise and authority in a specific field, often spiritual, philosophical, or professional.  Kim Kardashian's public image doesn't directly align with a traditional understanding of a guru's role or expertise.  While she might be considered an influencer in fashion, beauty, or business,  applying the label ""guru"" would be subjective and depend heavily on individual interpretation.

492,Did villain that killed Superman murder Robin?,"The question asks if the villain who killed Superman also murdered Robin.  This requires knowledge of Superman's and Robin's respective storylines in DC Comics.  While various villains have killed Superman over the years (e.g., Doomsday, Lex Luthor), and various villains have killed Robin (e.g., the Joker), there is no single villain who is canonically responsible for killing both Superman and Robin.  Different villains were responsible in different iterations of the stories. Therefore, the answer is false.

493,Would someone typically confuse a sweet potato with a pineapple?,"Sweet potatoes and pineapples are distinct fruits/vegetables with vastly different appearances, tastes, and textures.  Sweet potatoes are root vegetables with a starchy, earthy flavor and brown/orange flesh. Pineapples are tropical fruits with a spiky exterior, juicy yellow flesh, and a tangy-sweet flavor. There is no reason to expect someone to typically confuse the two.

"
494,Is overfeeding Lactobacillus unwise for people without dental insurance?,"Explanation:
Lactobacillus is a genus of bacteria found in yogurt and other fermented foods.  While generally beneficial for gut health, excessive consumption of foods high in Lactobacillus can contribute to tooth decay. This is because Lactobacillus ferments sugars, producing lactic acid, which can erode tooth enamel.  People without dental insurance may be less likely to seek preventative or restorative dental care, making them more vulnerable to the negative effects of excessive lactic acid production. Therefore, overfeeding on Lactobacillus might be unwise for those without dental insurance due to the increased risk of dental problems.

497,Can an Arvanite Greek understand some of the Albanian Declaration of Independence?,"Arvanites are a Greek-speaking population in Greece whose ancestors migrated from Albania centuries ago.  While their primary language is Greek, their history and potential contact with Albanian speakers over time might mean some degree of understanding of Albanian, particularly if they have had exposure to it.  However, there's no guarantee of significant comprehension. The Albanian Declaration of Independence is written in Albanian. While some vocabulary might overlap due to linguistic proximity and shared history, the grammatical structures and many vocabulary items will differ enough to prevent fluent understanding without prior knowledge of Albanian.  Therefore, it is unlikely an Arvanite Greek would understand a substantial portion of the Declaration without some level of Albanian language study.

Its themes of love, tragedy, family conflict, and fate are universally relevant and easily accessible to high school students. While some may find the language challenging, the story itself is engaging and frequently adapted into various media, making it a familiar narrative.  Therefore, it's not unusual at all to teach it in high school.

500,Would Jon Brower Minnoch break a chair before Voyager 2 launch mass?,"Jon Brower Minnoch's highest recorded weight was 1400 pounds.  Voyager 2's launch mass was approximately 1,835 kg, which is about 4046 pounds.  Since 1400 pounds is less than 4046 pounds, Minnoch's weight is less than Voyager 2's launch mass.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely he could break a chair strong enough to support Voyager 2's weight, as his weight would be significantly less.

506,Would Hannah Nixon be proud of Richard Nixon following the Watergate scandal?,"Explanation:
The Watergate scandal involved President Richard Nixon's administration attempting to cover up a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters.  This led to Nixon's resignation and a significant erosion of public trust in the presidency.  Given the severity of the scandal and its impact on the nation, it's highly unlikely that Hannah Nixon, his mother, would have been proud of his actions during this period.  While familial love might have persisted, the scandal's implications would likely have caused profound disappointment and shame.

509,Is Christopher Nolan indebted to Bob Kane?,"Christopher Nolan is a film director known for directing movies like Inception, The Dark Knight trilogy, and Dunkirk.  Bob Kane is the creator of Batman.  While Christopher Nolan directed Batman films, he did not create the character or the original stories.  He adapted pre-existing material for his films. Therefore, while he is using pre-existing intellectual property, he does not owe a debt in the traditional sense to Bob Kane.  He likely obtained the rights to use the Batman character and its associated stories through a licensing agreement with the copyright holders.

Answer: {false}
"
510,Was Morris County named after a chief justice?,"Morris County, New Jersey, is named after Lewis Morris, a colonial governor of New Jersey. While he was not a chief justice, he held other significant positions of power, including serving as a judge on the New Jersey Supreme Court.  Therefore, while not precisely a ""chief justice,"" he was a prominent jurist whose name the county bears.

Answer: {true}
"
511,Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?,"The question asks whether Japanese serfdom held a higher social status than its English counterpart.  Both systems involved individuals bound to the land and obligated to perform labor for a lord, but their social standing differed significantly.  English serfdom, while restrictive, existed within a more clearly defined feudal hierarchy with a complex system of rights and obligations.  While serfs were at the bottom, they still possessed certain legal protections and rights, even if limited.  Japanese serfdom, particularly during certain periods, often involved a less defined social structure and could encompass a wider range of conditions, with some serfs experiencing considerably harsher treatment and lower social standing than others.  The comparison isn't straightforward because the terms ""serf"" and the specifics of serfdom varied considerably between cultures and time periods.  However, a generalized comparison suggests that, on average, English serfs likely enjoyed a relatively higher social standing than their Japanese counterparts in many periods of Japanese history, due to the greater level of legal protection and defined social structure in England.

"
512,Would a cauliflower farmer prosper at a latitude of 75° N?,"Cauliflower requires a relatively long growing season with consistently cool temperatures and sufficient sunlight.  Latitude 75° N is located within the Arctic Circle, characterized by extremely short growing seasons, very long periods of darkness during winter, and persistent cold temperatures even during summer.  The conditions at this latitude are far too harsh for the successful cultivation of cauliflower.  Therefore, a cauliflower farmer would not prosper at this location.

513,"In a hypothetical race between a Swallow and an American Woodcock, would the Swallow win?","Swallows are known for their fast, agile flight, often reaching speeds of over 20 mph in short bursts.  American Woodcocks, while capable of flight, are much slower and are more adapted to low-altitude, erratic flight patterns for foraging.  Therefore, in a straight race, the swallow would almost certainly win.

Answer: {true}
"
514,Would a cattle farmer be useful to a drum maker?,"A cattle farmer could provide the drum maker with animal hide, which is a traditional material used for drumheads.  The hide would need to be processed, but it's a key component of drum construction.

516,"In baseball, is a ""Homer"" named after the poet Homer who wrote the Odyssey?","The term ""homer"" in baseball refers to a home run, a hit that allows the batter to circle all the bases and score a run.  There's no etymological connection between the baseball term ""homer"" and the Greek poet Homer.  The origin of the baseball term is unrelated to the poet.

Answer: {false}
"
517,Have any murderers outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record?,"Kane's record in the Royal Rumble is lasting 45 minutes and 25 seconds.  To determine if any murderers have outlasted this record, we need to look at the time spent evading capture and/or being at large before apprehension after committing murder.  This information is not readily available in a way that would allow for a direct comparison to a wrestling match timeframe.  While some murderers may have remained at large for extended periods, we can't definitively say if any have exceeded 45 minutes and 25 seconds due to the inherent difficulty in tracking the exact time frame from the commission of the crime to apprehension.  Moreover, the ""outlasting"" metaphor is inappropriate to apply to a serious crime.

Answer: {false}
"
518,Can you watch Rick and Morty in Mariana Trench?,"The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the ocean, with crushing pressure and total darkness.  There is no infrastructure or technology present there that would allow for watching Rick and Morty.

520,Would a clouded leopard encounter an awake pangolin?,"Clouded leopards are nocturnal and arboreal predators. Pangolins are nocturnal and primarily terrestrial, although they can climb trees.  While their habitats may overlap, and there is potential for an encounter, it's not guaranteed that a clouded leopard would encounter an *awake* pangolin.  Pangolins are highly effective at protecting themselves with their armor, and they often sleep curled up in a ball.  A clouded leopard might find it difficult to catch and kill an awake pangolin.

Answer: {false}
"
521,Is the name of a mythical creature also the name of a Small Solar System body?,"The question asks if a mythical creature's name is also the name of a small Solar System body.  Many mythical creatures exist across various cultures, and numerous small Solar System bodies have been discovered and named.  To answer this definitively requires knowing the specific mythical creature considered.  However, if we consider a broad range of mythical creatures and the naming conventions used for Solar System bodies (often drawing from mythology), it is plausible that there is overlap. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is responsible for naming celestial bodies, and they often draw inspiration from mythology and literature.  Therefore, it is quite likely that a name used for a mythical creature is also used for a small Solar System body.

Answer: {true}
"
522,Does  Lionel Richie believe in holistic medicine?,"There is no publicly available information stating Lionel Richie's beliefs regarding holistic medicine.  While he may have expressed opinions on health and wellness in interviews or social media, there's nothing readily accessible to confirm whether he specifically believes in holistic medicine.  Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question.

524,Do salmon mate in the Caspian Sea?,"Salmon are anadromous fish, meaning they are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to mature, and then return to freshwater to spawn.  The Caspian Sea is a saltwater inland sea. While some salmon species might tolerate brackish water for short periods, they generally require freshwater rivers for spawning.  Therefore, it's unlikely that salmon would mate in the Caspian Sea itself.

Answer: {false}

"
526,Could eating Chinook salmon help Ryan Reynolds?,"Ryan Reynolds is known for his roles in action movies and comedic performances.  Chinook salmon is a nutrient-rich food, high in Omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and vitamin D. These nutrients can contribute to overall health, including heart health, brain function, and potentially even skin health, all of which could be beneficial to someone with a physically demanding job like an actor.  While there's no specific connection between eating Chinook salmon and Ryan Reynolds' career or health status, the nutritional benefits of the fish could generally improve his well-being.

529,Were muskets used in the Pacific War?,"The Pacific War, also known as the Pacific Theater of World War II, primarily involved fighting between 1941 and 1945. While muskets were obsolete firearms by this point, having been largely replaced by more modern weaponry like rifles, machine guns, and artillery,  it's highly unlikely that muskets saw significant or organized use by any major combatant in the Pacific War.  While there might have been extremely rare instances of their use by isolated, poorly equipped militias or in a ceremonial context, their role would have been negligible in the overall conflict.

Answer: {false}
"
530,Was Noah associated with a dove?,"The biblical story of Noah's Ark features a dove that Noah sends out from the Ark to search for land.  The dove returns with an olive branch, signifying that dry land was near. This is a well-known part of the Noah's Ark narrative.

"
531,Is Britney Spears' breakdown attributed to bipolar disorder?,"Britney Spears' highly publicized mental health struggles in 2007 involved a period of erratic behavior and public breakdowns. While various factors contributed to her situation, including immense pressure from fame and personal difficulties,  there's no definitive diagnosis of bipolar disorder publicly attributed to her by her doctors or representatives.  Media reports speculated on various diagnoses at the time, but these were largely unsubstantiated.  Therefore, directly attributing her breakdown solely to bipolar disorder is inaccurate.

Answer: {false}
"
532,Is a Cassowary safer pet than a crane?,"Cassowaries are large, flightless birds known for their aggressive nature and powerful legs equipped with sharp claws.  They are considered one of the most dangerous birds in the world.  Cranes, while large birds, are generally less aggressive and less likely to attack humans.  Therefore, a crane would be a safer pet than a cassowary.

Answer: {false}
"
533,Was Mark Twain a struggling inventor?,"Mark Twain, while known for his writing, is not widely known for being an inventor. While he did hold patents for some inventions (like a self-pasting scrapbook and an improved typesetting machine), he wasn't primarily an inventor, and his inventions did not achieve widespread success or make him wealthy.  His primary profession and claim to fame was as an author. Therefore, describing him as a ""struggling inventor"" is inaccurate. He struggled financially at times, but this was primarily related to his writing career, not his invention efforts.

Answer: {false}
"
534,Was the Eiffel tower used as a symbol of the French Revolution?,"The French Revolution took place between 1789 and 1799.  The Eiffel Tower was not constructed until 1889. Therefore, it could not have been used as a symbol of the French Revolution.

"
535,Is the Berlin University of the Arts a Baroque period relic?,"The Berlin University of the Arts (Universität der Künste Berlin) was founded in 1696 as an academy of art. However, the Baroque period generally ended around the early 18th century.  While the university's origins lie within the Baroque era, its current form and most of its buildings are far more recent, and are not characteristic of Baroque architecture.  The university has been significantly reshaped and expanded over centuries.  Therefore, calling it a ""Baroque period relic"" is inaccurate.

There is no overlap in names.

Answer: {false}
"
538,Would Cuba Libre consumption help with insomnia?,"Cuba Libre is a cocktail made with rum, lime juice, and cola.  Rum contains alcohol, which is a known depressant. While some people might find that a small amount of alcohol helps them relax and fall asleep, it's more likely to disrupt sleep, particularly in larger quantities.  The sugar content of cola will also likely lead to energy spikes and crashes, further interfering with sleep. Therefore, consuming Cuba Libres is unlikely to help with insomnia and could worsen it.

Answer: {false}
"
539,Is Glycol something United Airlines would buy?,"Glycol, specifically ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, are commonly used as aircraft de-icing fluids.  United Airlines, as a major airline, would require large quantities of de-icing fluids for their operations, particularly in colder climates.  Therefore, it's highly likely they would purchase glycol.

Therefore, both the lead character in Nobunaga's Ambition and the main character in Rurouni Kenshin are from the same country.

Answer: {true}
"
548,Can Darth Vader hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton without using The Force?,"Explanation:

To determine if Darth Vader could hypothetically outdunk Bill Walton without using the Force, we need to consider their physical attributes.  Bill Walton, though tall, is known more for his finesse and skill than his incredible leaping ability.  Darth Vader, in his suit, is significantly less agile and mobile than a typical human athlete.  His suit's bulk would severely hamper his jumping ability. While he is tall, his mobility and weight would likely prevent him from outjumping Walton.  Therefore, it's unlikely he could outdunk Walton without using the Force, which is explicitly excluded from this scenario.

Answer: {false}
"
549,Is popular science used to peer review papers?,"Popular science publications are aimed at a general audience and do not typically engage in the rigorous peer-review process used for academic journals. Peer review involves expert evaluation of research before publication, a process that is central to maintaining the quality and credibility of scientific literature. Popular science articles, while often based on scientific findings, are primarily focused on accessibility and engaging storytelling, rather than the detailed scrutiny required for scientific peer review.  Therefore, popular science is not used to peer review papers.

However, it's unclear whether any of them have starred in a Broadway production.  There are Broadway shows based on Disney films, but not necessarily featuring *all* the princesses.  Therefore, without knowing definitively which Disney princess is being referred to, or which Broadway show, the statement cannot be definitively proven true or false.

"
552,Could all of the 2008 Summer Olympics women find a hookup athlete partner?,"The 2008 Summer Olympics had approximately 5,700 female athletes participating.  To determine if they could all find a hookup athlete partner, we'd need to know the number of male athletes.  However, assuming a roughly equal number of male and female athletes (a simplification, as the exact numbers aren't readily available), it's plausible that all female athletes could find a male athlete partner.

Even with an unequal number, the sheer number of athletes makes it highly probable that the vast majority, if not all, could find a partner.  It's not guaranteed for every single athlete, but statistically, it's very likely.

Answer: {true}
"
553,Did Eiffel Tower contribute to a war victory?,"The Eiffel Tower's construction was completed in 1889, and while it was a symbol of French ingenuity and national pride, it did not directly contribute to a specific war victory.

555,Does Lemon enhance the flavor of milk?,"Lemon's tartness and acidity contrast sharply with the sweetness and creaminess of milk.  While some might find the combination appealing, many would consider it unpleasant.  The citrus flavor tends to overpower the delicate taste of milk, creating a sour and potentially unpalatable drink.  Therefore, it's unlikely that most people would find lemon enhances the flavor of milk.

561,Is Godzilla's image likely grounds for a lawsuit in 2050?,"Godzilla's image is protected by copyright, and that copyright will likely still be in effect in 2050, depending on the specific copyright terms and any renewals.  While copyright protection generally lasts for a significant period after the creator's death, it's possible that the copyright could have expired or been transferred by then. If the copyright is still in effect, unauthorized use of Godzilla's image would indeed be grounds for a lawsuit. However,  if it has expired and fallen into the public domain, it would not be.  Given the enduring popularity of Godzilla, it is likely that Toho (the company that owns the rights) would have taken steps to renew or protect the copyright.

Answer: {true}

"
563,Is cow methane safer for environment than cars?,"Cow methane is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing significantly to climate change.  While cars also emit greenhouse gases, the composition and impact differ.  Methane traps heat far more effectively than carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary greenhouse gas from cars.  However, the sheer volume of CO2 emissions from cars globally far outweighs the methane emissions from cows, even considering methane's higher warming potential.  Therefore, while cow methane is a serious environmental concern, it's not inherently ""safer"" than car emissions from a global climate change perspective.  The overall impact of car emissions is currently larger.

564,Has Justin Timberlake ever written a song about Britney Spears?,"Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears were a famous couple, and their relationship was heavily publicized.  While they have not collaborated on a song explicitly *about* their relationship, it's plausible that some of Timberlake's songs, particularly those released around the time of their relationship and breakup, contain allusions or references to their time together.  However, there is no definitive evidence of a song explicitly titled or solely focused on Britney Spears written by Justin Timberlake.  Therefore, a conclusive ""yes"" is unlikely.

"
572,WIll Noah's Ark hypothetically sail through flooded Lincoln Tunnel?,"Noah's Ark, as described in the biblical story, was a massive vessel designed to withstand a global flood.  The Lincoln Tunnel, while submerged during a flood, would likely be obstructed by debris and structural damage.  The size and structural integrity of Noah's Ark, even hypothetically, would still present significant challenges in navigating such an environment.  Whether it could successfully sail through a flooded Lincoln Tunnel depends on many uncertain factors such as the extent of the flooding, the presence of debris, and the structural integrity of the tunnel itself, making it an unlikely scenario.

578,Was 1941 Operation Barbarossa related to The Crusades?,"Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, was not directly related to the Crusades.  While both involved large-scale military campaigns, they were separated by centuries and had vastly different motivations and contexts.  The Crusades were religious wars fought between Christians and Muslims over control of the Holy Land, lasting from the 11th to the 15th centuries. Operation Barbarossa was a secular, expansionist war driven by Nazi ideology, aiming to conquer territory and resources in Eastern Europe.  There is no historical connection or causal link between the two events.

581,Would The Dark Knight be appropriate for a preschool class?,"The Dark Knight is a superhero film known for its intense violence, complex themes, and mature content.  It features scenes of graphic violence, intense action sequences, and morally ambiguous characters.  This content is entirely inappropriate for preschoolers, who lack the cognitive and emotional maturity to process such material.  The film's themes of crime, corruption, and vengeance are too sophisticated and potentially disturbing for young children.

Answer: {false}
"
582,Can a computer be programmed entirely in Boolean algebra?,"Boolean algebra is a system of algebra where variables can only have two values, typically represented as 0 and 1 (or true and false).  While it forms the fundamental basis of digital logic and computer operations, a computer cannot be *entirely* programmed using only Boolean algebra in a human-readable and practical way.

Here's why:

* **Abstraction Layers:**  Modern programming relies on numerous levels of abstraction.  Boolean algebra operates at the very lowest level, representing individual logic gates.  Higher-level constructs like loops, functions, data structures, and object-oriented programming concepts are completely absent in pure Boolean algebra.  These abstractions are crucial for managing the complexity of even simple programs.

* **Data Representation:**  Boolean algebra directly manipulates bits, but doesn't inherently define how to represent complex data types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or strings.  While you could theoretically encode these using binary, the process would be extremely cumbersome and inefficient for a programmer to handle.

* **Algorithms and Control Flow:**  Programming involves creating algorithms and controlling the flow of execution. While you can simulate loops and conditional statements using Boolean logic gates, it would be incredibly complex and difficult to design and comprehend. The resulting code would be virtually unreadable and unwieldy.

* **Input/Output:**   Interacting with the outside world, such as reading from a keyboard or displaying data on a screen, requires sophisticated mechanisms far beyond the scope of pure Boolean algebra.

In short, Boolean algebra is a foundational building block of computer programming, but it's not sufficient on its own to create anything beyond the simplest digital circuits. The higher-level programming languages we use today provide the necessary abstraction and tools to build complex programs in a manageable way.

"
588,Can paratroopers be used in a vacuum?,"Paratroopers require atmospheric pressure to deploy their parachutes effectively.  A parachute relies on air resistance to slow the descent of the paratrooper.  In a vacuum, there is no air, and therefore no air resistance. Without air resistance, the parachute would be useless, and the paratrooper would experience a fatal, uncontrolled fall.

591,Do all of the African regions that participated in the Portugese Colonial War share an official language?,"The Portuguese Colonial War involved multiple African territories, primarily in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau.  While Portuguese was an official language in all three of these colonies during the colonial era, their current official languages vary.  Angola has Portuguese as an official language, but also recognizes other languages. Mozambique also has Portuguese as an official language, alongside others. Guinea-Bissau similarly uses Portuguese as an official language along with other local languages. Therefore, although they all shared Portuguese as an official language under Portuguese rule, they don't all share an official language in their current post-colonial states.

Answer: {false}
"
592,Can you find a railroad engineer on TNT?,"The question asks if a railroad engineer can be found on TNT.  TNT is a television network known for airing various genres of programming, including dramas, action, reality shows, and movies.  While there's no single, definitive show on TNT specifically focused on railroad engineers, it's plausible that a character with that profession could appear in any number of their shows.  The absence of a show explicitly about railroad engineers doesn't preclude the existence of a railroad engineer as a character in a broader narrative.

"
600,Are vinegar pickled cucumbers rich in lactobacillus?,"Vinegar-based pickles are made through a process of fermentation using vinegar, salt, and spices.  This is different from lacto-fermentation, which relies on naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria (like Lactobacillus) to ferment the cucumbers.  Lactobacillus is a key component in the fermentation process of *lacto-fermented* pickles, creating their characteristic tangy flavor and beneficial probiotics.  Vinegar pickles, however, use vinegar as the acidifying agent, which prevents the growth of Lactobacillus. While some lactic acid bacteria might be present in the cucumbers initially, the high acidity of the vinegar inhibits their significant growth and propagation during the pickling process.  Therefore, vinegar pickles are not rich in Lactobacillus.

Answer: {false}
"
601,Could George Washington's own speeches have been recorded live to a compact disc?,"George Washington lived from 1732 to 1799.  Compact discs (CDs) were invented in the late 1970s. Therefore, it would have been impossible to record his speeches live to a CD.

"
610,Did Disney get most of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book profits?,"The Disney film adaptation of *The Jungle Book* is based on Rudyard Kipling's works, but the film's profits are not directly tied to Kipling's estate.  Kipling's works are in the public domain in many countries, meaning Disney did not need to pay royalties for the core story elements.  While Disney may have paid for some specific rights or adaptations, the vast majority of the profits from the film would have gone to Disney itself, rather than to Kipling's heirs.

Answer: {true}
"
611,Did Lamarck and Darwin agree about the origin of species diversity?,"Lamarck's theory of evolution was based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics.  Organisms, he believed, could pass on traits acquired during their lifetime to their offspring.  This was a mechanism to explain adaptation and the origin of species diversity.  

Darwin, on the other hand, proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection.  He argued that variations within a population are heritable, and that those individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits to their offspring.  While both acknowledged that species change over time, their proposed mechanisms were fundamentally different.  Darwin's mechanism does not rely on the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

Therefore, Lamarck and Darwin did not agree on the origin of species diversity, differing significantly in their proposed mechanisms of evolutionary change.

Answer: {false}
"
612,Are those incapable of reproduction incapable of parenthood?,"Explanation:

The question asks if those incapable of reproduction are also incapable of parenthood.  Parenthood is defined by the social role and responsibilities of raising a child, not solely by biological contribution.  Many people become parents through adoption or surrogacy, even if they are biologically incapable of reproduction. Therefore, the inability to reproduce does not preclude someone from being a parent.

"
613,Do guitarist's have fingers that can handle pain better than average?,"There's no scientific evidence to suggest guitarists have a higher pain tolerance in their fingers than the average person.  While repeated playing might lead to calluses and some desensitization to pressure, this is not the same as a higher pain threshold for other types of pain or injuries.  Pain tolerance is complex and varies greatly between individuals based on genetics, experiences, and psychological factors.  Guitar playing may toughen fingertips, but it doesn't inherently make them more resilient to all types of pain.

Answer: {false}

615,"Would a 900,000 pound net worth person be an American billionaire if they exchange currency June 2020?","The question asks if a person with a net worth of £900,000 would be a US billionaire if they exchanged their currency in June 2020.  The provided solution makes an error in calculation and also in its reasoning.  It incorrectly converts pounds to dollars using an irrelevant euro exchange rate.  The correct approach is to directly convert pounds to dollars using the GBP/USD exchange rate from June 2020.  

Looking up historical exchange rates, the GBP/USD rate in June 2020 fluctuated but generally stayed below 1.40. Let's assume a conservative average rate of 1.30 for the sake of calculation.  Therefore:

£900,000 * 1.30 USD/GBP ≈ $1,170,000

This amount is significantly less than $1 billion. Therefore, a person with a net worth of £900,000 in June 2020 would not be a US billionaire after currency exchange.

Answer: {false}

637,If someone loves buffalo wings do they enjoy capsaicin?,"Buffalo wings are typically seasoned with hot sauce, which contains capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their spiciness.  If someone loves buffalo wings, it's likely they enjoy the taste and sensation of capsaicin, though the level of spiciness they prefer can vary.  However, it's possible to like buffalo wings and not enjoy the capsaicin itself, if, for instance, they prefer a very mild sauce.  But in most cases, a love of buffalo wings implies at least some tolerance, if not enjoyment, of capsaicin.

642,Should you be skeptical of a 21 year old claiming to have a doctorate?,"Explanation:
The typical path to earning a doctorate involves completing a significant amount of undergraduate and graduate coursework, plus substantial research and dissertation writing. This process usually takes many years, often spanning well into one's twenties or thirties, and sometimes even longer.  While exceptionally rare cases exist, a 21-year-old holding a doctorate would be highly unusual and should prompt skepticism.  The timeline for obtaining a doctorate typically doesn't align with achieving one at such a young age.  There could be exceptional circumstances, but the probability is extremely low.

"
643,Are deaf people left out of enjoying music?,"Deaf individuals experience music differently than hearing individuals.  While they may not perceive sound waves in the same way, they can still appreciate music through the physical sensations of vibrations, the visual aspects of performances (lighting, movements), and the emotional context of the music.  Many deaf people have a deep connection to music and find enjoyment in it through these alternative avenues.  Therefore, to say they are *entirely* left out is inaccurate.  They experience it in a different, but not necessarily less fulfilling, way.

644,Could Aretha Franklin vote for a president when her second child was born?,"Aretha Franklin's second child was born in 1961.  The 23rd Amendment to the United States Constitution, granting Washington D.C. residents the right to vote in presidential elections, was ratified in 1961.  However, this only applies to Washington D.C. residents.  Aretha Franklin lived in Michigan at the time.

646,Do ants outperform apes on language ability?,"Explanation:
Ants do not possess the capacity for language in the same way apes do. Apes, particularly chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans, have demonstrated the ability to understand and use symbolic communication systems, although their linguistic abilities are significantly less complex than human language.  Ants communicate through pheromones and other chemical signals, which are not considered a form of language comparable to that of apes. Therefore, apes significantly outperform ants in language ability.

"
648,Would a hippie hypothetically be bummed out by Augustus's Pax Romana?,"Answer: A hippie, associated with counter-culture movements emphasizing peace, love, and anti-establishment ideals, would likely find the Pax Romana, a period of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire under Augustus,  to be contradictory to their values.  The Pax Romana, while bringing peace, was also maintained through authoritarian rule, military might, and the oppression of conquered peoples.  These aspects would clash with a hippie's preference for non-violence, social justice, and self-determination. Therefore, a hippie would likely be ""bummed out"" by the inherent contradictions and authoritarianism within the Pax Romana.

Answer: {true}
"
649,Can musicians become knights?,"Musicians can be knighted, although it's not a common occurrence and is typically based on contributions beyond music.  Knighthoods are usually bestowed by monarchs or heads of state in recognition of significant service to the country or a particular cause. While musical achievement can be a factor, it often needs to be coupled with broader societal contributions or philanthropic work.  Many musicians have been knighted, receiving titles such as ""Sir"" or ""Dame,"" for their achievements and impact, but it is not an automatic outcome of musical success alone.

652,"If you have black hair and want red hair, do you need bleach?","To achieve red hair from black hair, you need to lighten the existing black pigment.  Black hair contains a significant amount of melanin, which is a dark pigment.  Red hair dye will not be able to effectively deposit the red pigment over the dark black pigment.  The only way to reliably get a vibrant red color on naturally black hair is to first lighten the hair to a level where the red dye can take properly.  This lightening process typically involves bleaching.

660,Has Drew Carey outshined Doug Davidson's tenure?,"Drew Carey took over hosting duties for ""The Price is Right"" from Bob Barker in 2007.  Doug Davidson's long-running role on ""The Young and the Restless"" spanned decades, from 1978 to 2019. While both enjoyed significant success in their respective fields, comparing their achievements directly is difficult due to the different mediums and criteria for success.  Drew Carey's hosting of a long-running game show is a significant accomplishment, but Doug Davidson's decades-long portrayal of a single character on a soap opera represents a different kind of sustained success.  Neither definitively ""outshone"" the other.  The question of who had a more impactful or successful career is subjective and depends on the criteria used for evaluation.

Answer: {false}
"
661,Do embalmed bodies feel different at funerals?,"Embalming involves the removal of blood and other fluids and their replacement with preservatives.  This process significantly alters the body's tissues, making them firmer and less pliable than a living body.  The skin may also appear differently, possibly waxy or discolored. Because the body's natural processes have been halted, there will be no warmth or pulse. The overall feel of an embalmed body would be noticeably different than a living person.

668,Would E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial alien hypothetically love Friendly's?,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is depicted as an alien who enjoys Reese's Pieces candy.  Friendly's is an ice cream parlor.  While there is no direct connection between E.T. liking Reese's Pieces and liking Friendly's, there is no evidence to suggest that E.T. would *dislike* Friendly's. The film does not show any aversion to sweets or human foods. He shows a strong preference for sweet treats, and Friendly's offers various sweets, primarily ice cream. It's plausible he might enjoy their offerings.

Answer: {true}
"
669,Do quadragenarian's have little memory capacity?,"The statement ""quadragenarians have little memory capacity"" is a generalization and is not supported by scientific evidence.  Memory capacity and function are influenced by various factors, including genetics, lifestyle, overall health, and the presence of any cognitive impairments.  Age is a factor, but memory decline is not uniform or inevitable at age 40. Some people experience memory changes as they age, but many do not. There is a wide range of normal memory function in people in their 40s.  To claim that quadragenarians (people in their 40s) have *little* memory capacity is inaccurate and a sweeping generalization.

"
670,Did any country in Portuguese Colonial War share Switzerlands role in WWII?,"Switzerland remained neutral during World War II.  Portugal, while officially neutral for much of World War II,  actively aided the Allied war effort through its overseas territories (particularly in the Atlantic) and by allowing Allied aircraft to land and refuel.  Portugal's colonial war, however, was fought against independence movements in its African colonies, primarily Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau.  These conflicts were completely separate from and did not mirror Switzerland's neutrality in the global context of WWII. There's no comparison between Portugal's actions in its colonial war and Switzerland's neutrality during WWII.

Folk music generally refers to traditional music originating from a specific culture or region, often passed down through generations.  It typically features acoustic instruments and vocals, focusing on storytelling and themes of everyday life, love, and nature.  Metal music, on the other hand, is characterized by amplified electric guitars, distorted sounds, aggressive vocals, and often darker, more complex lyrical themes. While some subgenres of metal might incorporate folk influences (folk metal), metal itself is not considered a type of folk music.

677,Would the historic Hattori Hanzō admire Naruto?,"Hattori Hanzō was a renowned ninja and swordsman known for his skill, loyalty, and dedication to his lord.  Naruto Uzumaki, the main character of the Naruto anime series, is also a skilled ninja known for his unwavering loyalty to his friends and village, and his strong sense of justice.  While their methods and eras are different, both share a strong sense of duty and dedication to those they protect, along with incredible fighting abilities.  Hattori Hanzō likely would admire Naruto's strength, determination, and commitment to his ideals, even if he might disapprove of some of Naruto's more unconventional methods.

680,Can you avoid internet trolls on reddit?,"Reddit is a platform with a vast and diverse user base.  While it offers opportunities for engaging discussions and community building, it also attracts users who intentionally disrupt conversations through trolling.  Completely avoiding trolls on Reddit is realistically impossible, as their tactics can be subtle and varied.  However, minimizing your interactions with them is achievable.  Strategies include:

* **Ignoring provocative comments:**  Often, trolls thrive on reactions.  Not engaging with their posts deprives them of the attention they seek.
* **Utilizing Reddit's reporting tools:** Reddit provides mechanisms to report harmful or inappropriate content, including trolling.  Reporting gives moderators the chance to remove offensive posts and potentially ban users.
* **Participating in well-moderated subreddits:** Subreddits with active and engaged moderators are more likely to enforce rules against trolling and harassment.  Choose communities with clear rules and a commitment to maintaining a respectful environment.
* **Being mindful of your own interactions:** Avoid responding aggressively or emotionally to potentially trollish comments.  A calm and measured response can prevent escalating a situation.
* **Not feeding the troll:**  Engaging in arguments or debates with trolls only encourages their behavior.  If a comment is clearly meant to provoke, it’s often best to simply ignore it.
* **Blocking users:** If you repeatedly encounter a specific user who is trolling you, blocking them prevents further interaction.

Avoiding all interaction with trolls is an unrealistic expectation on a platform as large as Reddit, but employing these strategies can significantly reduce the frequency and impact of encountering them.

"
685,Are there any chives hypothetically good for battling vampires?,"Garlic is a well-known (though fictional) vampire repellent.  Chives are in the same family as garlic (Alliaceae), sharing similar chemical compounds, particularly allicin, which is responsible for the pungent odor and purported vampire-repelling properties of garlic. While there's no scientific evidence that either garlic or chives repel vampires,  the shared family and similar chemical makeup suggest a hypothetical possibility that chives might also be effective.  This is purely speculative and based on folklore.

Answer: {true}
"
686,Are Doctors of Homeopathy more likely than Doctors of Internal Medicine to recommend Quartz as a treatment?,"Doctors of Homeopathy, practitioners of alternative medicine, often incorporate substances like quartz into their treatments based on beliefs not supported by scientific evidence.

Therefore, Doctors of Homeopathy are far more likely to recommend quartz than Doctors of Internal Medicine.

687,Can a banana get a virus?,"Bananas, being plants, can be affected by diseases caused by viruses.  While they don't get viruses in the same way humans or animals do (they don't have an immune system that responds in the same way), plant viruses can infect banana plants and cause significant damage. These viruses can affect the growth, yield, and quality of the fruit.  Therefore, the answer is yes.

Answer: {true}
"
688,Is the Very Large Telescope the most productive telescope in the world?,"The question asks whether the Very Large Telescope (VLT) is the most productive telescope in the world.  Productivity in astronomy can be measured in many ways, including the number of scientific papers published based on its observations, the impact of those papers on the field, the breadth of scientific areas it covers, and the sheer volume of data it produces. While the VLT is a highly productive and influential telescope, it's difficult to definitively say it's *the* most productive globally.  There are other extremely productive telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope (which has a vast archive and legacy of impactful research) and various ground-based telescopes with extensive survey programs that produce enormous datasets.  Determining the ""most productive"" would require a detailed quantitative comparison across multiple metrics, which is beyond the scope of a simple answer. Therefore, a definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" is not possible.


Answer: {false}
"
689,Would Statue of Liberty be visible if submerged in Bohai Sea?,"The Statue of Liberty is approximately 305 feet tall.  The Bohai Sea is a relatively shallow sea, but its average depth varies considerably.  Even if we assume the Statue of Liberty were placed in a relatively shallow area of the Bohai Sea,  a significant portion, if not all, of the statue would still be visible above the waterline.  The statue's pedestal further adds to its height above sea level. Therefore, it is unlikely that the entire statue would be submerged.

Answer: {false}
"
690,Do flying fish have good eyesight?,"Flying fish are known for their ability to glide through the air, using their large pectoral fins.  While this impressive feat requires excellent coordination and control, there's no readily available information suggesting they possess exceptionally good eyesight compared to other fish.  Their eyesight likely serves their needs in their environment, which includes both aerial and aquatic phases.  The crucial aspect for their ""flight"" is not necessarily superior vision, but rather their hydrodynamic body shape and fin structure.  Lacking definitive information on exceptional eyesight, we cannot definitively say they have *good* eyesight, only that they have eyesight sufficient for their survival needs.

Answer: {false}
"
691,Would JPEG be a good format for saving an image of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man?,"JPEG is a lossy compression format, meaning it discards some image data to reduce file size.  While this is good for photos with lots of subtle color gradations, it's not ideal for line art or images with sharp details like Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.  Lossy compression can blur the fine lines and details in the drawing, degrading the image quality.  A lossless format like PNG or TIFF would be far better for preserving the integrity of the artwork.

697,Can a false pope become a saint?,"The process of sainthood in the Catholic Church involves rigorous investigation into the life and virtues of the candidate.  A key element is the examination of their adherence to Catholic doctrine and practice.  A ""false pope,"" by definition, would be someone who claimed the papacy illegitimately, possibly acting against Church teachings or even schismatic.  Such actions would likely preclude canonization, as sainthood requires demonstrating a life of holiness and conformity to the Church's beliefs.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a ""false pope"" could become a saint.

701,Do anatomical and symbolic hearts look remarkably different?,"Anatomical hearts are actual organs, muscular pumps responsible for circulating blood.  They have a specific structure with chambers, valves, blood vessels, and tissues.  Symbolic hearts, on the other hand, are representations of the anatomical heart, often stylized or simplified. These can vary widely in appearance, ranging from a simple outline to intricate drawings, cartoons, or even abstract designs.  While a symbolic heart might use the basic shape of an anatomical heart as a starting point, it will typically lack the anatomical details and often prioritize conveying emotion or meaning over accuracy.  Therefore, anatomical and symbolic hearts can look remarkably different.

703,"While on a liquid diet, are there some types of soup you cannot eat?","A liquid diet, by definition, consists only of liquids.  While some soups might be thin enough to qualify, many are not.  Chunky soups, soups with solid ingredients like vegetables, noodles, or meat, would not be considered part of a liquid diet. Even pureed soups might have a texture too thick to be acceptable depending on the strictness of the diet's prescription.  Therefore, most soups, excluding very thin broth-like soups, would be inappropriate.

Answer: {true}

708,Can you transport a primate in a backpack?,"The answer depends on several factors, including the size of the primate, the size of the backpack, and applicable laws and regulations.  While it's *physically possible* to fit a very small primate in a backpack, it's highly unlikely to be legal or ethical.  Most primates are significantly larger than would fit comfortably or safely in a backpack.  Transporting a primate, regardless of size, would likely require special permits and containers to ensure the animal's safety and well-being.  Furthermore, many jurisdictions have strict regulations on the transportation of animals, particularly those considered endangered or exotic.  Attempting to transport a primate in a backpack without proper permits and consideration for the animal's welfare would be irresponsible and possibly illegal.

Answer: {false}
"
709,Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?,"To answer this question, we need to estimate the album sales of AC/DC and Lil Wayne, and then compare the cost of B-52 bombers.  This is a complex task requiring significant research into album sales figures and the cost of B-52 bombers which is highly classified information.  Moreover, accurate and reliable data on album sales is often difficult to obtain, especially when considering differing formats (vinyl, CD, digital downloads, streaming). The cost of a B-52 bomber is also unlikely to be publicly available in a way we could access. Therefore, a precise comparison is not feasible without dedicated research beyond the scope of this response.  While we could make estimates based on rough figures easily found online, that would lead to a highly speculative and likely inaccurate answer.

710,Is Ludacris in same music genre as 2000's Binaural?,"Ludacris is primarily known for his work in hip hop and rap music.  Binaural, as a term referring to a music genre from the 2000s, isn't a standard or widely recognized categorization. While some bands might use binaural recording techniques (which involve recording sound in a way to mimic human hearing), this is a recording method, not a genre.  There's no established ""Binaural"" music genre to compare Ludacris to. Therefore, they cannot be in the same genre.

712,"Could pickled cucumbers from 1,000 years ago be good still?","Answer: Pickled cucumbers rely on a process of fermentation and preservation using salt and/or vinegar to inhibit the growth of microorganisms that cause spoilage.  While this process can extend the shelf life of cucumbers significantly, 1,000 years is far beyond the reasonable limit of preservation, even for extremely well-preserved foods. The environmental conditions over such a span would almost certainly lead to spoilage, decomposition, and the growth of harmful bacteria, rendering the pickles unsafe and inedible.

Answer: {false}
"
713,Do Flat Earthers doubt the existence of Earth's magnetic field?,"Flat-Earth theory rejects the spherical model of Earth.  The existence of a global magnetic field is strong evidence for a spherical Earth.  The magnetic field lines observed around the Earth are consistent with a dipole magnet at the center of a sphere.  A flat Earth model doesn't offer a satisfactory explanation for the observed magnetic field.  Therefore, it's highly probable that Flat-Earthers would doubt or attempt to reinterpret the existence and nature of Earth's magnetic field.

Answer: {true}

716,Are brown rock fish found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis?,"Brown rockfish are a type of fish found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, specifically along the coast of North America.  Saint Kitts and Nevis are islands in the Caribbean Sea. The waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis are part of the Caribbean Sea and are not geographically linked to the northeastern Pacific Ocean where brown rockfish are found.  Therefore, brown rockfish are highly unlikely to be found in the waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Answer: {false}
"
717,Does 2015 have more unlucky Friday's than usual?,"To determine if 2015 had more unlucky Fridays than usual, we need to understand what constitutes an ""unlucky Friday"" and how frequently they occur.  An unlucky Friday is typically considered to be Friday the 13th.  There are 12 months in a year, so a year can have at most one Friday the 13th per month.  Therefore, a year can have at most three Friday the 13ths.  Some years have none, some have one, and some have two, or even three, but three is the maximum.

Let's check the calendar for 2015:

* January 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* February 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* March 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* April 2015: Friday the 13th occurs
* May 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* June 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* July 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* August 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* September 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* October 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* November 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur
* December 2015: Friday the 13th does NOT occur

2015 only had one Friday the 13th.  This is not more than usual; it's a relatively average number.

"
720,Do bodies movie during hanging?,"The movement of a body during hanging depends on several factors, including the method of hanging, the weight of the individual, and the position of the body.  While some movement might occur immediately after the drop due to the initial momentum, significant, sustained movement after the initial drop is unlikely. The body will eventually become still as the weight of the body tenses the rope or ligature, and the blood supply to the brain is cut off. While there can be minor post-mortem muscle spasms, these are involuntary and not a sustained, significant movement of the whole body.

Answer: {false}

727,Would someone with a nosebleed benefit from Coca?,"Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink.  A nosebleed, or epistaxis, is bleeding from the nose.  While Coca-Cola is cold and might temporarily constrict blood vessels, it is not a medically appropriate treatment for a nosebleed.  Applying direct pressure to the nose is the recommended first aid for a nosebleed.  Drinking Coca-Cola would not help stop the bleeding and could potentially worsen the situation.

"
728,Does Justin Bieber vote in October?,"Answer: Justin Bieber is a Canadian citizen.  Canadian federal elections are not held in October.  Therefore, Justin Bieber would not be voting in October in a Canadian federal election.  While he *could* vote in a municipal or provincial election depending on the specific date in October and his location, the question is ambiguous and lacks context.  It's highly improbable Justin Bieber would be voting in October in any election.

731,Could a young Wizard of Oz Scarecrow have gotten Cerebral palsy?,"Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle tone or posture.  It's caused by damage to the developing brain, most often before birth.  A Scarecrow, being a fictional character made of straw and other materials, does not have a brain capable of being damaged in the way that would cause cerebral palsy.  Therefore, a Scarecrow could not have cerebral palsy.

"
736,Did Native American tribes teach Spaniards how to cultivate maize?,"Explanation:
Historical accounts suggest that the cultivation of maize (corn) was already well-established among various Native American tribes in the Americas long before the arrival of the Spanish.  The Spanish, upon encountering maize cultivation, adopted and spread the knowledge of growing this crop to other parts of the world.  Therefore, while the Spanish learned about maize cultivation from Native Americans, it's inaccurate to say they *taught* the Spaniards.  The knowledge transfer was primarily in the opposite direction.

738,Can your psychologist say hello to you while you are out at the supermarket?,"Explanation: A psychologist's professional relationship with a client is typically confined to the therapeutic setting.  While a psychologist might recognize a client outside of their office,  they would generally not initiate a conversation, especially in a casual public setting like a supermarket, without prior consent from the client and a pre-arranged meeting. This is to maintain professional boundaries and respect the client's privacy.  Therefore, it is unlikely a psychologist would ""say hello"" in this scenario without a prior understanding or expectation.

739,Is Hamlet more common on IMDB than Comedy of Errors?,"To determine whether ""Hamlet"" is more common on IMDB than ""Comedy of Errors,"" we need to consider the frequency with which each play appears in various contexts on IMDB.  This could include the number of times the titles are listed in cast and crew credits, as titles of movies and TV shows that are adaptations, or in user reviews and comments.  Without access to IMDB's internal database and search algorithms, it's impossible to definitively state which play appears more frequently.  However, ""Hamlet,"" being a much more famous and frequently adapted Shakespearean play, is likely to appear far more often than ""The Comedy of Errors.""

748,Did France win the French Revolution?,"The French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event with no single victor.  While the revolution ultimately led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic, it was a period of intense internal conflict, violence, and shifting alliances.  Different factions fought for power, and the revolution itself went through several distinct phases, marked by upheaval and instability.  France as a nation-state continued to exist, but the revolution fundamentally altered its political and social landscape. Therefore, to say France ""won"" is inaccurate and oversimplifies the historical reality.

Answer: {false}
"
749,Are classic nintendo games for emulator legal?,"The legality of emulating classic Nintendo games is complex and depends on several factors, primarily copyright law.  While emulators themselves are generally legal (as they are simply software programs that mimic the function of a game console),  using ROMs (Read-Only Memory) of copyrighted games without permission from the copyright holder (Nintendo) is illegal.  Distribution of ROMs is also illegal.  Therefore, possessing and playing ROMs of Nintendo games obtained without proper authorization is a copyright infringement.  The legal landscape is further complicated by the fact that Nintendo actively pursues legal action against those involved in ROM distribution, but rarely targets individual users playing ROMs for personal, non-commercial use.  However, this doesn't make it legal; it simply reflects Nintendo's enforcement priorities.

Answer: {false}

754,Can you give at least one word from the Torah to all residents of Bunkie Louisiana?,"The Torah, also known as the Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses, is a foundational text of Judaism.  It contains Hebrew words, and it's impossible to provide a single word from the Torah that would be relevant or meaningful to *all* residents of Bunkie, Louisiana, a diverse community with varied religious and cultural backgrounds.  A word from the Torah would hold significance for Jewish residents, but not necessarily for others.  There is no single Hebrew word that can universally resonate across a population without specific context.

"
755,Can eating your weight in celery prevent diabetes?,"Explanation:

Celery is low in calories and high in fiber, both of which are beneficial for managing blood sugar levels.  However, there's no scientific evidence to support the claim that eating your weight in celery can prevent diabetes.  Diabetes is a complex disease with multiple contributing factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and other health conditions. While a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables (including celery), and whole grains is part of a diabetes prevention strategy,  the sheer volume of celery required would be unrealistic and potentially harmful (due to the high fiber content causing digestive issues).  The focus should be on a balanced, overall healthy diet and lifestyle, not a single food.

Answer: {false}
"
756,Is 500GB USB device enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day?,"Explanation:
First, we need to estimate the data size of 10 hours of Netflix shows.  The quality of the video stream significantly affects file size.  Netflix streams at various bitrates, depending on the user's internet connection and settings.  A reasonable estimate for 1080p high-definition video is around 7GB per hour. Therefore, 10 hours of Netflix would consume approximately 70GB (7GB/hour * 10 hours).

A 500GB USB drive has 500GB of storage.  If we only consider the video data, the USB drive could theoretically store approximately 7 days of 10-hour Netflix viewing (500GB / 70GB/day ≈ 7 days).  However, this is a simplified calculation.  It doesn't account for other factors:

* **Variations in bitrate:** Netflix dynamically adjusts the bitrate based on network conditions. This means some hours might be larger or smaller than 7GB.
* **Metadata:**  The video file likely includes metadata that will increase the total size.
* **Other files:** The user might store other files on the drive, which would further reduce the available space for Netflix videos.

Considering these factors, while a 500GB drive could *potentially* store several days of Netflix viewing, it's not guaranteed to store 10 hours per day indefinitely, and it is unlikely. The buffer space needed will diminish rapidly.


Answer: {false}
"
757,Can Arnold Schwarzenegger deadlift an adult Black rhinoceros?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:

While Arnold Schwarzenegger is incredibly strong, a Black rhinoceros is an extremely large and heavy animal.  Adult Black rhinoceroses can weigh between 2,200 and 3,300 pounds.  Even for a world-class strongman like Schwarzenegger, deadlifting an animal of this size and weight is physically impossible.  The sheer mass and the awkwardness of lifting a live animal would make this feat impossible.
"
758,Are there multiple Star Wars TV shows produced by Disney?,"Disney, through its Lucasfilm subsidiary, has produced multiple Star Wars television series.

"
759,Did polio medicine save the life of polio vaccine creator?,"Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine.  The polio vaccine was created *after* the majority of polio cases were treated with other methods.  While the vaccine prevented future polio cases, it wouldn't have saved someone who had already contracted the disease and was already being treated with other means before its invention.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely the polio vaccine itself saved Salk's life.

"
761,Could the Port of Baltimore handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year?,"To determine if the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year, we need to consider the port's capacity and the global ginger production volume.

Let's make some reasonable estimations.  We lack precise data on the exact annual global ginger production volume in metric tons, and the precise handling capacity of the Port of Baltimore in terms of specific spices. However, we can make a reasonable comparison using available information.  

The Port of Baltimore handles a massive amount of cargo annually,  including many different types of goods. The volume of ginger, while a significant agricultural product, is relatively small compared to other major commodities like grain, iron ore, or manufactured goods.

Therefore, it's highly probable that the Port of Baltimore, with its extensive infrastructure and handling capabilities, could easily handle the entire world's annual ginger production. The ginger production volume would likely represent a small fraction of the port's overall cargo volume.

"
765,Could an ocelot subsist on a single bee hummingbird per day?,"An ocelot is a small wild cat, a carnivore that requires a diet consisting primarily of meat.  Bee hummingbirds are extremely small birds. While an ocelot might *kill* a bee hummingbird, the hummingbird's size means it would provide a negligible amount of calories and nutrients compared to the ocelot's daily energy requirements.  A single bee hummingbird would not be sufficient to sustain an ocelot's life for even a single day.

Answer: {false}

"
768,Is there any absolute way to prevent abortion?,"There is no absolute way to prevent abortion.  While various measures such as comprehensive sex education, readily available and affordable contraception, and strict laws against abortion can significantly reduce the number of abortions, none can eliminate them entirely.  Human behavior is complex and diverse, and regardless of legal or social pressures, some individuals will always seek to terminate pregnancies for various reasons.  Furthermore, the clandestine nature of illegal abortions often results in dangerous and potentially life-threatening procedures.

774,Did Richard Wagner support the Nazis?,"Richard Wagner died in 1883, decades before the Nazi party came to power.  However, his antisemitic writings and the appropriation of his music and imagery by the Nazis after his death strongly link him to the ideology, even posthumously. While he didn't directly support the Nazis, his work provided fertile ground for their propaganda and his anti-Jewish views resonate with Nazi ideology.

775,Does Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint?,"The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a sui juris Eastern Catholic church in full communion with the Pope.  While it shares some saints with the Eastern Orthodox Churches, its official canon of saints is distinct and determined by its own synod. Alexander Nevsky is venerated as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church and some other Orthodox churches. However, there's no indication that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church recognizes Alexander Nevsky as a saint.  Given the historical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and the significant differences between the two church traditions, it's highly unlikely that Alexander Nevsky would be included in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church's official saints.

776,Would it be difficult to host Stanley Cup Finals at Rock in Rio?,"Rock in Rio is a massive outdoor music festival held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The Stanley Cup Finals are a major professional ice hockey championship series requiring a large, enclosed arena with ice rink facilities, specialized lighting, and seating for tens of thousands of spectators.  These are vastly different events requiring significantly different infrastructure and logistics.  Building an ice rink temporarily at Rock in Rio's location would be enormously expensive and logistically complex, and would drastically alter the festival's setup.  The necessary infrastructure, including refrigeration and climate control for an ice rink, simply doesn't exist at Rock in Rio and would be impractical to implement for a short-term event.  Furthermore, the timing conflicts are obvious: the Stanley Cup Finals have a set schedule; Rock in Rio happens at a specific time each year and doesn't have the flexibility to pause for an entirely different event.

781,Is Mixed martial arts totally original from Roman Colosseum games?,"Mixed martial arts (MMA) shares some similarities with combat sports practiced in the Roman Colosseum, such as gladiatorial contests, but it is not a direct derivative.  While both involve fighting between individuals, MMA has evolved from a variety of modern combat sports like boxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai, incorporating rules and regulations that are significantly different from the often brutal and unregulated nature of Roman Colosseum spectacles. The Colosseum's contests lacked structured rules and often involved weapons, resulting in significantly higher lethality than modern MMA.  Therefore, although there are thematic overlaps, MMA's origins lie in a distinct evolutionary path separate from the Roman Colosseum.

"
786,Would Doctor Strange like the Pittsburgh Steelers logo?,"Dr. Strange's aesthetic is heavily influenced by mystical and ancient symbolism.  The Pittsburgh Steelers logo, while iconic, is primarily a modern, relatively simple design focused on a stylized letter and color scheme.

"
791,Can Africanized bees be considered multicultural?,"Africanized bees are a hybrid species resulting from the crossbreeding of African honeybees with various European honeybee subspecies.  This crossbreeding involved the mixing of multiple genetic lineages, creating a diverse gene pool. While the term ""multicultural"" typically refers to human societies,  the genetic diversity within Africanized bees stemming from their hybrid origins aligns with the core concept of multiculturalism - the coexistence of diverse cultures within a single entity.  Therefore, applying the concept metaphorically, it's arguable that Africanized bees could be considered multicultural on a genetic level.

792,Could Eddie Hall hypothetically deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger?,"Explanation:
To determine if Eddie Hall could hypothetically deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger, we need to consider the weight of the cheeseburger and Eddie Hall's deadlift record.  The world's largest cheeseburger weighed approximately 1,300 pounds. Eddie Hall's world record deadlift is 1,102 pounds.  Since the cheeseburger's weight exceeds Hall's deadlift record, it's unlikely he could lift it.

"
793,Would it be impossible to keep an ocean sunfish and a goldfish in the same tank?,"Ocean sunfish are incredibly large, reaching up to 5,000 pounds. Goldfish, while varying in size, are significantly smaller.  The space requirements alone for an ocean sunfish would make keeping it in a tank with a goldfish impossible.  Additionally, the dietary and environmental needs of these two species differ dramatically.  An ocean sunfish requires a vast open ocean environment and a specific diet, while a goldfish needs a much smaller, controlled environment and different food.  These differences make cohabitation not only impractical but also extremely harmful for the goldfish.

794,Is the United States the largest exporter of Fair Trade products?,"The question asks if the United States is the largest exporter of Fair Trade products.  To answer this, we need to consider the definition of Fair Trade and the typical exporting countries associated with it. Fair Trade generally focuses on products from developing countries, emphasizing ethical labor practices and sustainable production.  Countries like Mexico, Colombia, and various African and Asian nations are major exporters of Fair Trade goods such as coffee, cocoa, and bananas. While the US might import a significant amount of Fair Trade products, it is not known for being a major exporter of them.  Its economy is geared more toward large-scale, potentially less ethically sourced, production. Therefore, it is highly unlikely the US is the largest exporter of Fair Trade products.

798,Is watching  Star Wars necessary to know who Darth Vader is?,"Darth Vader is one of the most iconic characters in popular culture, and his image and story are widely known even outside of the Star Wars franchise.  While watching the Star Wars films is the definitive way to experience his story and understand his significance, his identity and role as a villain are widely disseminated through various media, including books, comics, video games, and other forms of popular culture.  Therefore, one doesn't *need* to watch Star Wars to know who Darth Vader is.

799,Can you buy a fair trade laptop?,"The question asks if it's possible to buy a fair trade laptop.  Fair trade certification focuses on ensuring ethical and sustainable practices throughout the supply chain, guaranteeing fair wages and safe working conditions for producers. While the concept of fair trade applies to many products, it's less common for complex electronics like laptops. The manufacturing process involves numerous components, suppliers, and assembly stages, making full traceability and fair trade certification across the entire chain extremely challenging.  Although some individual components might be sourced ethically, achieving complete fair trade certification for an entire laptop is currently unlikely.

802,Would ramen be bad for someone with heart failure?,"Ramen noodles, especially instant varieties, are often high in sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol.  These are all factors that can negatively impact individuals with heart failure. High sodium intake can lead to fluid retention, which exacerbates symptoms of heart failure. Saturated and trans fats contribute to high cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart disease and potentially worsening heart failure.  While some nutritional content varies between brands, the general profile of ramen noodles makes them an unsuitable food choice for someone managing heart failure.  A heart-healthy diet is crucial for individuals with heart failure, and ramen doesn't fit that criteria.

811,Can a 2019 Toyota Hilux hypothetically support weight of thirty Big John Studd clones?,"Here's an explanation to determine if a 2019 Toyota Hilux could hypothetically support the weight of thirty Big John Studd clones:

First, we need to estimate Big John Studd's weight.  Sources suggest he weighed around 350 pounds.  Thirty clones would therefore weigh approximately 10,500 pounds (30 x 350).

Next, we need to find the payload capacity of a 2019 Toyota Hilux. This varies slightly depending on the specific trim level and configuration, but a reasonable estimate for the payload capacity is around 1,500 - 2,000 pounds.

Comparing the estimated weight of the thirty Studd clones (10,500 pounds) to the payload capacity of the Hilux (1,500-2,000 pounds), it's clear that the truck would be significantly overloaded.  The weight of the clones far exceeds the Hilux's capacity.  Even distributing the weight wouldn't be sufficient to avoid structural damage or failure.

812,Are any minor league baseball teams named after felines?,"Several minor league baseball teams have names that incorporate felines,  most notably the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (previously the Suns) which uses a shrimp as a mascot and has a somewhat feline-like logo but it is still a shrimp.  However,  there are no teams explicitly named after a specific type of feline such as ""Tigers"", ""Lions"", ""Panthers"", etc., at the minor league level  These names are typically associated with major league teams.  Minor league teams often use more creative and locally-relevant names.

"
815,Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?,"To determine which Albany will reach 100,000 occupants first, we need to compare the current populations and growth rates of Albany, Georgia, and Albany, New York.  While readily available population data will give a current snapshot, predicting future growth accurately requires detailed demographic analysis and forecasting which is beyond the scope of this task.  However, we can make a reasonable inference based on generally available information.

Albany, New York is a significantly larger city than Albany, Georgia.  Albany, New York already has a population well in excess of 100,000.  Albany, Georgia's population is considerably smaller.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that Albany, Georgia will reach 100,000 inhabitants before Albany, New York.

822,Does US brand Nice depend on Western honey bee?,"The question asks if the US brand Nice depends on Western honey bees.  To answer this, we need to know what ""Nice"" refers to.  Assuming ""Nice"" refers to a brand of honey or a product that uses honey, then the answer would depend on whether that brand uses honey from Western honey bees (Apis mellifera).  Most commercially produced honey in the US comes from Western honey bees. Therefore, if Nice uses honey, it is highly likely to depend on Western honey bees.  However, without specific knowledge of the Nice brand's sourcing, we cannot definitively confirm this.

839,Could JPMorgan Chase give every American $10?,"To determine if JPMorgan Chase could give every American $10, we need to consider JPMorgan Chase's assets and the US population.

JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest banks in the world, with trillions of dollars in assets.  However,  it's crucial to distinguish between assets (what the bank owns) and liquid assets (cash readily available).  Giving away $10 to every American would require a significant amount of readily available cash.  While JPMorgan Chase has enormous assets, a large portion is tied up in investments, loans, and other non-liquid forms.

The US population is roughly 330 million.  Distributing $10 to each person would require $3.3 billion.  While this is a substantial sum, it is likely a fraction of JPMorgan Chase's liquid assets. Therefore, it's plausible that JPMorgan Chase could afford this. However, it's important to note that such a decision would be based on numerous factors beyond just financial capability, including corporate strategy, regulatory compliance, and shareholder considerations.

841,Would Dante Alighieri hypothetically place Rupert Murdoch in 8th Circle of Hell?,"Dante Alighieri's *Inferno* describes the eight circle of Hell as Malebolge, a series of ten ditches reserved for fraudsters.  Rupert Murdoch's career, encompassing media ownership and influence, has been the subject of criticism regarding ethical lapses, questionable business practices, and accusations of spreading misinformation. Depending on Dante's interpretation, Murdoch's actions and their impact could be considered fraudulent, making placement in Malebolge plausible.  Therefore, it's hypothetically possible that Dante would place Rupert Murdoch in the 8th Circle of Hell.

Dichromats, individuals with color vision deficiency, may have difficulty distinguishing certain colors, but the difference between yellowish-green and reddish-orange is generally significant enough to be discerned even by those with some degree of color blindness.  The specific type and severity of dichromacy would impact an individual's ability to distinguish these colors, but it's highly probable that a dichromat could differentiate between the two gases.

845,Was Darth Vader monogamous?,"Answer: Darth Vader, as Anakin Skywalker, had a romantic relationship with Padmé Amidala.  However, after becoming Darth Vader, he was arguably not in a position to have any meaningful relationship, let alone a monogamous one.  While his devotion to the Emperor could be seen as a form of singular focus, it wasn't a romantic relationship.  Therefore, whether he was monogamous depends on how strictly you define the term within the context of his drastically altered life.  Considering his transformation and the nature of his existence post-transformation, it's unlikely he could maintain a monogamous relationship.

852,Is electricity necessary to balance an account in Microsoft Excel?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation: Balancing an account in Microsoft Excel involves using formulas and functions to calculate and track financial transactions.  While a computer running Excel requires electricity, the process of balancing the account itself doesn't intrinsically necessitate electricity. The calculations could theoretically be performed manually with a pencil and paper, albeit more laboriously.  The electricity is required for the *tool* used to perform the task (Excel), not the task of accounting itself.

A Toyota Hilux is a pickup truck and its weight will vary by model and features, but generally falls in the range of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds.  Therefore, a Toyota Hilux is likely heavier than even a large horse.

Answer: {true}
"
857,Will Communion be denied to Wednesday name origin followers?,"The question asks whether followers of the religion whose name originates from ""Wednesday"" would be denied Communion.  This hinges on whether that religion is considered a Christian denomination.  ""Wednesday"" is named after Odin's day, Woden's day, in Norse Paganism.  Therefore, a religion deriving its name from Wednesday would likely be non-Christian and thus likely to have different practices regarding communion.  Christian denominations administer communion as a sacrament, and denying it is a significant act. While some Christian denominations may extend communion to non-members of other faiths, it's not guaranteed.  A religion based on Norse Paganism would almost certainly not practice communion in the Christian sense.

"
860,Was the amount of spinach Popeye ate unhealthy?,"Popeye's cartoon portrayal involved consuming massive quantities of spinach in a single sitting.  While spinach is a nutritious vegetable rich in vitamins and minerals, consuming such an excessive amount in one go would be unhealthy.  This level of consumption could lead to digestive issues, such as diarrhea and stomach cramps, due to the high fiber content.  Additionally,  overconsumption of any single food, even a healthy one, can lead to nutritional imbalances and displace other essential nutrients from the diet.  Therefore, the amount of spinach Popeye ate was clearly unrealistic and unhealthy.

862,Would a Jehovah's witness approve of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"Jehovah's Witnesses generally avoid media that promotes spiritism, occultism, or the supernatural.  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland contains elements of fantasy and surrealism, including encounters with characters like the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts who might be interpreted as having supernatural qualities or engaging in magical practices.  While there is no direct promotion of worship or belief in these elements,  the overall tone and content might conflict with the Jehovah's Witness understanding of appropriate entertainment.  Therefore, it is unlikely a Jehovah's Witness would approve.

865,Is Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution popular in court?,"The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits excessive bail and fines, as well as cruel and unusual punishment.  Its application in court is complex and frequently litigated. While not all aspects are universally popular, it's a central element of legal challenges to sentencing, conditions of confinement, and capital punishment.  The interpretation of ""cruel and unusual punishment"" evolves over time with societal values and legal precedent.  Therefore, its ""popularity"" isn't a straightforward yes or no, but rather a statement about its frequent use and ongoing debate in judicial proceedings.  Cases referencing and relying on the Eighth Amendment are commonplace.

"
871,Would a blooming onion be possible with a shallot?,"Blooming onions require a structure that allows for the onion to be sliced in a way that creates the ""blooming"" effect.  Onions have layers that are easily separated to create the distinct petals of a blooming onion.  Shallots, on the other hand, have a much more compact structure with less distinct layering.  While you could attempt to slice a shallot in a similar manner, the result would not resemble a traditional blooming onion due to the shallot's different structure.  The petals would likely be smaller, less distinct, and the overall appearance less impressive.

Answer: {false}
"
872,"In isopropyl alcohol, is the solubility of salt low?","Isopropyl alcohol is a polar solvent, but it is less polar than water.  Salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) is an ionic compound and dissolves well in polar solvents due to ion-dipole interactions.  While isopropyl alcohol can dissolve some salt, its lower polarity compared to water means it won't dissolve as much.  Therefore, the solubility of salt in isopropyl alcohol is low compared to its solubility in water.

874,Can I build a house on an asteroid?,"Explanation:

Building a house on an asteroid presents numerous significant challenges.  Asteroids lack atmospheres and significant gravity, making construction extremely difficult.  The materials needed for construction would have to be transported from Earth, a prohibitively expensive and complex undertaking.  The lack of protection from radiation and extreme temperature fluctuations poses serious health risks.  Even anchoring a structure to an asteroid's surface would be extremely challenging given the irregular shapes and often unstable nature of asteroids.  Finally, the legal and practical considerations of ownership and jurisdiction over an asteroid are largely undefined.

"
878,Can someone with celiac disease have potato vodka?,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.  Potatoes do not contain gluten.  Vodka, by definition, is distilled from a fermented mash, and the distillation process removes gluten proteins. Therefore, potato vodka should be safe for someone with celiac disease.  However, it's crucial to check the label to ensure that no gluten-containing ingredients were added during production (e.g., flavorings, additives).  Cross-contamination during manufacturing is also a possibility to consider, though less likely with a product based on potatoes.

Answer: {true}
"
879,Is polyamory allowed in the Catholic Church?,"The Catholic Church's teachings on marriage are based on the understanding of marriage as a lifelong, exclusive union between one man and one woman, ordained by God.  Polyamory, which involves multiple romantic relationships with the consent of all partners, directly contradicts this fundamental tenet. The Catechism of the Catholic Church emphasizes the sacramental nature of marriage and its indissolubility.  Therefore, polyamorous relationships are not permitted within the framework of Catholic doctrine.

Answer: {false}
"
880,Are there mental disorders you can hide?,"Many mental disorders can be hidden, at least to some degree, depending on the specific disorder and the individual's ability to mask symptoms.  Some disorders are inherently more easily concealed than others.  For example, someone with depression might be able to hide their sadness or fatigue from casual acquaintances, particularly if they are adept at emotional regulation.  However, severe depression often manifests in ways that are difficult to completely mask, such as significant changes in sleep patterns, appetite, or work performance.  Similarly, anxiety disorders can be hidden to a certain extent through avoidance behaviors, but severe anxiety attacks or panic attacks are difficult to conceal.  Furthermore, the individual's motivation to conceal their symptoms plays a significant role. Someone who is ashamed or afraid of stigma may be more successful at hiding their disorder.

However, it's important to note that hiding a mental disorder doesn't make it go away.  Untreated mental health conditions can have significant consequences on an individual's well-being and relationships.  Moreover, attempting to conceal symptoms can be exhausting and can actually worsen the underlying condition.

885,Do you need to schedule separate preventive healthcare and sickness visits?,"The question asks whether preventive healthcare and sickness visits need to be scheduled separately.  The answer depends on the healthcare system and individual provider's policies.  Many systems encourage preventive care, and some might offer combined appointments or bundled services, particularly for routine check-ups that can also address minor concerns. However, others may schedule them separately, especially if a sickness requires immediate attention or specialized care beyond the scope of a routine checkup.  Therefore, there's no universal answer.

Answer: {false}
"
886,Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?,"Here's an explanation to determine if seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed the USDA recommended daily fat allowance:

First, we need to find the fat content of a McDonald's hamburger.  This varies slightly depending on location and specific preparation, but a reasonable estimate for a single McDonald's hamburger is around 10 grams of fat.  Seven hamburgers would therefore contain approximately 70 grams of fat (7 hamburgers * 10 grams/hamburger).

Next, we need to determine the USDA's recommended daily fat intake.  The USDA doesn't provide a single ""recommended"" fat allowance. Instead, it provides guidelines expressed as a percentage of total daily calories.  These guidelines vary based on age, sex, activity level, and overall health goals.  However, a common guideline is to limit saturated and trans fats, and to keep total fat intake to a reasonable percentage of daily calories.  There isn't a single number to compare against easily.

To make a reasonable comparison, let's assume a moderately active adult following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, aiming for a calorie intake of around 2000 calories per day.  The generally recommended range of fat intake is 20-35% of total calories.  This would translate to a range of 44-78 grams of fat (2000 calories * 0.20 = 440 calories from fat / 9 calories per gram = 49 grams of fat and 2000 calories * 0.35 = 700 calories from fat / 9 calories per gram = 78 grams of fat).

Considering that the seven hamburgers contain approximately 70 grams of fat, it is *possible* this is within the higher end of the recommended range for some individuals. However, it's critically important to remember that this only considers fat, not other dietary components like saturated and trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, and calories.  Seven hamburgers would certainly exceed recommendations in many categories.

Therefore, while 70 grams of fat might fall within the *total* fat range for some, it is highly unlikely that it would be a healthy or recommended intake considering the additional negative aspects of such a meal.

"
887,Would Edward II of England have been born without Vikings?,"Edward II of England's ancestry traces back through numerous generations of Anglo-Saxon and Norman rulers.  While the Viking raids and settlements in England had a significant impact on English history and culture, there's no direct genealogical link established connecting Edward II's lineage to Vikings in a way that would prevent his birth.  The impact of the Vikings was more cultural and political than directly impacting the specific lineage leading to Edward II.

891,"Is 2018 Ashland, Oregon population inadequate to be a hypothetical military division?","Explanation:
To determine if Ashland, Oregon's 2018 population is inadequate for a hypothetical military division, we need to consider the typical size of a military division and compare it to Ashland's population.  Military divisions typically consist of tens of thousands of personnel, significantly more than a city of Ashland's size.  Therefore, Ashland's population would be far too small to support a military division.  We would need to know the 2018 population of Ashland, but even a relatively large population for a small city would be insufficient for this purpose.

893,Are aggressive bumblebees suicidal?,"Aggression in bumblebees is a defensive mechanism, not a suicidal tendency.  While a bumblebee might sting as a last resort, stinging is not inherently self-destructive for all bee species; honeybees die after stinging because their stinger is barbed. Bumblebees, however, have smooth stingers and can sting multiple times without dying.  Therefore, their aggressive behavior is not suicidal.

912,Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?,"Here's the reasoning:

To determine if the box office receipts of the 2017 Wonder Woman film covered the cost of a Boeing 737, we need to find data on both.  A quick online search reveals that the box office gross of Wonder Woman (2017) was significantly higher than the cost of a Boeing 737.  A new Boeing 737 typically costs tens of millions of dollars, while Wonder Woman's box office gross was in the hundreds of millions.  Therefore, the box office revenue significantly exceeded the cost of a single plane.

913,Were paparazzi involved in the death of a member of the royal family?,"Explanation:
The death of Princess Diana involved paparazzi.  Paparazzi were pursuing Princess Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Al Fayed, in a car chase shortly before the fatal accident. While the direct cause of the crash was driver error, the paparazzi's pursuit is considered a contributing factor to the accident that resulted in Diana's death.

Answer: {false}
"
916,Do Shivambu practitioners believe ammonia is unhealthy?,"Shivambu practitioners believe in consuming their own urine, a practice based on the belief that urine contains beneficial substances.  Ammonia is a component of urine, and while proponents of Shivambu may claim that the ammonia is processed differently or is beneficial in some way, it's generally accepted that high concentrations of ammonia are toxic to the body.  Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that while they might not express it explicitly, Shivambu practitioners wouldn't consider ammonia *in the high concentrations found in urine* to be healthy.  The potential health benefits they ascribe to urine would not override the inherent toxicity of ammonia.

Answer: {true}
"
917,Is starving Hamas agent eating pig bad?,"The question presents a moral dilemma.  Starvation is a serious issue, and intentionally starving someone is unethical and likely illegal.  The dietary restrictions of Hamas agents are irrelevant to the act of starvation.  The consumption of pork by a starving individual, regardless of their religious or political affiliation, is a secondary concern to the act of denying them sustenance.  Focus should be on the humanitarian crisis of starvation, not the specifics of what food a starving person consumes.

Answer: {false}
"
918,Have the Israelis played the Hammerstein Ballroom?,"To answer this question, we need to determine if there is any record of an Israeli musical act or group performing at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.  A simple online search would suffice to find this information.  While many artists have performed at the Hammerstein Ballroom, determining if any specifically represent Israel would require extensive research beyond the scope of this response.  A definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" answer cannot be confidently provided without that specific research.

923,Would Harvey Milk have approved of Obama?,"Harvey Milk was a pioneering gay rights activist who fought for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.  He was assassinated in 1978. Barack Obama, as president, took significant steps to advance LGBTQ+ rights, including repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" supporting marriage equality, and appointing openly gay individuals to prominent positions within his administration.  Given Milk's activism and Obama's actions supporting the LGBTQ+ community, it's highly probable that Milk would have approved of Obama's policies and stance on LGBTQ+ rights.

Answer: {true}
"
924,Do you have to put on glasses to read a QR code?,"QR codes are essentially a visual pattern that can be read by a camera.  While some people with vision problems might need glasses to clearly see the code and focus on its details for their device's camera to properly scan it, it's not a universal requirement.  Many people can read QR codes perfectly well without glasses.  Therefore, the answer is no.

Answer: {false}
"
925,Did Rumi spend his time in a state of euphoria?,"Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic, is known for his ecstatic poetry that often speaks of divine love and spiritual union.  While it's impossible to definitively state whether he was *always* in a state of euphoria, his writings and the accounts of his life suggest a deep and abiding spiritual joy and ecstatic experiences that were central to his life and work.  He didn't necessarily experience constant, unvarying euphoria, but his life and poetry strongly suggest a significant element of it.


Answer: {true}
"
926,Would dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry be useful if performed on a crab?,"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a technique primarily used to measure bone mineral density in humans.  It works by using X-rays of different energies to differentiate between bone, soft tissue, and fat.  A crab's exoskeleton is primarily chitin, not bone, and its internal structure is vastly different from a human skeleton.  Therefore, DEXA, designed to analyze the density and composition of bone tissue, would not be a useful or meaningful tool for assessing a crab's internal structure or health.  While it *might* produce an image, that image wouldn't provide clinically relevant information about the crab's health or composition.

Answer: {false}
"
927,Would an aerodynamic cactus benefit from more frequently closed stomata?,"Aerodynamic cacti, by their very nature, are designed to minimize wind resistance.  This implies a structure that is likely streamlined and less bulky than a typical cactus.  Stomata are tiny pores on the surface of plants that regulate gas exchange (taking in CO2 for photosynthesis and releasing O2 and water vapor).  Closing stomata reduces water loss through transpiration.

However, keeping stomata closed more frequently would also reduce the intake of carbon dioxide, limiting photosynthesis.  While water conservation is crucial for cacti, particularly in arid environments, photosynthesis is essential for survival and growth.  An aerodynamic cactus, while perhaps needing less water due to its reduced surface area exposed to wind and sun, still needs to photosynthesize.

Therefore, while there might be a slight benefit to more frequent stomata closure for water conservation, the reduction in photosynthetic activity would likely outweigh the advantage.  An optimal strategy for an aerodynamic cactus would involve a balance between minimizing water loss and maximizing carbon dioxide uptake, not necessarily more frequent stomata closure.

Answer: {false}
"
928,Should oysters be avoided by people with ADHD?,"There is no scientific evidence to suggest a direct link between oyster consumption and ADHD symptoms.

"
930,Could every citizen of Samoa send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee?,"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Population of Samoa:**  We need to find the approximate population of Samoa.

**2. Number of JPMorgan Chase Employees:** We need to find the approximate number of JPMorgan Chase employees.

**3. Comparison:** We will compare the population of Samoa to the number of JPMorgan Chase employees to determine if each Samoan citizen could send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee.

Let's find the data:

* A quick search reveals the population of Samoa is roughly 200,000.
*  JPMorgan Chase is one of the world's largest banks, employing hundreds of thousands of people.  A reasonable estimate would be at least 250,000  employees. (This is likely a conservative estimate, and the actual number could be significantly higher).

**Conclusion:**

Since the population of Samoa (around 200,000) is less than a conservative estimate of JPMorgan Chase employees (250,000 or more), it's theoretically possible for every citizen of Samoa to send a letter to a unique JPMorgan Chase employee.

While she didn't directly participate in the development of whole genome sequencing, her contributions to understanding DNA's structure were essential to the advancements that eventually led to it.

Answer: {true}
"
932,Does Kenny G hold the qualifications to be a tax collector?,"To determine if Kenny G holds the qualifications to be a tax collector, we need to consider the requirements for such a position.  These requirements vary significantly depending on the level of government (federal, state, local) and the specific job within tax collection (e.g., auditor, revenue agent).  Generally, tax collector positions require a combination of education (often a bachelor's degree in accounting, finance, or a related field), experience (in accounting, finance, or customer service), and sometimes specific certifications or licenses.  Kenny G is a famous saxophonist, and there's no public information suggesting he possesses the necessary educational background, experience, or certifications to qualify for a tax collector position.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely he meets the qualifications.

Answer: {false}
"
933,Are Sable's a good choice of Mustelidae to weigh down a scale?,"Sables are a species of Mustelidae (weasels).  While they are relatively small compared to some other members of the family, their weight would still be measurable on a scale.  Whether they are a *good* choice depends on the context.  If one needs a small, relatively manageable weight, a sable might suffice. However, if precise weight measurement is needed, other more consistent and controllable weights would be preferable.  Additionally, the temperament of a sable needs to be considered – it would not be practical or ethical to try and weigh a live animal that was struggling against being confined on a scale.

Answer: {true}
"

935,Is Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars associated with the color black?,"Anakin Skywalker, particularly as Darth Vader, is strongly associated with the color black.  His iconic black suit as Darth Vader is a symbol of the dark side of the Force and his fall to evil.  Even before becoming Darth Vader, his costume and lightsaber often incorporate dark colors, reflecting his internal conflicts and eventual descent into darkness.

Answer: {true}
"
936,Was story of Jesus inspired by Egyptian myth?,"Several parallels have been drawn between the life and teachings of Jesus and certain aspects of Egyptian mythology, particularly concerning the mythology surrounding Horus.  These similarities include virgin births (Isis conceiving Horus miraculously), miraculous births (both Horus and Jesus born in humble circumstances but destined for greatness), divine sons (both are considered sons of a god), and suffering and resurrection narratives (Horus's battles against Set and his subsequent triumph mirroring Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection).  However, it's crucial to understand that these are parallels, not direct evidence of inspiration.  The similarities might reflect common archetypes in religious narratives, a shared cultural heritage in the Mediterranean region, or even coincidental overlaps. There's no definitive historical evidence to definitively prove that the story of Jesus was *inspired* by Egyptian myth, though the existence of striking similarities is undeniable. The stories developed in different times and cultural contexts, with differing theological underpinnings.


Answer: {false}
"
937,Is Jennifer Lawrence's middle name similar to the name of a Scorsese collaborator?,"Jennifer Lawrence's middle name is Shrader.  Martin Scorsese frequently collaborated with Thelma Schoonmaker on film editing.  While not exactly the same, the names Shrader and Schoonmaker are phonetically similar.  Therefore, it's reasonable to consider them similar enough to answer in the affirmative.

"
939,Can the Great Depression be treated with Prozac?,"The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s.  It was a period of widespread unemployment, poverty, and economic hardship, caused by a complex interplay of factors including financial speculation, agricultural overproduction, and international trade imbalances.  Prozac, on the other hand, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medication used to treat major depressive disorder and other conditions.  It addresses an individual's mental health and emotional state.  The two are entirely unrelated.  The Great Depression was a macroeconomic phenomenon, while Prozac is a treatment for a micro-level, individual medical condition. Therefore, Prozac cannot be used to ""treat"" the Great Depression.

"
945,Would half muggle wizards fear Lord Voldemort?,"Muggle-born wizards would likely fear Lord Voldemort due to his power and reputation as a dark wizard who killed many people, including muggles.  Half-blood wizards, depending on their upbringing and exposure to the wizarding world and Voldemort's actions, might also fear him. However, not all half-bloods or muggle-born wizards would necessarily be terrified of him. Some might be more brave or defiant, or might not have the same level of knowledge about his power and cruelty. Therefore, it's inaccurate to say *half* would fear him.  A significant portion likely would, but not necessarily exactly half.

Answer: {false}
"
946,Could the endowment of Johns Hopkins University pay off the MBTA debt?,"Here's an explanation to determine if the Johns Hopkins University endowment could pay off the MBTA debt:

To answer this question, we need to find the current value of the Johns Hopkins University endowment and the current amount of the MBTA debt.  These figures fluctuate, so using up-to-date information is crucial.  We would need to search reputable financial news sources for the endowment's current value and official MBTA reports or press releases for the most current debt figures.

Once we have both figures, a simple comparison will determine if the endowment is larger than the debt. If the endowment's value exceeds the MBTA's debt, the answer is yes; otherwise, the answer is no.


Answer: {The answer cannot be determined without access to current, real-time financial data for both the Johns Hopkins University endowment and the MBTA debt.}
"
947,Would East India Company prefer China's modern trade?,"The East India Company was a British company that traded extensively with China during the 18th and 19th centuries.  Their primary interest was in acquiring Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain, which were highly valued in Europe.  However, their trade was heavily constrained by the Qing Dynasty's restrictive policies, which limited trade to specific ports and imposed high tariffs.  The Company was frequently frustrated by these limitations and sought to expand trade beyond the imposed restrictions.  

China's modern trade system is significantly more open and less restrictive than during the East India Company's era.  While there are still regulations and tariffs, the scale and ease of international commerce today would be drastically more appealing to a business like the East India Company.  A company focused on profit would certainly prefer the conditions of modern China's open trade system to the heavily controlled trade environment of the Qing Dynasty.

Answer: {true}
"
948,Is Guitar Hero Beatles inappropriate for a US third grader?,"Explanation:
Guitar Hero: Beatles is a music video game that features songs by the Beatles.  The ESRB rating for Guitar Hero: Beatles is ""E10+"", meaning it is suitable for players aged 10 and up. This rating takes into account the game's content, including the music and gameplay.  While the music itself is generally considered appropriate for children, some songs might contain suggestive themes or lyrics that might not be suitable for all younger players.  However, the game's overall content and gameplay are generally considered appropriate for children aged 10 and older.  A third-grader is typically around 8-9 years old, which falls below the recommended age.

Answer: {true}
"
953,Does The Jungle Book contain racist subtext?,"Rudyard Kipling's *The Jungle Book* is a product of its time, reflecting the prevalent colonial attitudes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  While not explicitly and overtly racist in the way some literature of the period is, it contains elements that can be interpreted as racially problematic.  The portrayal of the animals often utilizes anthropomorphism, assigning human characteristics and societal structures to them.  However, some argue that the ""human"" characters (like Mowgli's human counterparts) are portrayed in a way that suggests a superiority of the jungle animals or of ""natural"" order over human civilization, which arguably reflects a colonial mindset, suggesting superiority of the ""natural"" over ""civilized"" peoples.   Furthermore, the simplistic portrayal of the jungle animals, while charming to children, can be seen as a form of orientalism, flattening complex cultural realities into easily digestible stereotypes.   Whether these elements constitute ""racist subtext"" is open to interpretation, but the potential for such an interpretation certainly exists given the colonial context in which the book was written and the nature of some of its characterizations.

Answer: {true}

955,Is jalapeno heat outclassed by Bhut jolokia?,"The Bhut Jolokia, also known as the ghost pepper, is significantly hotter than a jalapeño pepper.  The Scoville heat units (SHU) are a measurement of the pungency (spiciness or ""heat"") of chili peppers.  Jalapeños typically range from 2,500–8,000 SHU, while Bhut Jolokia peppers can range from 855,000–1,041,427 SHU.  Therefore, the heat of a jalapeño is considerably outclassed by the Bhut Jolokia.

958,Can the Communist Party of the Soviet Union get a perfect all kill?,"The question is asking if the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) could achieve a ""perfect all kill,"" a term typically used in gaming or competitive contexts meaning a complete and utter victory without any losses.  In the context of the CPSU, this would imply complete global domination without any internal or external opposition overcoming them.

This is highly unlikely.  While the CPSU achieved significant power and influence, factors preventing a ""perfect all kill"" include:

* **Internal dissent:** The CPSU itself experienced internal power struggles, purges, and ideological disagreements that undermined its unity and effectiveness.
* **External opposition:**  The Cold War demonstrated the considerable resistance from the United States and its allies, preventing Soviet global hegemony.  Various other nations also resisted Soviet influence.
* **Economic limitations:** The Soviet economic system proved less efficient than capitalist systems, hindering its ability to maintain global dominance.
* **Unforeseen events:**  Political and social upheaval, technological changes, and unexpected events throughout history demonstrate the impossibility of perfectly controlling all outcomes.

Therefore, a ""perfect all kill"" is not realistically achievable for any political entity, including the CPSU.

961,Would students at Marist have to petition to get a rowing team?,"Marist College is a small liberal arts college.  The establishment of a new varsity sport like rowing would require significant resources, including purchasing boats, equipment, coaching staff, and potentially constructing or leasing facilities.  This would necessitate approval from the college administration and likely involve a considerable financial commitment. While students could certainly petition for a rowing team, the college's administration would ultimately decide whether to allocate resources to such a project.  A petition alone wouldn't guarantee the creation of a team.

"
973,Is number of different US President's in 1800s a lucky number in Hong Kong?,"Explanation:

First, we need to determine the number of different US presidents during the 1800s.  The 1800s span from 1801 to 1900.  The first president of the 19th century was Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), and the last was William McKinley (1897-1901).  Counting the presidents during this period, we get a total that exceeds a dozen.  Now we need to consider what constitutes a ""lucky number"" in Hong Kong.  There isn't a universally agreed-upon set of lucky numbers in Hong Kong, but the number 8 is generally considered very lucky due to its similar pronunciation to the word for prosperity.  Other numbers like 6 (similar pronunciation to the word for good luck) and 9 are also sometimes considered lucky.  The precise number of US presidents in the 1800s isn't likely to fall into a commonly understood category of lucky numbers in Hong Kong.

975,Were veterans of the War in Vietnam (1945–46) given free education by the Soviet Union?,"The question asks whether veterans of the Vietnam War (1945-1946) were given free education by the Soviet Union.  The Vietnam War, as widely understood, occurred between 1955 and 1975. The dates given in the question, 1945-1946, refer to the period immediately following the Second World War and before the start of the Vietnam War. There is no evidence to suggest that the Soviet Union offered free education to veterans of a conflict that didn't happen during that time frame. While the Soviet Union did support North Vietnam during the Vietnam War (1955-1975), offering education to veterans of a conflict that occurred before the actual war is unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
977,Did Hanuman ever experience an orgasm?,"Answer: The question of whether Hanuman, a Hindu deity, ever experienced an orgasm is unanswerable based on traditional Hindu texts.  These texts focus on Hanuman's devotion, strength, and service to Rama, not his sexual experiences.  The concept of sexual experience for a deity is not a primary focus in Hindu mythology, and any speculation would be outside the scope of religious texts.  Therefore, there is no basis to definitively confirm or deny this.

978,Do onions have a form that resembles the inside of a tree?,"Onions are layered, with concentric rings forming their structure.  Trees also have a layered structure, with growth rings visible in cross-sections of their trunks.  While not identical, the layered, concentric nature of both an onion and a tree's cross-section creates a visual similarity.

Answer: {true}
"
979,Are LinkedIn and LeafedIn related companies?,"LinkedIn and LeafedIn are not related companies.  LinkedIn is a well-known professional networking site.  LeafedIn (assuming this is a misspelling or a completely different entity) is not a widely recognized company, and there's no evidence of any connection between it and LinkedIn.  The names are similar, leading to potential confusion, but this is coincidental.

Answer: {false}
"
980,Could an ocelot outrun a kindergartner?,"An ocelot is a relatively small wild cat, capable of short bursts of speed, but not known for sustained high speed. A kindergartner, while not particularly fast, can run at a decent pace for short distances.  Therefore, it's unlikely an ocelot would consistently outrun a kindergartner in a race.  The outcome would depend on many factors such as the distance of the race, the terrain, and the specific speeds of both the ocelot and the child. However, it is more probable that a kindergartner could outpace an ocelot given the short distances involved.

Answer: {false}
"
981,Did the population of the Warsaw Ghetto record secret police on cell phones?,"Explanation: Cell phones as we know them did not exist during the time of the Warsaw Ghetto (World War II).  Therefore, the residents could not have used cell phones to record secret police.

"
983,"In the world of Harry Potter, would a snake and skull tattoo be good luck?","In the Harry Potter universe, snakes are associated with Slytherin house and, more broadly, with dark magic.  A skull is a symbol of death.  Neither symbol is typically associated with good luck in the wizarding world.  Therefore, a tattoo combining both would likely be considered unlucky, or at the very least, not auspicious.

Answer: {false}
"
984,Is Alan Alda old enough to have fought in the Vietnam War?,"Alan Alda was born on January 28, 1936.  The Vietnam War lasted from 1955 to 1975.  Therefore, he would have been old enough to have served during a portion of the Vietnam War.

Answer: {true}
"
985,Does title of Van Morrison's most played song apply to a minority of women worldwide?,"Van Morrison's most played song is generally considered to be ""Brown Eyed Girl"".  The title refers to women with brown eyes. While brown eyes are common worldwide, they are not the majority eye color globally.  Therefore, ""Brown Eyed Girl"" applies to a minority of women worldwide.

Answer: {true}
"
986,Did Snoop Dogg refuse to make music with rival gang members?,"Snoop Dogg's career and public persona are deeply intertwined with his affiliation with the Crips gang.  While he has collaborated with numerous artists throughout his career, his loyalties and alliances within the gang structure would likely influence his musical collaborations.  It's plausible that he would avoid collaborating with individuals strongly affiliated with rival gangs due to potential conflict and safety concerns. While definitive proof of a blanket refusal is hard to confirm, the context of his life and gang connections strongly suggests this is likely.

Answer: {true}
"
987,Would Othello be Shakespeare's play to buy Scheherazade most time with king?,"Explanation:
The question asks if Othello is the Shakespeare play that would allow Scheherazade to spend the most time with the king.  This question relies on a misunderstanding or conflation of unrelated stories.

* **Othello:** A Shakespearean tragedy about jealousy and deception.  There's no element of storytelling to delay execution in Othello.
* **Scheherazade:**  The storyteller from *One Thousand and One Nights* (Arabian Nights). She tells the king a story each night, delaying her execution until the stories are complete.

The question attempts to connect these two unrelated narratives.  There's no connection between the length of a performance of *Othello* and Scheherazade's storytelling technique.  Therefore, the premise of the question is fundamentally flawed.

Answer: {false}
"
988,Are goldfish more difficult to care for than isopods?,"Goldfish require a significantly more complex and demanding care routine compared to isopods.  Goldfish need a properly filtered and maintained aquarium with appropriate water parameters (temperature, pH, ammonia levels etc.), regular water changes, and a balanced diet.  Neglecting these aspects can quickly lead to illness and death.

Isopods, on the other hand, are relatively low-maintenance creatures. They require a simple enclosure with suitable substrate and a source of food (decaying matter, etc.), and are generally quite hardy.  They don't require the same level of precise environmental control as goldfish.

Therefore, goldfish are considerably more difficult to care for than isopods.

Answer: {true}
"
989,Did Easy Rider make a profit at the theater when it was released?,"Easy Rider, despite its critical acclaim and cult following, did not make a large profit at the box office upon its initial release.  While it grossed significantly more than its modest budget,  the film's distribution and marketing costs ate into its profits. Ultimately, it was the later home video releases and its enduring legacy that made it a financially successful venture.  Therefore, it did not profit in theaters in the way one might initially assume from its success.

"
991,Do most high school head coaches make as much as the Head Coach at NCSU?,"High school head coaches' salaries vary widely depending on the school district, the sport, the level of success, and the coach's experience.  While some high-profile high school coaches might earn a significant salary, it's highly unlikely that most make as much as the head coach at a major Division I university like North Carolina State University (NCSU).  NCSU's head football coach, for example, commands a salary in the millions of dollars, which is far beyond the typical compensation for most high school coaches.

Answer: {false}
"
992,Has the Indian Ocean garbage patch not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery?,"The Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010.

996,Would George Fox support stoning?,"George Fox was the founder of the Religious Society of Friends, also known as Quakers.  Quakers are known for their pacifism and belief in the inherent worth of all individuals.  Their doctrines strongly emphasize peace and reconciliation, rejecting violence in all its forms.  Stoning is a brutal form of capital punishment, directly contradicting Quaker beliefs.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that George Fox would support stoning.

Answer: {false}
"
997,"Is an inappropriate lullaby Love Song from November 11, 2000?","Explanation: The question asks if ""Love Song"" from November 11, 2000 is an inappropriate lullaby.  To answer this, we need to know if ""Love Song"" is a song with lyrics or content that would be unsuitable for a lullaby.  There is no readily available information to identify a specific song titled ""Love Song"" released on November 11, 2000, let alone its lyrical content.  Without knowing the content of this specific song, it's impossible to determine if it would be an inappropriate lullaby.

1001,Is an internet connection essential for someone using Chrome OS?,"Chrome OS is designed to be heavily reliant on an internet connection.  Many of its core features and functionalities, including access to applications and data storage via Google Drive, depend on a consistent internet connection. While some offline functionality exists, it is limited.  Therefore, an internet connection is essential for a full and effective Chrome OS experience.

Answer: {true}
"
1002,Was Harry Potter a better investment than The Matrix for Warner Bros.?,"To determine which film series was a better investment for Warner Bros., we need to consider box office revenue, production costs, and other revenue streams like merchandise and home video sales.  While precise financial data for both franchises is not publicly available, general knowledge and readily available information suggests that the Harry Potter franchise significantly outperformed The Matrix franchise.

Harry Potter generated billions of dollars in box office revenue across its eight films, alongside vast profits from merchandising, theme parks, and other related ventures.  The Matrix, while commercially successful, had a smaller number of films, and although sequels were successful, they did not reach the same level of global phenomenon status as Harry Potter.

Therefore, based on general knowledge of the immense financial success of the Harry Potter franchise compared to The Matrix, it is highly likely that Harry Potter was a significantly better investment for Warner Bros.

Answer: {true}
"
1003,Is retail a job anybody can be suited for?,"Retail jobs encompass a wide variety of roles, from stocking shelves to managing a store.  While some roles require specific skills or experience, many entry-level positions only require basic skills like communication and the ability to follow instructions.  However, the demands of a retail job—dealing with customers, managing inventory, working under pressure, and adhering to schedules—may not suit everyone's personality or skillset.  Some individuals thrive in this environment, while others find it stressful or unfulfilling.  Therefore, the suitability of a retail job is highly dependent on the individual's personality, skills, and preferences.

Answer: {false}
"
1004,Is a paleo dieter unlikely to color beverages green for St. Patrick's Day?,"A paleo diet typically excludes processed foods and added sugars.  Many green food colorings used in beverages are artificial and contain additives that would not be permitted on a strict paleo diet. Therefore, a person following a paleo diet would be unlikely to use artificial green food coloring to make a drink green for St. Patrick's Day.  They might use natural food colorings, but this is less common and likely not as vibrant a green.

Answer: {true}
"
1005,NATO doesn't recognize double triangle flag countries?,"NATO's recognition of countries is based on their sovereign status and adherence to NATO's principles, not on their flag designs.  The shape of a country's flag is irrelevant to whether or not it is a member of or recognized by NATO.  There is no evidence or policy suggesting NATO's recognition is dependent on a country's flag's design.

"
1008,Has Johns Hopkins University always treated subjects ethically?,"Johns Hopkins University has a history spanning over a century, during which ethical standards and understanding of research ethics have evolved significantly.  While the university is now widely recognized for its commitment to ethical research, there have been instances in its past that raise serious ethical concerns.  Most notably, the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, although not directly conducted *by* Johns Hopkins, involved researchers affiliated with the university and took place in a community where the institution had a significant presence.  This study, which deliberately withheld treatment from African American men with syphilis, is a stark example of unethical research practices.  Therefore, claiming Johns Hopkins has *always* treated subjects ethically would be inaccurate.

Answer: {false}
"
1009,Is University of Pittsburgh easier to enter than FBI?,"The University of Pittsburgh has undergraduate admission requirements, including GPA, test scores (though test-optional policies may exist), and application essays.  The FBI, on the other hand, is a federal law enforcement agency with a highly selective hiring process.  Applicants must meet stringent background checks, physical fitness standards, psychological evaluations, and pass a rigorous training academy.  The difficulty of entry is vastly different; university admission is competitive but focuses on academic achievement, while FBI entry is extremely selective and focused on broader suitability for law enforcement. Therefore, it's significantly easier to gain admission to the University of Pittsburgh than to join the FBI.

Answer: {true}
"

1012,Would a Wolverine and a Lynx be hard to tell apart?,"Both wolverines and lynxes are mustelids with similar builds and habitats, leading to occasional confusion.  However, key differences exist. Wolverines are stockier and have a more rounded head, while lynxes have a more elongated body and a pointed head.  Their fur also differs significantly; wolverines have long, shaggy fur, whereas lynxes have shorter, denser fur.  Their tail lengths vary considerably, with wolverines having very short tails and lynxes having longer, black-tipped tails.  These visual differences, along with their distinct habitats and behavior, usually allow for relatively easy differentiation. While a cursory glance might cause confusion, closer observation reveals distinct features separating them.

"
1015,Can a strawberry get worms similar to dogs?,"Strawberries, like many fruits, can be infested with larvae of various insects.  These larvae are often called ""worms"" colloquially, but they are not the same type of worms that affect dogs (like heartworms or roundworms).  The ""worms"" found in strawberries are typically the larvae of insects like fruit flies or weevils.  These are different species and have different life cycles and modes of infection compared to the parasitic worms that can infect dogs.  Therefore, while the colloquial term ""worm"" might be used for both, the biological reality is significantly different.

Answer: {false}
"
1016,Are Durian fruits an olfactory delight?,"Durian fruit is known for its pungent, strong smell, which is often described as unpleasant or even repulsive by many people.

Answer: {false}
"
1017,Does it seem like the Gorillaz is composed of more members than they have?,"Gorillaz is a virtual band, meaning its members are fictional cartoon characters.  While the core creative team behind Gorillaz is relatively small (Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett primarily), the band's musical collaborations and appearances feature a large number of guest musicians and vocalists.  This gives the impression of a much larger band than the core creative team alone.  Therefore, the statement is true.

1019,Did Richard Wagner compose the theme songs for two television series?,"Richard Wagner was a prolific composer of operas and other classical music, but he is not known to have composed theme songs for television series.  Television as a medium did not exist during his lifetime (he died in 1883). Therefore, it's highly improbable that he composed any theme songs for television shows.

Answer: {false}
"
1020,Do Squidward Tentacles and Alan Greenspan have different musical passions?,"Squidward Tentacles, from Spongebob Squarepants, is depicted as a clarinet player with a passion for classical music and a disdain for popular music.  Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is not known for any particular musical passions or public statements about them.  While we don't have specific information about Greenspan's musical tastes, it's highly unlikely they would align with Squidward's classical focus, given the difference in their fictional and real-world contexts.  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they have different musical passions.

Answer: {true}
"
1021,Is the Louvre's pyramid known for being unbreakable?,"The Louvre's pyramid, while a striking and iconic structure, is not known for being unbreakable.  It's made of glass and metal, materials that are susceptible to damage. While it's designed to be strong and withstand various environmental factors, it's not inherently unbreakable.  There's no evidence or claim suggesting it possesses any extraordinary unbreakable properties.

Answer: {false}
"
1022,Does Evander Holyfield eat pork products?,"Evander Holyfield is a devout Christian.  Many Christian denominations, particularly those with strong Baptist or similar influences, avoid pork consumption due to dietary restrictions outlined in the Old Testament. While not universally adhered to by all Christians, it's a common practice among many.  Therefore, it's plausible that Evander Holyfield, given his religious background, might not eat pork products.  However, without definitive confirmation from a reliable source, it remains a possibility, not a certainty.

Answer: {true}
"
1023,Was England directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict?,"England, as a colonial power and later as part of the United Kingdom, played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of the Middle East that led to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Its involvement includes:

* **The Balfour Declaration (1917):**  This British declaration expressed support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, a territory then under British control. This is widely seen as a key factor fueling the conflict, as it raised hopes for Jewish immigration and settlement while simultaneously causing unrest among the existing Arab Palestinian population.

* **British Mandate over Palestine (1920-1948):** Following World War I, Britain was granted a mandate over Palestine by the League of Nations.  During this period, Britain's policies regarding Jewish immigration and land ownership were controversial and often fueled conflict between Arab and Jewish populations.

* **Post-World War II influence:** The UK's influence and military presence in the region continued to shape the political dynamics after World War II, influencing the partition plan and subsequent events leading to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.


While Britain's direct military involvement in individual conflicts might have been limited at times, its political decisions and actions during the period leading up to and including the establishment of the State of Israel deeply impacted the course of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Therefore, its involvement was not merely peripheral but a crucial contributing factor to the ongoing tensions.

1024,Is accountant a difficult profession for a person suffering from Dyscalculia?,"Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to understand numbers and perform mathematical calculations.  Accountancy is a profession that heavily relies on numerical skills, accuracy, and mathematical calculations.  A person with dyscalculia would likely struggle with many core aspects of accounting, such as balancing accounts, analyzing financial statements, and performing audits. While accommodations could potentially be made, the core demands of the profession would make it exceptionally difficult.

1026,"At Christmastime, do some films remind us that groundhog day is approaching?","Explanation: Christmas and Groundhog Day are separate holidays with distinct dates. Christmas is celebrated on December 25th, while Groundhog Day is celebrated on February 2nd.  There is no connection between the two holidays that would be depicted in films.  Films set around Christmastime would not typically include reminders about Groundhog Day, which is several weeks later.

Answer: {false}
"
1027,Can printing books in kanji instead of the Roman alphabet save trees?,"The question asks whether printing books in kanji instead of the Roman alphabet could save trees.  This depends on several factors, primarily the number of characters needed to convey the same information and the efficiency of the printing process.

Kanji, being logographic (each character represents a word or morpheme), can often convey meaning with fewer characters than the alphabetic Roman script. However, the number of kanji characters in common use is extensive, leading to complex typesetting.  Roman alphabets use fewer characters but may require more characters overall to express the same information.  Furthermore, the actual space saved depends on font size, line spacing, and page layout.  Modern printing methods are relatively efficient, regardless of the script.

While it's *possible* that using kanji could lead to slightly fewer pages (and therefore less paper usage) for certain texts, it's not guaranteed.  The difference is likely to be minimal.  Other factors like the type of paper used, the printing process and the overall length of the book will have a much greater impact on paper consumption. Therefore, it is unlikely that switching to Kanji would result in significant tree saving.

Answer: {false}
"
1028,Do the Egyptian pyramids look the same from outside as they did when new?,"The Egyptian pyramids have undergone significant changes since their construction.  Erosion from wind and sand, along with damage from looting, earthquakes, and human intervention (such as restoration efforts), have altered their appearance.  They would not look exactly the same as they did when newly built.  The casing stones, which originally gave them a smooth, polished surface, are largely gone, leaving the underlying rough stone blocks exposed.

Answer: {false}
"
1029,Can you save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on Samsung Galaxy A10e?,"The Samsung Galaxy A10e has a limited storage capacity.  The exact amount varies depending on the model and whether any additional storage (microSD) is used.  However, even with an SD card, it's extremely unlikely that the total storage would be sufficient to hold all the HD episodes of Game of Thrones. Each HD episode is several gigabytes in size, and the entire series would require tens of gigabytes.  The A10e's storage, even supplemented, would likely be exceeded by this.

Answer: {false}
"
1030,Can Aerosmith legally drive in the carpool lane?,"To determine if Aerosmith can legally drive in the carpool lane, we need to consider the definition of a carpool lane and the number of people required to occupy a vehicle to be eligible.  Carpool lanes, also known as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, generally require a minimum number of occupants in the vehicle to use the lane. This number varies by location and time of day, but it's typically two or more people.

Aerosmith is a band with multiple members.  If all the members of Aerosmith are in the car, they likely meet the minimum occupancy requirement for a carpool lane.  However, if only one or two members are in the car, they would not typically be allowed in a carpool lane.

Therefore, the answer depends on how many members of Aerosmith are in the car at the time.  There isn't enough information provided to make a definitive yes or no statement.

Answer: {false}
"
1031,Can an ostrich fit into the nest of a swallow?,"Ostriches are significantly larger than swallows.  An ostrich egg is already much larger than a swallow, and an adult ostrich is enormously larger than a swallow's nest.  Therefore, an ostrich could not possibly fit into a swallow's nest.

Answer: {false}
"
1032,Can you house a giant squid at Soldier Field?,"Giant squids are massive creatures, growing up to 43 feet long and weighing hundreds of pounds. Soldier Field is a stadium designed for football and other events, not for housing marine animals.  It lacks the necessary deep-water environment, temperature control, and specialized life support systems required for a giant squid to survive.  Even if a suitable tank could somehow be constructed within the stadium, the logistics and expense would be astronomical.

Answer: {false}
"
1033,Would Constitution of the United States paper offend PETA?,"The Constitution of the United States is printed on paper, which is a product derived from trees.  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) advocates for the ethical treatment of animals and opposes deforestation and the use of animal products. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that PETA would find the use of paper, a product that contributes to deforestation, offensive.

Answer: {true}
"
1034,Can a minotaur hypothetically injure a tibia playing football?,"Explanation:
A minotaur, a creature of mythology depicted as having the head of a bull and the body of a man, possesses legs and feet analogous to a human's.  Human tibiae (shin bones) are frequently injured in contact sports like football.  Therefore, a minotaur, if it were a real being participating in football, could hypothetically injure its tibia.

Answer: {true}
"
1035,If it socially acceptable to wear an icon depicting crucifixion?,"The social acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion is highly dependent on context and cultural norms.  In some cultures and religious contexts, particularly within Christianity, a crucifix is a common and accepted symbol of faith and devotion. Wearing a crucifix as a necklace or pendant, for instance, is often seen as a personal expression of religious belief and is not considered controversial.  However, in other contexts, especially secular or non-Christian settings, wearing such an icon might be considered inappropriate, offensive, or even provocative, depending on the specific circumstances and the intentions of the wearer.  The size and style of the depiction also play a role; a small, understated cross might be more acceptable than a large, graphic representation of the crucifixion. Therefore, there isn't a universally accepted answer to whether it is socially acceptable.

Answer: {false}
"
1036,Was United Airlines blameless in worst crash in history?,"The worst crash in history is generally considered to be the Tenerife airport disaster in 1977, which involved two Boeing 747 aircraft colliding on a runway.

Answer: {false}
"
1037,Did Clark Gable appear in any movies scored by John Williams?,"John Williams is a highly acclaimed film composer known for his work on Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and many other films.  Clark Gable was a prominent actor primarily active in the Golden Age of Hollywood (roughly the 1930s and 1940s).  John Williams' career as a composer began much later.  Therefore, it's extremely unlikely that Clark Gable appeared in any films scored by John Williams.

1043,Could common warthog be useful for scrimshaw?,"Scrimshaw is the art of carving images into bone, ivory, or teeth.  Common warthogs have tusks, which are essentially teeth, and these tusks could potentially be used for scrimshaw.  However, the size and shape of a warthog's tusks might not be ideal for intricate carving, and using them would raise ethical concerns regarding conservation and animal welfare.

1044,Would an American feel lost due to language barriers at Disneyland Paris?,"Disneyland Paris is located in France.  The primary language spoken in France is French, which is different from English, the primary language of the United States. While English is spoken to varying degrees at Disneyland Paris (especially in areas frequented by international tourists), an American visitor could still encounter significant language barriers, particularly outside of the main areas of the park.  Therefore, it is plausible that an American could feel lost due to language barriers.

1045,Is it foolish to stand on giraffe's head to see over Eiffel Tower?,"The height of a giraffe is approximately 14-19 feet.  The Eiffel Tower is approximately 1,063 feet tall.  Even standing on a giraffe's head would add negligible height to a person's viewing position relative to the Eiffel Tower's immense height.  Standing on a giraffe's head would also be incredibly dangerous and impractical. Therefore, it is foolish to attempt such a feat.

Answer: {true}

1046,Could a Gladiator's weapon crush a diamond?,"The hardness of a material is measured on the Mohs Hardness Scale, where diamond is a 10, the highest rating.  While a gladiator's weapon (likely iron or steel) might be strong enough to break or shatter many materials,  it would not be able to scratch or crush a diamond.  Diamonds are incredibly hard, much harder than any metal a gladiator would use. The weapon might be damaged in the attempt.

1048,Would someone on antidepressants need to be cautious of some citrus fruits?,"Some antidepressants, particularly those that are metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, can interact with certain components found in grapefruit and other citrus fruits.  Grapefruit juice is known to inhibit CYP3A4, leading to increased levels of the antidepressant in the bloodstream. This can result in higher than intended therapeutic levels, potentially causing side effects or even toxicity.  While not all citrus fruits have the same effect as grapefruit, it's generally advisable for individuals on antidepressants to exercise caution and discuss their diet, including citrus fruit consumption, with their prescribing physician.

Answer: {true}
"
1049,Has numerology helped shape hotel layouts?,"Numerology, the belief in the mystical significance of numbers, has influenced various aspects of design and architecture throughout history. While there's no definitive evidence that numerology has directly shaped *all* hotel layouts, it's plausible that some hotels, particularly those built with specific philosophies or aiming for a certain atmosphere, may have incorporated numerological principles in their design.  For instance, a hotel owner might choose room numbers or floor layouts based on perceived auspicious numbers or patterns, hoping to attract good fortune or create a harmonious environment. However, this would be a matter of individual belief and choice rather than a universally applied design principle. The vast majority of hotel layouts are likely driven by practical considerations such as maximizing space and guest flow.

1050,Would Michael Phelps be good at pearl hunting?,"Michael Phelps is a highly decorated Olympic swimmer known for his exceptional lung capacity and underwater capabilities.  Pearl hunting requires strong swimming skills, breath-holding ability, and the ability to dive to significant depths.  While Phelps's swimming prowess might give him an advantage in some aspects of pearl hunting, it's not guaranteed that he would be *good* at it.  The specific skills needed for pearl hunting also include locating oyster beds, skillfully opening oysters without damaging the pearls, and having the necessary knowledge and experience.  These aren't necessarily skills associated with competitive swimming.

Answer: {false}
"
1051,Would someone pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros?,"Answer:  Yes, it is possible to pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros.  Many businesses in tourist-heavy areas of New York City accept Euros, or other foreign currencies, though they may use an exchange rate that isn't entirely favorable to the customer.  While the US dollar is the primary currency, the prevalence of tourism makes the acceptance of other currencies a practical business decision for some establishments.

Answer: {true}
"
1052,Is the tibia necessary to win the Stanley Cup?,"The tibia is a bone in the lower leg.  Winning the Stanley Cup requires athletic skill and teamwork, but has nothing to do with the presence or absence of a particular bone.  A player could theoretically win the Stanley Cup with a broken tibia (although they'd likely be sidelined for the duration of the playoffs).  Therefore, the tibia is not necessary to win the Stanley Cup.

"
1058,Can a believer in agnosticism become pope?,"Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God is unknown or unknowable.  The Catholic Church requires its Popes to be men of unwavering faith and belief in God.  While an agnostic might hold moral values consistent with Catholic teaching, the core tenet of agnosticism—uncertainty about God's existence—directly contradicts the fundamental requirement of faith within the Catholic Church. Therefore, a believer in agnosticism could not become Pope.

Answer: {false}
"
1059,Do giraffes require special facilities at zoos?,"Giraffes are large animals with specific needs, including tall enclosures to accommodate their height and a diet of browse (leaves and twigs from trees and shrubs).  Standard zoo enclosures may not be suitable for giraffes; they require specialized designs and space to thrive.  Their feeding requirements also necessitate specialized facilities for providing and maintaining their diet.

1061,Did Leonardo da Vinci lack contemporary peers in his home city?,"Leonardo da Vinci was a highly accomplished and exceptionally versatile individual. While he might not have had exact peers in terms of his wide-ranging genius, Florence during the Renaissance was a hub of artistic and intellectual activity.  Many highly skilled artists and thinkers were active in Florence at the same time as da Vinci, although perhaps none matched his breadth of skill and output.  Therefore, while he was undeniably exceptional, it's inaccurate to claim he lacked any contemporary peers.  He existed in a vibrant creative community.


Answer: {false}
"
1062,Do people take laxatives because they enjoy diarrhea?,"People take laxatives to relieve constipation, not because they enjoy diarrhea. Diarrhea is a side effect of laxatives, and it's generally an unpleasant experience.  The purpose of taking a laxative is to promote bowel movements and alleviate the discomfort of constipation.  While some people might misuse laxatives, the primary reason for their use is to address constipation, not to induce diarrhea for enjoyment.

Answer: {false}
"
1063,Did Ice make people rich?,"Explanation:
Vanilla Ice's song ""Ice Ice Baby"" was a significant commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100.  However, while he achieved significant fame and earned money from the song, it's inaccurate to say he made *other* people rich solely because of it.  His success primarily benefited himself and his collaborators directly involved in creating and promoting the song. While related industries like record labels and publishers certainly profited, attributing the wealth of many individuals solely to Ice's success is an overstatement.

"
1066,Is Shakespeare famous because of the infinitive form?,"Shakespeare's fame is not due to his use of the infinitive form.  While his mastery of language is undeniable, and includes skillful use of all grammatical forms, the infinitive is not a defining characteristic that accounts for his widespread and enduring fame. His fame rests on his profound understanding of human nature, his creation of memorable characters, his innovative use of language and dramatic structure, his influence on the English language, and the enduring power and relevance of his plays and sonnets.

Answer: {false}

1068,Did pirates who had scurvy need more Vitamin C?,"Scurvy is caused by a deficiency in Vitamin C.  Pirates were known to suffer from scurvy due to a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables in their diets. Therefore, pirates with scurvy would indeed need more Vitamin C.

Answer: {true}
"
1069,Would a diet of ice eventually kill a person?,"Explanation:
A diet consisting solely of ice would lead to several health problems that could ultimately result in death.  The body needs a balanced intake of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), and water to function properly.  Ice, while containing water, lacks these essential nutrients.  A diet of ice would cause severe malnutrition, leading to deficiencies that severely impact organ function and overall health.  Furthermore, the extremely low temperature of ice could cause hypothermia, which could lead to organ failure and death.  The low caloric content of ice would contribute to extreme weight loss, potentially leading to starvation. Finally, consuming large amounts of ice can damage teeth.

Answer: {true}

"
1072,Is being 5 year Capital One Venture member more cost effective than being in Church of Satan?,"The question compares the cost-effectiveness of two completely unrelated things: a Capital One Venture credit card membership and membership in the Church of Satan.  There's no logical basis for comparison.  The cost of a Capital One Venture card membership depends on spending habits and rewards utilization.  The Church of Satan, while having membership fees, is not primarily about financial transactions.  Therefore, a direct comparison of their ""cost-effectiveness"" is meaningless.

Answer: {false}
"
1073,Is Morocco an ideal location for water skiing?,"Morocco's coastline features diverse geography, including areas with calm waters and others with stronger waves.  However,  it's not widely known as a prime destination for water skiing compared to locations specifically developed for watersports. While some resorts might offer water skiing activities, it's not a defining characteristic of Moroccan tourism.

Answer: {false}
"
1076,Would a sofer be a bad job for a vegan?,"A sofer is a scribe who writes religious texts, specifically Torah scrolls, using a quill and ink.  The traditional inks used in this profession often contain ingredients derived from animals, such as gallnuts (which sometimes need an animal-based binder) or other animal-based components.  Therefore, a vegan would likely find it difficult to participate in the profession due to ethical concerns about the ingredients used in the ink.

"
1079,Could Marco Rubio ride the Candymonium roller coaster at Hershey Park?,"To determine if Marco Rubio could ride the Candymonium roller coaster, we need to know Marco Rubio's height and Candymonium's height restriction.

A quick search reveals that Candymonium's height restriction is 54 inches (4.5 feet).  There's no readily available information on Marco Rubio's exact height. However, a reasonable assumption is that, as an adult male, he is taller than 54 inches.

Therefore, it's highly probable that Marco Rubio meets the height requirement.

"
1080,Were items released from Pandora's box at least two of the names of Four Horsemen?,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are Conquest, War, Famine, and Death.  Pandora's Box, according to Greek myth, released various evils into the world, including diseases, labors, and wars. While the exact contents vary depending on the telling, it's plausible that at least two of the Four Horsemen's evils (e.g., War, Famine, or Death and related evils) were released.  We don't have a definitive list to cross-reference, but the overlap is strong enough to infer a likely ""true"" answer.

Answer: {true}

1081,Did Saint Augustine use the Julian calendar?,"Saint Augustine of Hippo lived from 354 to 430 AD. The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC.  Therefore, during Saint Augustine's lifetime, the Julian calendar was already in use.

Answer: {true}
"
1082,Are parodies of the President of the United States illegal?,"Answer: Parodies of the President of the United States are generally protected under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.  The Supreme Court has consistently held that satirical or critical works, even those targeting public figures like the President, are not subject to legal restrictions unless they meet a very high bar, such as incitement to violence or defamation.  While some specific parodies might be considered offensive or tasteless, this alone doesn't make them illegal.

Answer: {false}
"
1083,Can you go water skiing on Venus?,"Venus's surface temperature is extremely high, around 464°C (867°F).  This intense heat is enough to melt lead.  Water would instantly boil and evaporate.  Furthermore, the atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times that of Earth's, making it incredibly difficult to even stand on the surface, let alone ski on water.  Therefore, water skiing on Venus is impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
1084,Did the Nazis use the Hammer and sickle flag?,"The Nazi party used the swastika as its symbol, not the hammer and sickle. The hammer and sickle is a symbol of communism and socialism, and is associated with the Soviet Union and other communist states.  The Nazi party was a fascist party with a completely different ideology. Therefore, the answer is false.

Answer: {false}
"
1085,Did Paul the Apostle's cause of death violate the tenets of Ahimsa?,"Ahimsa, a principle central to many Indian religions like Jainism and Hinduism, advocates for non-violence and non-injury to all living beings.  Paul the Apostle's death is traditionally reported to have been by execution under the Roman Empire.  This execution would almost certainly have involved violence and therefore would violate the tenets of Ahimsa.

Answer: {true}
"
1086,Could SNL be why Jenny McCarthy does not get along with her cousin?,"There is no public information suggesting a conflict between Jenny McCarthy and a cousin stemming from Saturday Night Live (SNL).  While Jenny McCarthy has had a public career, including appearances on SNL, there's no known connection between this and any family disputes.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that SNL is the reason for any strained relationship with her cousin.

Answer: {false}
"
1087,Is eleventh grade required to get a driver's licence?,"The minimum age to obtain a driver's license varies by state and country, but it's generally not tied directly to a specific grade level.  While many teenagers obtain their licenses around the age of 16 or 17,  which often correlates with being in 10th or 11th grade, it's not a requirement.  Someone could be older or younger than 16 and still get their license, depending on the laws where they live.  Therefore, 11th grade is not required.

Answer: {false}
"
1088,Did DARPA influence Albert Einstein?,"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was founded in 1958.  Albert Einstein died in 1955.  Therefore, DARPA could not have influenced Einstein.

Answer: {false}
"
1089,Does menthol make cigarettes less addictive?,"Menthol cigarettes are not less addictive than non-menthol cigarettes.  In fact, research suggests that menthol may even *increase* addiction.  Menthol masks the harshness of the smoke, making it easier to inhale and potentially leading to deeper inhalation and greater nicotine absorption.  This can make it harder for smokers to quit. The cooling sensation of menthol can also be psychologically rewarding, contributing to the addictive nature of the product.

1091,Would a psychic who admits to hot reading be trustworthy?,"Answer: A psychic who admits to hot reading is not trustworthy. Hot reading is a technique where psychics gather information about their clients before a reading, often subtly, and then present that information as psychic insight.  This is deception, not genuine psychic ability.  A trustworthy psychic would use their claimed abilities without resorting to trickery.

Answer: {false}
"
1092,Can Poland Spring make money in the Sahara?,"Poland Spring water is sourced from natural springs in Maine.  The Sahara Desert is characterized by extreme heat and a lack of consistent water sources.  Transporting and selling bottled water in such a harsh, arid environment would be incredibly expensive and logistically challenging.  Demand would likely be low, due to the readily available (though potentially unsafe) option of desert water sources. Thus, it's highly unlikely Poland Spring could generate a profit in the Sahara.

Answer: {false}
"
1093,Can a jet plane be made without society?,"Explanation:
A jet plane requires a vast amount of specialized knowledge, resources, and coordinated labor to design, manufacture, and maintain.  This level of complexity and cooperation is only possible within a structured society.  The design process necessitates engineers, the manufacturing process requires skilled workers and complex machinery (produced by other societal entities), and the materials used are sourced and processed through societal structures.  Even the basic concepts of aerodynamics and propulsion are built upon scientific knowledge accumulated over centuries within a social context.  Without society's collective knowledge, infrastructure, and division of labor, the creation of a jet plane is practically impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
1097,Do suburbs encourage the use of cars?,"Suburban areas are typically characterized by low population density, widespread single-family homes, and a lack of readily available public transportation.  This spatial arrangement necessitates the use of personal vehicles for commuting to work, shopping, accessing healthcare, and engaging in other daily activities.  The distance between homes and essential services in suburbs makes walking or cycling impractical for many trips. Therefore, car ownership and use are strongly encouraged, if not practically required, by the very design of suburban environments.

Answer: {true}
"
1098,Would someone with back pain enjoy picking strawberries?,"Back pain can make bending and stooping difficult and uncomfortable. Picking strawberries requires significant bending and stooping to reach the berries.

1100,Is Christopher Walken close to achieving EGOT status?,"To achieve EGOT status, a person must win an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award.  Let's examine Christopher Walken's awards:

* **Emmy:** He has won one Primetime Emmy Award.
* **Grammy:** He has not won a Grammy Award.
* **Oscar:** He has won one Academy Award.
* **Tony:** He has won one Tony Award.

Since he is missing a Grammy Award, Christopher Walken is not close to achieving EGOT status.

"
1101,Can you substitute the pins in a bowling alley lane with Dustin Hoffman's Oscars?,"The question asks if Dustin Hoffman's Oscars could substitute the pins in a bowling alley lane.  To answer this, we need to consider the size and weight of standard bowling pins and Dustin Hoffman's Oscars.  Bowling pins are roughly 15 inches tall and weigh around 3.5 pounds.  Oscars are significantly smaller and lighter than bowling pins.  Therefore, they would be unsuitable as replacements.

Answer: {false}
"
1102,Was Rumi's work serialized in a magazine?,"Rumi's work, being poetry and prose from the 13th century, predates the widespread existence of magazines as we know them.  Magazines as a format for serialized publications emerged much later.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely his work was ever serialized in a magazine.

Answer: {false}
"
1103,Would an astrologer focus on the densest terrestrial planet for a Friday horoscope?,"Astrologers consider the positions and influences of celestial bodies, including planets, in their horoscopes.  The density of a planet isn't a factor in astrological interpretations.  Therefore, an astrologer would not prioritize the densest terrestrial planet (Earth) over other planets for a Friday horoscope. The choice of planets considered would be based on astrological principles, not density.

Answer: {false}
"
1104,Can you see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf?,"Stonehenge is located in Wiltshire, England. Dusseldorf is a city in Germany.  The distance between the two locations is approximately 500 miles.  It is therefore impossible to see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf.

1105,Did Brazilian jiu-jitsu Gracie founders have at least a baker's dozen of kids between them?,"The Gracie family, founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, is large.  While precise numbers vary depending on the source and whether you count all descendants or just direct offspring of the initial founders, Carlos Gracie Sr. and his brothers, it's widely reported they had numerous children across multiple generations. A baker's dozen is 13.  It is highly likely that collectively, the brothers had more than 13 children.

Answer: {true}
"
1106,Could a monarch butterfly rule a kingdom?,"Monarch butterflies are insects, not sentient beings capable of ruling a kingdom.  The concept of a monarch butterfly ruling a kingdom is entirely fictional and nonsensical.  They lack the cognitive abilities, social structures, and physical capabilities required to govern a population.

Answer: {false}
"
1107,Does Nicole Kidman despise Roman Josi?,"There is no public information suggesting any interaction, positive or negative, between Nicole Kidman and Roman Josi.  Therefore, there's no basis to conclude that Nicole Kidman despises Roman Josi.  The question is based on a lack of information and assumes a connection where none exists.

"
1108,Do Apollo and Baldur share similar interests?,"Apollo, the Greek god, is associated with many things, including music, poetry, light, healing, and prophecy.  He is often depicted as a handsome, athletic figure.

Baldur, the Norse god, is associated with light, beauty, purity, and joy. He is often depicted as a kind and gentle figure.

While both gods share a connection to light and beauty, their mythologies and roles differ significantly. Their interests are similar in some broad ways (light, beauty), but not in any deeply specific way.   The overlap is superficial.

Answer: {false}
"
1109,Is it wise to feed a Snickers bar to a poodle?,"Snickers bars contain high levels of sugar, fat, and chocolate.  Chocolate is toxic to dogs, and even small amounts can cause serious health problems, including vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and even death.  The high sugar and fat content are also not good for a dog's health and can contribute to obesity and other health issues. Therefore, feeding a Snickers bar to a poodle, or any dog, is extremely unwise and potentially dangerous.

Answer: {false}
"
1110,Would an Olympic athlete be tired out after running a mile?,"Answer: Olympic athletes are highly trained and have exceptional cardiovascular fitness. While running a mile is a significant exertion for the average person, it would likely not be enough to ""tire out"" an Olympic-level runner, especially those specializing in middle-distance or longer races.  They are trained to endure far greater distances and intensities.  However, it depends on the intensity of the mile run. A very fast-paced mile could leave them feeling fatigued, but not necessarily ""tired out"" to the point of complete exhaustion.

1112,Could white rice go rancid before sesame seeds?,"White rice, particularly when stored improperly, can go rancid (develop off-flavors and odors due to oxidation of its oils) relatively quickly compared to sesame seeds.  Sesame seeds have a higher oil content and a longer shelf life, but their oils are more stable and less prone to rancidity than the oils present in white rice.  While both can spoil eventually, the conditions required for white rice to go rancid are more easily met than for sesame seeds, especially under normal storage conditions.

Answer: {true}
"
1113,Would J.K Rowling's top sellers be on a fantasy shelf?,"J.K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter series, which is categorized as fantasy fiction.  Therefore, her top-selling books, the Harry Potter novels, would be found on a fantasy shelf in a bookstore.

1115,Would ISIS agree with Al-Farabi's religious sect?,"Al-Farabi was a Muslim philosopher who advocated for a system of governance based on religious principles, but his views were distinct from the fundamentalist interpretations that ISIS adheres to.  Al-Farabi's approach was more philosophical and less focused on strict literal interpretations of religious texts.  ISIS, on the other hand, relies heavily on specific interpretations of religious texts to justify its actions, which often deviate significantly from mainstream Islamic thought.  Given their drastically different approaches to Islam and their contrasting political ideologies, it's highly unlikely that ISIS would agree with Al-Farabi's religious sect.

Answer: {false}

1117,Is a spice grinder ueseless for the cheapest cinnamon sticks?,"Explanation:
Cheap cinnamon sticks are often thick and woody.  A spice grinder is designed to pulverize spices into a fine powder. While a very powerful grinder *might* be able to handle the tough wood of cheap cinnamon sticks, it would likely be inefficient and could potentially damage the grinder.  It's much easier and more effective to use a knife or other tool to break the sticks into smaller pieces before grinding, or to simply use them whole in recipes that don't require powdered cinnamon.

1118,Would Carolina Reaper decrease sales if added to all US salsa?,"The Carolina Reaper is one of the hottest chili peppers in the world.  Adding it to all US salsa would drastically alter the flavor profile, making it unpalatable to many consumers who prefer milder salsas.  This would likely lead to a significant decrease in salsa sales, as a large portion of the market would be alienated by the extreme heat. While some consumers might enjoy the extra heat, the overall impact on sales would almost certainly be negative due to the vast preference for milder options.

1120,Do some people soak in olive oil and water?,"Some people use a mixture of olive oil and water for various purposes, although it's not a common practice like a bath in pure water.  Olive oil is sometimes used in a bath for its moisturizing properties, and adding water would simply dilute the oil. However, there's no widely known practice or tradition of soaking in a mixture of olive oil and water. While some individuals might experiment with it for personal reasons, it's not a standard practice or treatment.

1126,Could modern Brazilian Navy have hypothetically turned the tide in Battle of Actium?,"The Battle of Actium (31 BC) was a naval battle that decisively ended the Roman Republic.  Octavian's forces, aided by the allied fleets, decisively defeated the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.  The outcome hinged on several factors, including superior naval tactics, superior manpower (in terms of trained and equipped sailors and marines), and the tactical deployment of ships.

The modern Brazilian Navy is a significantly larger and more technologically advanced force than either side possessed at Actium.  They possess sophisticated weaponry, including aircraft, submarines, and modern naval vessels equipped with advanced radar, sonar, and electronic warfare capabilities.   A modern Brazilian fleet would have a distinct advantage in terms of firepower, communications, and overall naval capability.  While the sheer number of ships in the battle of Actium was significant, modern Brazilian naval capabilities would offset this advantage.

Therefore, the hypothetical intervention of a modern Brazilian Navy at Actium would almost certainly have altered the course of the battle, likely in favor of whoever they chose to support.  While it's impossible to say definitively, it's highly probable they could have ""turned the tide.""

Answer: {true}
"
1127,Could Plato have agreed with the beliefs of Jainism?,"Plato's philosophy, particularly his Theory of Forms, emphasizes the existence of a perfect, unchanging realm of ideals that transcends the physical world.  Jainism, on the other hand, focuses on the cyclical nature of existence, karma, and the liberation of the soul through non-violence (ahimsa) and self-discipline. While both philosophies value knowledge and self-improvement, their core tenets differ significantly.  Plato's emphasis on a transcendent, eternal realm contrasts sharply with Jainism's focus on the impermanent and cyclical nature of reality.  Further, Plato's acceptance of a hierarchical society and reliance on reason might not align with Jainism's emphasis on equality, non-violence, and the path of self-realization through meditation and spiritual practice.  The differing views on the nature of reality and the path to liberation make it unlikely that Plato would have wholeheartedly agreed with Jainism's core beliefs.

1129,"Did the Gunpowder plot eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots bloodline?","The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was an attempt to assassinate King James I of England and VI of Scotland, along with the English Parliament.  Mary, Queen of Scots, had already been executed in 1587.  Therefore, the Gunpowder Plot could not have eliminated her bloodline, as that bloodline already existed independently of the plot's targets.  While the plot aimed to significantly alter the course of English and Scottish succession, it did not affect Mary's descendants who were already alive.

Mount Emei is a mountain in Sichuan, China, known for its Buddhist temples and relatively easier, though still challenging, ascent compared to Everest.  While Mount Emei presents its own difficulties, it's significantly less demanding than Everest in terms of altitude, technical climbing skills, and overall risk.  Therefore, it would be unlikely to present a significant challenge for someone with Kami Rita's extensive mountaineering experience.

1136,Was only woman to serve as U.S. Speaker of the House alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor?,"The question asks if the only woman to serve as U.S. Speaker of the House was alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Nancy Pelosi is the only woman to have served as Speaker of the House.  The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred on December 7, 1941. Nancy Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940.  Therefore, she would have been alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

"
1137,Would three commas be sufficient for displaying US 2018 GDP?,"Answer: The US GDP in 2018 was $20.5 trillion.  A trillion is 1,000,000,000,000, requiring 12 zeros, or commas when using the comma system for large numbers.  Three commas would only represent billions, not trillions. Therefore, three commas are insufficient.

1138,Would an expensive tailor use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks?,"High-end tailors prioritize the integrity and longevity of the garment.  Using adhesive to shorten a hem would be considered unprofessional and damaging to the fabric.  A proper alteration would involve removing the existing hem, adjusting the length, and then re-sewing a new hem.  This ensures a clean, durable, and high-quality finish that is consistent with the standards of an expensive tailor.

Answer: {false}
"
1139,Do frogs feel disgust?,"Answer: There's currently no conclusive scientific evidence that frogs experience disgust in the same way humans do.  While frogs exhibit behaviors that might seem analogous to disgust, such as avoiding certain foods or substances, these actions are likely driven by simpler mechanisms like taste aversion or learned avoidance rather than a complex emotional response like disgust.  Disgust, in humans, involves a sophisticated cognitive and emotional appraisal of something as contaminating or repulsive.  We lack the tools to definitively determine the subjective experience of a frog.

Answer: {false}

1140,Is clerk of Supreme Court of Canada safe profession for someone with seismophobia?,"Seismophobia is the fear of earthquakes.  The Supreme Court of Canada is located in Ottawa, Canada, which is situated in a region with a relatively low risk of significant earthquakes compared to other parts of the world. While Ottawa is not entirely earthquake-free, the risk of a damaging earthquake is low. Therefore, the job of a clerk at the Supreme Court of Canada would likely not present a significant risk related to seismophobia.

While they don't specifically sell items *labeled* with late September zodiac signs (Virgo and Libra), they do sell many items that could be used to *represent* those signs.  For example, they sell plants that could be associated with Virgo's earthy nature, or scales that could represent Libra's focus on balance.  However, this is an indirect and interpretive connection.  They don't sell items explicitly marked ""Virgo"" or ""Libra"" in the way they might sell items for Halloween or Christmas.

1143,Could Al Capone have read works from the Harlem Renaissance?,"Al Capone's criminal career spanned roughly from the early 1920s to his imprisonment in 1932.  The Harlem Renaissance flourished during the 1920s and into the early 1930s.  Therefore, there's a significant overlap in the time periods. While there's no direct evidence that Al Capone *did* read works from the Harlem Renaissance, it's entirely possible he could have encountered them.  The Harlem Renaissance produced widely circulated literature and music, and given his wealth and lifestyle, access to such works would not have been improbable.

Answer: {true}
"
1144,Was latest Republican governor of New Jersey as of 2020 heftiest politician ever?,"To answer this question, we need to determine the weight of Chris Christie, the last Republican governor of New Jersey as of 2020, and compare it to the weights of other politicians throughout history.  Information on the weights of politicians is not consistently recorded or publicly available.  While we might be able to find information on Chris Christie's weight through news articles or other public sources, it's impossible to definitively compare that to the weight of every other politician ever, to determine if he was the ""heftiest.""  Therefore, we cannot definitively answer this question.

1145,Would keelhauling be a fair punishment under the Eighth Amendment?,"The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. Keelhauling, a brutal naval punishment involving dragging a person under a ship's keel, is widely considered to be a particularly cruel and inhumane form of torture.  Given its extreme nature and the inherent risk of death or severe injury, keelhauling would almost certainly violate the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment.

"
1152,Is narcissism's origin a rare place to get modern words from?,"The word ""narcissism"" comes from Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Narcissus.  While the myth is ancient, the psychological term ""narcissism"" is a modern word derived from that ancient source.  Therefore, while the origin is ancient, its use as a modern psychological term makes it a somewhat unusual, but not rare, source for modern words.  Many modern words have roots in ancient languages and myths.

"
1153,Is art prioritized in the US education system?,"The US education system's prioritization of art is complex and varies significantly depending on the level (elementary, secondary, higher education), the specific school or district, and available funding. While the arts are often included in curricula, their emphasis fluctuates.  Many schools face budget constraints which often lead to cuts in arts programs, including music, visual arts, and drama.  Furthermore, standardized testing heavily emphasizes math and reading, pushing arts education to a less prominent role in many schools.  While some schools and districts prioritize arts education, and some students may pursue extensive arts programs, it's not a consistently high priority across the entire US education system.  Therefore, a definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" is inaccurate.

Explanation: While Julius Caesar was a highly educated and influential Roman, there's no historical evidence to suggest he read books specifically on pharmacology.  Pharmacology as a formal scientific discipline didn't exist during his time.  Medical knowledge was different, based more on herbal remedies and traditional practices rather than the systematic study of drugs and their effects that defines modern pharmacology.

1162,Would alligator best saltwater crocodile in hypothetical Lake Urmia battle?,"Answer: Saltwater crocodiles are significantly larger and more aggressive than alligators.  A saltwater crocodile's size and power advantage would likely overwhelm an alligator in a fight, even in a hypothetical setting like Lake Urmia.  While the specific environment could have minor effects, the fundamental difference in size and aggression makes a saltwater crocodile the clear victor.

1163,Is the cuisine of Hawaii suitable for a vegan?,"Hawaiian cuisine traditionally incorporates a lot of seafood and meat, such as poi, kalua pig, and poke.  However, many dishes can be adapted or substituted to accommodate a vegan diet.  Plenty of fruits, vegetables, and plant-based starches are used in Hawaiian cooking, providing a base for vegan meals.  While not every dish is inherently vegan-friendly, a vegan can certainly find suitable and delicious options in Hawaiian cuisine.

"
1164,Has Ringo Starr been in a relatively large number of bands?,"Ringo Starr is most famously known for his role as the drummer for the Beatles, one of the most successful and influential bands of all time.  While he has had a solo career and collaborated with other musicians on various projects, his involvement in other ""bands"" in the sense of a formally established, long-term group with significant output is relatively limited compared to his iconic status with the Beatles.  Therefore, while he's participated in musical collaborations, the number of bands he's been significantly involved with is not relatively large.

Answer: {false}
"
1165,Would Achilles dominate Legolas in a hypothetical fight?,"Achilles, a legendary Greek warrior known for his incredible strength, speed, and fighting prowess, would likely dominate Legolas, a skilled elf archer from Middle-earth.  While Legolas is incredibly agile and a superb archer, Achilles's superior close-quarters combat skills, strength, and overall combat experience would give him a decisive advantage.  Legolas's ranged attacks might initially pose a threat, but Achilles's speed and armor would likely allow him to close the distance and overwhelm Legolas in hand-to-hand combat.  Achilles's divine intervention in some accounts also gives him an edge.

Answer: {true}
"
1166,Would someone on a keto diet be able to eat Dosa?,"Dosa is a South Indian crepe made primarily from fermented rice and lentil batter.  The batter is thin and usually cooked on a griddle. While some variations might include added ingredients, the base is predominantly carbohydrate-rich.  A ketogenic diet is very low in carbohydrates, focusing instead on high fat and moderate protein.  Therefore, a traditional dosa would be too high in carbohydrates for someone strictly following a keto diet.

Answer: {false}
"
1167,Did Metallica band members cutting their hair hurt their sales?,"The question asks whether Metallica band members cutting their hair negatively impacted their sales.  To answer this, we need to consider whether their long hair was a significant part of their image and whether a change in that image affected their fanbase or appeal.

Metallica's image in their early years was heavily tied to their long hair, which was a key aspect of the heavy metal aesthetic of the time.  However, throughout their career,  members have cut their hair at various points, some more drastically than others.  It's difficult to definitively link specific sales drops to hair length changes because numerous factors influence album and ticket sales (musical trends, changing tastes, quality of the music, marketing, etc.). While a change in appearance might alienate a small segment of fans, it's unlikely to be the sole determinant of their overall sales success or failure.  Metallica has consistently maintained a large and devoted fanbase even with variations in their appearance.

Answer: {false}
"
1168,Would Quiet from Metal Gear be a poor hypothetical choice for lecturer at Haub?,"Quiet, from Metal Gear Solid V, is a highly skilled sniper and operative, but her expertise lies in stealth, combat, and espionage, not academia.  Her background and skills are not relevant to typical lecturing duties at a university like Haub (assuming this refers to a business school or a similar institution).  Furthermore, her personality is portrayed as reserved, taciturn, and possibly suffering from PTSD, making her an unlikely candidate for effective lecturing and student interaction. Therefore, she would be a poor choice for a lecturer.

Answer: {true}
"
1169,Can a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 hypothetically lift Mount Emei?,"Explanation:
To determine if a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 crane could lift Mount Emei, we need to compare the crane's maximum lifting capacity to the mass of Mount Emei.

The Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 has a maximum lifting capacity.  However, this capacity is significantly less than the mass of a mountain like Mount Emei.  Mount Emei is an enormous geological formation with a volume of billions of cubic meters of rock.  Even considering only the top portion of the mountain, the total mass vastly exceeds the lifting capacity of any crane currently in existence.

Therefore, it's impossible for the Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 to lift Mount Emei.

Answer: {false}
"
1170,Is snoring a sign of good breathing while sleeping?,"Snoring is caused by vibrations in the soft tissues of the throat during sleep.  These vibrations occur when airflow is partially obstructed, indicating that breathing is *not* optimal.  While some snoring might be mild and harmless, it often points to sleep apnea or other sleep disorders that disrupt breathing and oxygen levels throughout the night.  Therefore, snoring is not a sign of good breathing.

Answer: {false}
"
1171,Is calling ABBA the Swedish Beatles a preposterous claim?,"Answer: ABBA's immense global popularity and cultural impact are undeniable, similar to that of the Beatles.  Both bands achieved phenomenal success, leaving a lasting mark on music history. However, to equate them directly as ""the Swedish Beatles"" is an oversimplification.  While they share some similarities in terms of widespread fame and influence, their musical styles, cultural contexts, and individual artistic expressions differ significantly.  Calling ABBA the ""Swedish Beatles"" diminishes the unique qualities of both bands and reduces a complex comparison to a simple label. Therefore, the claim is arguably preposterous due to its inaccuracy and oversimplification.

Answer: {true}
"

"
1173,Is Dungeons and Dragons a game well suited for solo play?,"Dungeons & Dragons, while designed for collaborative gameplay, can be adapted for solo play.  Many resources exist to facilitate solo D&D, including pre-written adventures specifically designed for one player, and rules modifications that allow a single player to control multiple characters or use alternative methods to generate challenges and story developments.  However, the cooperative aspects of the game, such as roleplaying with other players and collaborative problem-solving, are significantly diminished in a solo setting.  Therefore, while it is *possible* to play D&D solo, it is not necessarily *well-suited* for it, depending heavily on player preferences.

Answer: {false}
"
1174,Does a game engine have a fuel injector?,"A game engine is a software system designed for the creation and running of video games.

1176,Could the moon fit inside the Black Sea?,"The Black Sea has a maximum depth of approximately 2,212 meters (7,257 feet).  The moon's diameter is approximately 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles), or 3,474,000 meters.  Since the moon's diameter is far greater than the maximum depth of the Black Sea, the moon could not fit inside the Black Sea.

Answer: {false}
"
1177,Will you see peach blossoms and Andromeda at the same time?,"Peach blossoms bloom in the spring (generally March-April in the Northern Hemisphere, varying by location and cultivar). Andromeda is a constellation visible in the Northern Hemisphere year-round, although its visibility might change throughout the year depending on the time of night and the position of the observer.

Therefore, since the timeframe of peach blossoms and the visibility of Andromeda overlap, it is possible to see both at the same time.

"
1178,Will Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley score same amount of Bacon Number points?,"The Bacon number is a measure of an actor's distance from Kevin Bacon in the ""six degrees of separation"" game.  It's calculated by the shortest path of connections between actors in films.  Two actors share the same Bacon number if they have the same shortest path length to Kevin Bacon. To determine if Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley have the same Bacon number, we need to consult a database of actors and their film collaborations.  Since this requires significant research that I can't perform, I can't definitively say whether they share the same Bacon number.  It's entirely possible, but I need external data to verify.

Answer: {Unknown}
"
1179,Was the tenth Amendment to the Constitution written using Pitman shorthand?,"The tenth amendment to the United States Constitution was written in the late 1700s.

Answer: {false}
"
1180,Did Ivan the Terrible's father and grandfather have nicer nicknames?,"Ivan the Terrible's father was Vasili III, and his grandfather was Ivan III.  Neither of these names are particularly ""nice"" nicknames in the modern sense; they are simply regnal names (names used during their reigns as rulers). While they might have had other names used in more informal settings,  their historical record primarily uses their formal titles. Therefore, we can't definitively say their nicknames were ""nicer"" than Ivan the Terrible's, as we lack that information.

1184,Does the anatomy of a camel lend itself to jokes on Wednesdays?,"The question is a playful one, connecting the physical characteristics of a camel (humps) to the idea of a ""hump day,"" which is often used to refer to Wednesday.  There's no inherent anatomical reason why a camel's anatomy would be *more* relevant to jokes on Wednesdays than any other day, but the pun based on ""hump"" makes it a potential topic for humorous remarks specifically on Wednesdays.

1187,Can you find Depala's race in World of Warcraft?,"Depala is a character in World of Warcraft, and her race is not explicitly stated in the core game materials or official lore.  While she might be described or implied to be a certain race by players or fan communities based on appearances or dialogue, there's no canonical confirmation.  Therefore, the question is unanswerable using only officially provided information.

1188,Are twins always born during the same year?,"Identical twins are formed from a single fertilized egg that splits, while fraternal twins develop from two separate eggs fertilized by two different sperm.  In both cases, the twins develop and are born within a very short time frame of each other, within the same pregnancy.  It's extremely rare for a pregnancy to span across two calendar years. Therefore, twins are virtually always born in the same year.

"
1191,Would a kaffir lime be a good ingredient for making a candle?,"Kaffir lime leaves are known for their strong, citrusy aroma.  This fragrance would be appealing in a candle.  However, the leaves themselves are not typically used directly in candle-making due to their potential for uneven burning and possibly creating soot.  The essential oil extracted from kaffir lime leaves, on the other hand, is commonly used in candle making to impart the desired fragrance. Therefore, while the whole leaf wouldn't be ideal, the essential oil derived from it would be.

Answer: {true}
"
1192,Would it be possible to fit a football field in Alcatraz Island?,"Alcatraz Island is relatively small.  A football field, including end zones, is approximately 360 feet long and 160 feet wide.

Answer: {false}
"
1194,Would a spider wasp be more effective than a bullet ant to stop a criminal?,"The effectiveness of a spider wasp or a bullet ant in stopping a criminal depends entirely on how these insects are deployed, which is highly impractical and unethical.  Neither insect is designed for or capable of reliably subduing a human being.  While a bullet ant's sting is incredibly painful, it's unlikely to incapacitate a determined criminal. Similarly, a spider wasp, while it paralyzes its prey (spiders), wouldn't necessarily have the same effect on a human, and the process would be slow and unreliable.  In short, neither insect is a viable method of crime control.

Answer: {false}
"
1195,Did Disney's second film rip off a prophet story?,"Disney's second film, *Pinocchio*, draws parallels to the story of the biblical prophet Jonah.  Both stories feature a disobedient protagonist who is swallowed by a large creature (a whale for Jonah, a giant sea monster for Pinocchio).  Both protagonists ultimately repent and are spared.  While not a direct ""rip-off"" in the sense of blatant plagiarism, the similarities in plot structure are significant enough to suggest that the *Pinocchio* story may have been inspired by, or at least influenced by, the familiar tale of Jonah.  The thematic parallels of disobedience, divine punishment, and eventual redemption are strong.

Answer: {true}

1197,Could $1 for each 2009 eclipse buy a copy of TIME magazine in 2020?,"Explanation:
To answer this question, we need to consider the cost of a TIME magazine in 2020 and the number of solar eclipses in 2009.  There was one total solar eclipse visible in parts of the world in 2009.  Therefore, $1 for each 2009 eclipse translates to $1.  We need to determine whether $1 was sufficient to buy a copy of TIME magazine in 2020.  The price of a TIME magazine in 2020 would vary depending on the location and retailer. However, it is highly probable that a single copy of TIME magazine cost more than $1 in 2020.

"
1199,Can oysters be preserved without refrigeration?,"Oysters are highly perishable and require refrigeration to maintain their freshness and prevent spoilage.  Without refrigeration, bacteria will rapidly multiply, leading to decomposition and making the oysters unsafe to consume. Traditional preservation methods like canning or smoking require significant processing and heat to eliminate harmful bacteria.  While some techniques might extend the shelf life slightly (like keeping them very cold in ice), they won't prevent spoilage entirely.

1201,Can an emu chase a bogan?,"An emu is a large flightless bird native to Australia.  A bogan is Australian slang for a person considered uncouth, uncultured, or of low social standing.  An emu is capable of running relatively quickly, and while a bogan is not likely to be particularly fast, there's no inherent reason why an emu couldn't chase one.

Answer: {true}
"
1202,"During the Cuban revolution, did the US experience a population boom?","The Cuban Revolution (1953-1959) did not cause a population boom in the United States. While the revolution led to a significant exodus of Cubans to the US, this influx of immigrants would be a relatively small percentage change in the total US population over that period.  The US population was already experiencing considerable growth due to ongoing demographic trends like the post-war baby boom. The Cuban immigrants would add to this growth, but wouldn't be the primary driver of it.  A population boom implies a drastically increased birth rate, which wasn't directly caused by the Cuban revolution.

Answer: {false}
"
1203,Is tobacco use made to seem enjoyable in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"Explanation:
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland does not explicitly depict tobacco use as enjoyable.  While there are references to smoking, particularly the hookah used by the Caterpillar, the portrayal isn't one of pleasure or endorsement.  The Caterpillar's smoking is presented as part of his enigmatic and somewhat unsettling nature, rather than as something appealing.  The overall tone surrounding the scene doesn't suggest tobacco use is positive.

Answer: {false}
"
1204,Can eating grapefruit kill besides allergies or choking?,"Grapefruit interacts with many medications, primarily through the inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), an enzyme in the liver and small intestine that metabolizes many drugs.  This inhibition can lead to increased blood levels of certain medications, potentially causing serious side effects or even toxicity, depending on the medication and the dosage.  This isn't directly ""killing"" in the sense of a singular immediate cause of death, but rather causing a cascade of negative effects that could ultimately lead to death if the medication interactions are severe enough. Therefore, while not a direct cause of death in the way an allergy or choking is, grapefruit's interaction with medications is a significant risk factor that *could* lead to death under certain circumstances.

Answer: {true}
"
1205,Was Kane (wrestler) banned from WCW  headquarters city?,"Kane, a professional wrestler, is known for his career primarily in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), not WCW (World Championship Wrestling).  While he may have had interactions with WCW wrestlers or appeared on events involving crossover talent, there's no record or evidence suggesting he was ever banned from a specific WCW headquarters city.  WCW itself no longer exists as a standalone promotion.

Answer: {false}
"
1206,Is an ammonia fighting cleaner good for pet owners?,"Ammonia is toxic to pets.  Ammonia-fighting cleaners often contain ammonia or release ammonia fumes as they clean, creating a dangerous environment for pets.  Even if the ammonia is ""fighting"" another substance, residual ammonia or fumes can still be harmful if inhaled or ingested by pets. Therefore, ammonia-fighting cleaners are not good for pet owners.

Answer: {false}
"
1207,Would a packed Wembley stadium be likely to have a descendant of the Mongols inside?,"Wembley Stadium has a capacity of around 90,000 people.  The Mongol Empire was vast and its influence spread across a significant portion of Eurasia.  Given the globalized nature of modern society and the considerable passage of time since the Mongol Empire's height, it's highly probable that at least one person in a crowd of 90,000 would have some degree of Mongol ancestry.  The sheer number of people in a packed Wembley Stadium makes it extremely likely that someone with Mongol ancestry would be present.

Answer: {true}
"
1208,Did Holy Saturday 2019 have special significance to pot smokers?,"Holy Saturday is the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.  In 2019, it fell on April 20th.  April 20th is widely recognized as ""4/20,"" a date associated with cannabis culture and celebrating marijuana.  Therefore, Holy Saturday 2019 held special significance for some pot smokers because of the coincidence of dates.

"
1210,Did Brad Peyton need to know about seismology?,"Brad Peyton is a film director known for directing disaster movies, most notably ""San Andreas"" (2015), which features a major earthquake.  A realistic depiction of an earthquake and its effects would require a strong understanding of seismology, the study of earthquakes and seismic waves. While he wouldn't need to be a seismologist himself, consulting with experts in the field would be crucial for the accuracy and believability of his film's depiction of the earthquake's effects. Therefore, a basic understanding of seismology, or at least access to expert knowledge, would have been beneficial for him during the production of ""San Andreas.""

Answer: {true}
"
1211,Would an average American Public University be welcoming to Ku Klux Klan members?,"The Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist hate group with a history of violence and discrimination against minority groups.  American public universities strive to be inclusive and welcoming environments for all students, regardless of race, religion, or background.  However, their commitment to inclusivity would directly conflict with the hateful ideology of the KKK.  While universities legally cannot bar individuals based solely on their affiliations, they certainly would not actively welcome or endorse the presence of a group whose beliefs directly contradict the university's values of diversity and equality.  The university's administration would likely actively work to counter the KKK's presence and messaging on campus.

Answer: {false}
"
1212,Did Teri Hatcher last twice as many episodes on Desperate Housewives as her Superman show?,"Teri Hatcher played Lois Lane in *Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman*, which ran for four seasons (88 episodes).  She played Susan Mayer in *Desperate Housewives*, which ran for eight seasons (180 episodes). 180 is more than twice 88 (88 x 2 = 176). Therefore, she appeared in more than twice as many episodes of *Desperate Housewives* as *Lois & Clark*.

Answer: {true}
"
1213,Did Mickey Mouse appear in a cartoon with Bugs Bunny in 1930?,"Mickey Mouse's first appearance was in 1928, while Bugs Bunny's first appearance was in 1940.  Therefore, a cartoon featuring both characters in 1930 would be impossible.

Answer: {false}

"
1216,Would a Fakir be surprised if they saw a comma in their religious book?,"Fakirs are typically associated with religions like Hinduism and Sufism, where sacred texts are often written in Sanskrit, Arabic, or other languages that use different punctuation systems than modern Western ones.  Commas, as a specific punctuation mark used to separate elements within a sentence, are a relatively recent convention in writing and might not be consistently present in older religious texts or handwritten copies.  Therefore, a Fakir might well be surprised to see a comma in their religious book, depending on the age and style of the text.

Answer: {true}
"
1217,Should a Celiac sufferer avoid spaghetti?,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.  Spaghetti is typically made from wheat, therefore containing gluten.  A person with Celiac disease must avoid gluten to prevent damaging their intestines.

Answer: {true}
"
1218,Is Kobe's famous animal product used in a BLT?,"Kobe beef is a high-grade Japanese beef.  A BLT sandwich contains bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  Bacon is made from cured pork, not beef. Therefore, Kobe beef is not an ingredient in a BLT.

1220,Do skeletons have hair?,"Skeletons are the bone structure of a body.  Hair is not bone; it is a protein filament that grows from follicles in the skin.  While a skeleton might retain some remnants of hair if the body isn't fully decomposed before skeletonization, the hair itself is not part of the skeletal structure.

Answer: {false}
"
1221,Is there a warthog on Broadway?,"Explanation: There is no known production currently running on Broadway that features a warthog as a main character or significant element.

"
1222,Would the Ku Klux Klan welcome Opal Tometi into their group?,"The Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist hate group.  Opal Tometi is a Black woman and a prominent activist and co-founder of Black Lives Matter.  Given the Klan's history of violence and racism against Black people, it is highly improbable, and in fact impossible, that they would welcome her into their group.

"
1223,Is a cory catfish likely to eat another living fish?,"Corydoras catfish are generally peaceful bottom-dwelling fish that primarily feed on sinking foods and detritus. While they may occasionally eat very small invertebrates, they are not known for preying on other fish, especially larger ones.  Their mouth structure and feeding habits are not adapted for catching and consuming other fish.  While a very hungry Cory might nibble at a dead fish, it's highly unlikely to actively hunt and eat a live, healthy fish.

Answer: {false}
"
1224,Would John Muir not likely have a vitamin D deficiency?,"John Muir was a naturalist who spent significant time outdoors, particularly in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Exposure to sunlight is crucial for vitamin D synthesis in the body. Given his lifestyle of extensive time spent outdoors, it's highly improbable he would have suffered from a vitamin D deficiency.

Answer: {false}
"
1225,Would an Orthodox Presbyterian object to 1700s judge's attire?,"Answer: Orthodox Presbyterianism emphasizes a strict adherence to biblical principles and a conservative approach to social issues.  18th-century judicial attire often involved elaborate, ornate clothing and wigs, which could be seen as ostentatious and potentially contrary to a simpler, more modest lifestyle championed by some within the Orthodox Presbyterian tradition.  While not a central tenet, the emphasis on avoiding worldly excess could lead some Orthodox Presbyterians to object to the perceived extravagance of such attire.

Answer: {true}
"
1226,Can you buy furniture and meatballs in the same store?,"IKEA is a well-known furniture store that also sells meatballs and other food items in its restaurants.  Therefore, it's possible to buy both furniture and meatballs in the same store.

1228,Does the art from Family Guy look a lot like the art in American Dad?,"Both Family Guy and American Dad are animated sitcoms created by Seth MacFarlane and share a similar animation style.  While there might be subtle differences in character design and specific animation techniques over the years, the overall aesthetic—character proportions, line weight, color palettes—are quite consistent between the two shows.  This is due to the shows sharing the same studio, creative team, and animation style guides.

Answer: {false}
"
1231,Would a Common warthog starve in a greenhouse?,"A greenhouse, while providing a controlled environment, would not necessarily provide a warthog with the sustenance it needs to survive.  Warthogs are omnivores with a diet consisting of grasses, roots, tubers, insects, and other small animals.  A greenhouse, even a large one, is unlikely to contain the variety and quantity of food sources required for a warthog's survival.  The plants grown in a greenhouse are likely to be cultivated crops and not the natural foraging opportunities a warthog would find in its native habitat.  Therefore, a warthog would likely starve in a greenhouse environment.

Answer: {true}
"
1232,Is the average bulk carrier ideal for transporting bromine at room temperature?,"Bromine is a highly reactive, volatile, and corrosive element.  At room temperature, it exists as a dense, reddish-brown liquid that produces toxic fumes.  These properties necessitate specialized containers for safe transport.  A standard bulk carrier, designed for the transport of dry bulk goods such as grain or ore, is not equipped to handle the hazardous nature of bromine.  The necessary containment systems and safety measures would be significantly more complex and stringent than what a typical bulk carrier provides. Therefore, a bulk carrier would not be ideal for transporting bromine at room temperature.

Answer: {false}
"
1233,Is Bern a poor choice for a xenophobic Swiss citizen to live?,"Bern is the capital city of Switzerland, a country known for its relatively high quality of life and generally welcoming attitude towards foreigners (though certainly with some caveats depending on specific policies at any given time).  A xenophobic person, by definition, dislikes or distrusts foreigners. While Bern might offer a high standard of living, the presence of diverse nationalities and cultures within the city would likely be a source of discomfort for a xenophobic individual. Therefore, Bern would likely be a poor choice of residence for a xenophobic Swiss citizen.

Answer: {true}
"
1234,Are there tearjerkers about United Airlines flights?,"To determine if there are tearjerkers about United Airlines flights, we need to consider whether any widely known stories or films exist that feature a United Airlines flight and evoke strong emotional responses, particularly sadness or empathy.  While there are many stories about air travel that are emotional, a specific tearjerker *centered* on a United Airlines flight is not readily apparent.  Many films and stories feature flight incidents or journeys that lead to emotional responses, but they aren't necessarily specifically tied to United Airlines.  The absence of a widely known, specific tearjerker story associated with United Airlines suggests the answer should be negative.

Answer: {false}

"
1236,Would the yearly precipitation on Snowdon submerge an upright bowling pin?,"Explanation:
To determine if the yearly precipitation on Snowdon would submerge an upright bowling pin, we need to consider the amount of yearly rainfall on Snowdon and the dimensions of a bowling pin.

Snowdon's yearly rainfall is significantly higher than the average for the UK.  Let's assume, for the sake of a generous estimate, that Snowdon receives 3 meters of rainfall per year (this is likely an overestimate but provides a safety margin).  This is equivalent to 300 centimeters.

A standard bowling pin is approximately 38 centimeters tall.

Since 300 centimeters (rainfall) is far greater than 38 centimeters (bowling pin height), the yearly rainfall on Snowdon would easily submerge an upright bowling pin.

Answer: {true}
"
1237,Is Menthol associated with Thanksgiving?,"Menthol is a flavoring agent often found in cigarettes and other tobacco products, as well as in some candies and other consumables.

Therefore, it would not be safe to have a jackfruit thrown at your head.

Answer: {false}
"
1239,Would a honey badger fit inside an oven?,"Honey badgers are relatively small animals, but their size varies.  A typical adult honey badger might be around 2-3 feet long, including the tail.  Ovens vary in size, but most standard ovens are significantly larger than that.  While a very small oven might not accommodate a large honey badger, a standard-sized oven would likely be large enough.

Answer: {true}
"
1240,Would Phineas and Ferb enjoy winter?,"Phineas and Ferb are known for their inventive and adventurous summer activities.  While they haven't explicitly expressed a dislike for winter, their focus and energy are largely tied to the possibilities of long, sunny days.  Their projects often involve water, which is less readily available and usable during winter. The show's setting and tone are distinctly summery.  Therefore, it's unlikely they would enjoy winter to the same extent as summer.

Answer: {false}
"
1241,Do pirates care about vitamin C?,"Scurvy is a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C.  Historically, sailors on long voyages suffered from scurvy because they lacked fresh fruits and vegetables, rich sources of vitamin C. Pirates, being sailors, were also susceptible to scurvy. Therefore, pirates would likely care about vitamin C to avoid getting sick and dying from this disease.

Answer: {true}

"
1243,Did Alfred Hitchcock include internet slang in his films?,"Alfred Hitchcock directed films primarily between the 1920s and 1970s.  Internet slang did not exist during this period.  Therefore, it is impossible for him to have included internet slang in his films.

Answer: {false}
"
1244,Do Republicans reject all forms of welfare?,"The Republican Party's stance on welfare is complex and not a uniform rejection of all forms. While some Republicans advocate for significant cuts to welfare programs, believing they create dependency and inefficiency, others support targeted assistance programs aimed at specific populations or needs.  The party platform generally emphasizes individual responsibility and self-reliance, advocating for reforms that encourage work and reduce government spending.  Therefore, a blanket statement of rejecting *all* forms of welfare is inaccurate.  There is internal disagreement within the party regarding the extent and type of welfare programs deemed acceptable.

Answer: {false}
"
1245,Do citizens of Cheshire sing La Marseillaise?,"Cheshire is a county in England, and La Marseillaise is the national anthem of France.  Citizens of Cheshire would not typically sing La Marseillaise as their national anthem.

"
1246,Would a bodybuilder choose maize over chicken breast for dinner?,"Answer: Bodybuilders prioritize high-protein, low-fat foods for muscle growth and repair. Chicken breast is a lean protein source frequently chosen by bodybuilders. Maize (corn) is lower in protein and higher in carbohydrates compared to chicken breast.  While carbohydrates are important for energy, bodybuilders often focus on optimizing protein intake for muscle building. Therefore, a bodybuilder would likely choose chicken breast over maize for dinner.

Answer: {false}
"
1247,Would a compact disc melt in magma?,"Answer: Magma is molten rock with temperatures ranging from 700 to 1300 degrees Celsius.  Compact discs are made of polycarbonate plastic, which has a melting point significantly lower than the temperature of magma. Therefore, a compact disc would melt in magma.

Answer: {true}
"
1248,Would Alexander Hamilton have known about koalas?,"Alexander Hamilton was a Founding Father of the United States, living from 1755-1804. Koalas are marsupials native to Australia.  European exploration and colonization of Australia did not begin in earnest until the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  It's highly unlikely that any knowledge of koalas would have reached the United States, or Hamilton specifically, during his lifetime.

Answer: {false}
"
1249,Are there options for students who struggle to understand the writing style of Othello?,"Shakespeare's language in Othello presents several challenges for modern students.  The archaic vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and dramatic use of figurative language can create significant barriers to comprehension. To help students struggling with Othello, several options exist:

* **Modern translations and adaptations:**  These versions render the play into contemporary language, making the plot and characters more accessible.  While they lose some of the original poetic beauty, they can be a valuable tool for initial understanding.

* **Annotated editions:**  These editions provide line-by-line explanations of difficult words, phrases, and allusions, clarifying the meaning and context. They often include critical essays and background information on Shakespearean language and the historical setting.

* **Multimedia resources:**  Audio recordings, videos (including film adaptations), and online resources can offer different ways to engage with the text, making it less intimidating.  Seeing the play performed, even in a simplified version, can bring the characters and their motivations to life.

* **Classroom strategies:**  Teachers can employ a variety of pedagogical approaches, such as close reading exercises focusing on specific passages, group discussions to explore themes and character motivations, and creative projects that allow students to express their understanding in different ways (e.g., artwork, presentations, writing).

* **Specialized tutoring or support:**  For students who require additional assistance, individual tutoring or support from learning specialists can provide tailored guidance and address specific areas of difficulty.

"
1254,Would Seroquel be the first treatment recommended by a doctor to someone with depression?,"Seroquel (quetiapine) is an atypical antipsychotic medication. While it's sometimes used off-label to treat depression, particularly in cases of treatment-resistant depression or depression with psychotic features, it's generally not the *first* treatment a doctor would recommend for someone with depression.  First-line treatments typically involve antidepressants like SSRIs, SNRIs, or other types of antidepressants.  Seroquel would likely be considered only after other options have been tried and failed.

Answer: {false}
"
1255,Does the Taco Bell kitchen contain cinnamon?,"Taco Bell's menu includes desserts and drinks that often contain cinnamon.  While the core ingredients of their tacos and burritos wouldn't typically include cinnamon, the presence of cinnamon in their overall kitchen operations (in desserts, drinks, or even as a spice in some limited-time offerings) is highly probable.

Answer: {true}
"
1256,Would a member of the United States Air Force get a discount at Dunkin Donuts?,"The question asks if a member of the United States Air Force would get a discount at Dunkin' Donuts.  Dunkin' Donuts offers discounts to various groups, often through partnerships or specific promotions.  However, there's no publicly available information confirming a consistent, nationwide discount specifically for members of the United States Air Force. While individual stores might offer occasional promotions or discounts to military personnel, this isn't a guaranteed or standard policy.  Therefore, it's unlikely a member of the US Air Force would receive a discount at every Dunkin' Donuts location.

1257,Does Thiago Moises May 13 2020 submission move hypothetically hurt Achilles?,"Thiago Moises's submission move on May 13th, 2020, was a heel hook.  Heel hooks are submissions that target the ankle and leg, specifically focusing on hyperextending the joints. While the Achilles tendon is near the area being targeted, a well-executed heel hook primarily targets the ligaments and joints of the ankle and lower leg.  While there's a potential for indirect strain or injury to the Achilles during a heel hook, it's not the primary target and isn't necessarily injured in the application of the move.

1258,Are quadrupeds represented on Chinese calendar?,"The Chinese zodiac uses 12 animals to represent years in a repeating 12-year cycle.  These animals are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.  While many of these animals are quadrupeds (four-legged), not all of them are.  The snake, for example, is not a quadruped. Therefore, while many quadrupeds *are* represented, not all animals in the Chinese zodiac are quadrupeds.  The question asks if quadrupeds are *represented*, which is true because several are included, but it doesn't ask if *all* the animals are quadrupeds, which is false.

Answer: {true}
"
1259,Would Nancy Pelosi publicly denounce abortion?,"Answer: Nancy Pelosi is a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, which generally supports abortion rights.

"
1260,Can a copy of The Daily Mirror sustain a campfire?,"The Daily Mirror, like most newspapers, is primarily made of paper. Paper is flammable and can be used to start a campfire, especially if it's dry.  Therefore, a copy of The Daily Mirror would likely be sufficient to help start a campfire, though it might not sustain it for a long period on its own.  Additional kindling and fuel would be necessary for a longer-lasting fire.

Answer: {true}
"
1261,Does Ludacris perform classical music?,"Ludacris is a well-known rapper and hip-hop artist.  Classical music is a genre encompassing a wide range of musical styles, but it is generally characterized by its complex structures, formal techniques, and often, its use of orchestral instruments.  Ludacris's musical style is distinctly different from classical music.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely he performs classical music.

Answer: {false}
"
1262,Would Recep Tayyip Erdoğan be unfamiliar with börek?,"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is the President of Turkey. Börek is a very common and popular savory pastry in Turkish cuisine.  It's highly unlikely that the President of Turkey would be unfamiliar with such a staple food.

"
1263,Will a 2 Euro coin float across the Red Sea?,"Answer: The density of a 2 Euro coin is greater than the density of water.  The Red Sea is a body of saltwater, and thus, denser than freshwater. Even though the Red Sea is denser than freshwater, it is still not dense enough to allow a 2 Euro coin to float.  The coin will sink.

Answer: {false}
"
1264,Is white light the absence of color?,"White light is not the absence of color; rather, it is the presence of all colors of the visible spectrum combined.  Newton's prism experiments demonstrated that white light can be separated into its constituent colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), and these colors can be recombined to produce white light.  The absence of color would be black, which is the absence of light.

Answer: {false}
"
1265,Did Isaac's father almost commit similar crime as Marvin Gay Sr.?,"Marvin Gaye Sr. murdered his son, Marvin Gaye Jr.  There is no widely known information suggesting Isaac's father committed a similar crime (murdering his son).  Therefore, the statement is false.

"
1267,Can whole genome sequencing be used for COVID-19?,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful technique that can be used to determine the complete DNA sequence of an organism.  In the context of COVID-19, WGS has been crucial for several reasons:

* **Tracking Variants:** WGS allows scientists to identify and track different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  This is critical for understanding how the virus is evolving, predicting its potential behavior (e.g., transmissibility, severity), and guiding public health responses (e.g., vaccine development, treatment strategies).

* **Tracing Transmission:** By sequencing viral samples from infected individuals, researchers can trace the transmission pathways of the virus, helping to identify outbreaks and control their spread.

* **Diagnostics:** While not a typical diagnostic tool like PCR, WGS can be used to confirm a COVID-19 infection and identify specific viral variants in a sample.  However, it's usually slower and more expensive than other diagnostic methods, so it's not commonly used for routine testing.

* **Drug Resistance:** WGS can help identify mutations that might confer drug resistance to the virus, allowing for the development of targeted therapies.


Therefore, whole genome sequencing *is* used, though not in every situation due to cost and time constraints,  to better understand and combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

"
1269,Would lumberjacks get full after eating three dosa?,"Answer: The question asks whether lumberjacks would get full after eating three dosas.  A dosa is a relatively small, thin crepe-like South Indian dish. While the nutritional content varies based on ingredients, three dosas would likely not be a filling meal for a lumberjack, who is stereotypically associated with physically demanding labor and high caloric needs.  Therefore, it's unlikely three dosas would satiate a lumberjack's hunger.

Answer: {false}
"
1270,Do black swan cygnets typically know both of their genetic parents?,"Black swan cygnets typically have only one known genetic parent, the female.  Black swans are socially monogamous, meaning they form long-term pair bonds.  However, extra-pair copulations (EPCs) are common, and paternity is often uncertain.  Genetic testing would be needed to confirm paternity, and even then it's impossible to be completely certain of the true genetic father without a DNA sample from every possible male in a mating group.  Therefore, it is unlikely that a cygnet would know *both* of its genetic parents.

Answer: {false}
"
1271,Was Moon Jae-in born outside of Khanbaliq?,"Moon Jae-in was born in Geoje, South Korea.  Khanbaliq is the former name for Beijing, China.  Geoje, South Korea is not located in Beijing, China. Therefore, Moon Jae-in was born outside of Khanbaliq.

Answer: {true}
"
1272,Was Kurt Cobain's death indirectly caused by Daniel LeFever?,"Kurt Cobain's death was ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  There is no evidence linking Daniel LeFever to Cobain's death.  While various conspiracy theories exist surrounding Cobain's demise, none involve a person named Daniel LeFever.  Therefore, there is no credible basis to suggest LeFever had any indirect role in Cobain's death.

Answer: {false}
"
1273,Was Florence a Theocracy during Italian Renaissance?,"Florence during the Italian Renaissance was a republic, not a theocracy. While the Catholic Church held significant influence, the city was governed by elected officials and its civic life was largely secular.  Although religious figures and institutions played important roles in Florentine society, the ultimate power rested with the city's government.  Therefore, classifying Florence as a theocracy during the Renaissance would be inaccurate.

Answer: {true}
"
1275,Is Mozambique Drill an easy shot for United States Army Ranger?,"Mozambique Drill is a shooting technique, not a specific target.  Its effectiveness depends heavily on the shooter's skill, the circumstances (range, cover, enemy reaction), and the type of weapon used.  A highly trained US Army Ranger would likely be proficient with the Mozambique Drill, making it a relatively easy shot for them *given ideal conditions*. However, combat situations are rarely ideal.  The difficulty is variable and not inherently ""easy"" or ""hard"" regardless of the shooter's skill.

Answer: {false}
"
1276,Is a construction worker required to build a portfolio?,"Construction workers typically don't build portfolios in the same way that, for example, architects or graphic designers do.  While they might keep records of projects they've worked on, this is usually for their own reference or for tax purposes, not as a curated collection of work samples to showcase their skills to potential clients.  A resume outlining their experience and skills is far more common.

"
1278,"Did the founders of the biggest city in Orange County, California speak Italian?","The largest city in Orange County, California is Anaheim.  Anaheim's founding is complex and doesn't involve a single group of founders speaking a single language.  While the area was initially inhabited by Tongva people, the modern city's origins trace back to the establishment of a colony by German settlers in the mid-19th century. Subsequently,  the area developed with diverse populations, including people of various nationalities and linguistic backgrounds. Therefore, it's inaccurate to say the founders spoke Italian.


Answer: {false}
"
1279,Were French people involved in the American Civil War?,"The American Civil War (1861-1865) involved combatants from various nations, though primarily those within North America.  While not on the scale of the participation of Britain, France had a complex relationship with the Confederacy and the Union.  France officially maintained neutrality, but there were some individual French citizens who joined the fighting on both sides, likely as mercenaries or volunteers. Additionally, some French citizens may have provided financial or material support to either the Confederacy or the Union, though these contributions wouldn't equate to official French involvement in the war.

Answer: {true}
"
1280,Did the Royal Air Force fight in the Boxer Rebellion?,"The Boxer Rebellion took place in China from 1899 to 1901.  The Royal Air Force (RAF) was not formed until 1918. Therefore, the RAF could not have participated in the Boxer Rebellion.

Answer: {false}
"
1281,Is Elijah part of a Jewish holiday?,"Elijah is a significant prophet in Judaism and is associated with several Jewish holidays, most notably Hanukkah.  The story of Hanukkah involves a miracle of oil lasting eight nights, and Elijah is traditionally believed to be associated with bringing miraculous fire and light.  While not directly the *subject* of the holiday in the same way that Moses is for Passover, Elijah's presence and role in Jewish tradition connect him strongly to the celebrations surrounding Hanukkah. Therefore, he is considered part of a Jewish holiday.

Answer: {true}
"
1282,Was the Peak of the Andes hidden from the view of the Colossus of Rhodes?,"The Colossus of Rhodes was a gigantic bronze statue of the Greek sun god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes on the island of Rhodes, in Greece.  The Andes Mountains are located in South America.  The distance between Rhodes and the Andes is vast, making it geographically impossible for the Colossus of Rhodes to have obstructed a view of the Andes, even if the Colossus were still standing.

Therefore, regardless of George Soros's net worth, he could not purchase it.

Answer: {false}
"
1284,Would Communist Party of the Soviet Union hypothetically support Trickle Down Economics?,"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was fundamentally opposed to capitalist principles. Trickle-down economics is a theory that argues economic growth benefits everyone in society, as wealth ""trickles down"" from the rich to the poor. This theory is inherently tied to capitalist ideology and free-market principles.  The CPSU advocated for a centrally planned economy and the abolition of private property, directly contradicting the core tenets of trickle-down economics. Therefore, it's highly improbable that the CPSU would support such an economic theory.

Answer: {false}
"

"
1287,Could Eddie Murphy's children hypothetically fill a basketball court by themselves?,"Answer: Eddie Murphy has 10 children.  A basketball court's dimensions vary, but let's assume a standard court size that could comfortably fit 10 people standing shoulder to shoulder without significant overlap.  It's unlikely that 10 children, even larger ones, could completely fill a basketball court by themselves in a way that prevents any part of the court from being visibly empty.  While they might occupy a significant portion, the space wouldn't be entirely filled.

Answer: {false}
"
1288,Could a white cockatoo have lived through the entire Thirty Years' War?,"The Thirty Years' War lasted from 1618 to 1648.  A cockatoo's lifespan varies by species, but generally ranges from 30 to 60 years.  Even the longest-lived cockatoo species would not have a lifespan covering the entire 30-year duration of the war.

Answer: {false}
"
1289,Would a house full of aloe vera hypothetically be ideal for Unsinkable Sam?,"Unsinkable Sam was a cat who survived several ship sinkings during World War II.  Aloe vera is a plant known for its soothing properties, often used on burns and wounds.  While aloe vera could potentially soothe minor scrapes or irritations, it wouldn't provide protection against the dangers faced by a cat surviving ship sinkings (e.g., drowning, exposure to the elements, injuries from explosions or falling debris). Therefore, a house full of aloe vera would not be ideal for Unsinkable Sam's survival needs.

1291,Can a New Yorker get their eyes checked by Rand Paul legally?,"Explanation:
Rand Paul is a United States Senator and ophthalmologist.  Being a medical doctor, he is legally licensed to practice medicine.  However, the question asks if a New Yorker could legally get their eyes checked *by* him.  This implies that Rand Paul would need to be practicing ophthalmology in New York, which requires a New York state medical license. While he is a licensed physician, there's no information provided to confirm he holds a New York state license.  Therefore, it's not guaranteed that a New Yorker could legally get their eyes checked by Rand Paul.

Answer: {false}
"
1292,Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition?,"Cheb Mami is a Rai singer from Algeria.  The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for achievements in journalism, literature, and music composition in the United States. While the Pulitzer Prize for Music has been awarded to composers of various musical styles, it is highly unlikely to be awarded to a Rai singer who is not a US citizen and whose work is primarily outside the scope of American musical composition.  The selection criteria and focus of the Pulitzer Prize strongly suggest that his genre and geographic location make it highly improbable for him to win.

Michael Scott, Steve Carell's character on *The Office*, is consistently portrayed as a deeply flawed and incompetent manager.  While he believes himself to be a great leader, his actions repeatedly demonstrate a lack of understanding of proper management techniques, including poor decision-making, inappropriate behavior, and a general disregard for the well-being and professional development of his employees. His leadership style is often described as chaotic, insensitive, and even offensive.  Therefore, he is not portrayed as possessing tremendous leadership skills.

1299,Would a customer be happy if their grocery store meat tasted like game?,"The answer depends on the customer's preferences.  Some people enjoy the taste of game meat, while others strongly dislike it.  If a customer expects the usual taste of commercially raised meat and receives something that tastes like game, they are likely to be unhappy.  Conversely, a customer who enjoys game meat might be pleased.  Since we cannot know the customer's preferences, we cannot definitively say whether they would be happy or not.

While some characters might have spent time on porches occasionally, it wasn't a defining characteristic of any particular individual.

Answer: {false}
"
1303,Is shrimp scampi definitely free of plastic?,"Shrimp scampi is a dish made with shrimp, butter, garlic, and white wine.  While the shrimp itself is unlikely to contain plastic, there is a possibility of plastic contamination from several sources:

* **Fishing gear:**  Fishing nets and other gear can contain microplastics, which can become embedded in shrimp.  
* **Packaging:**  If the shrimp is packaged in plastic, there is a risk of plastic particles transferring to the food.
* **Ingredients:**  While less likely, other ingredients like butter or wine could be processed or transported using plastic containers, potentially leading to contamination.
* **Preparation:**  Plastic utensils or containers used during preparation could introduce plastic.

Therefore, there's no guarantee that shrimp scampi is completely free of plastic.  The level of contamination would vary depending on various factors such as sourcing, packaging and preparation methods.

Answer: {false}
"
1304,Have rhinoceroses been killed to improve human sex lives?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation: There is no evidence to support the claim that rhinoceroses have been killed to improve human sex lives.  While rhinoceros horn has been used in traditional Asian medicine, the purported aphrodisiac qualities are not supported by scientific evidence.  The use of rhino horn is driven by cultural beliefs and has led to the near extinction of several rhinoceros species due to poaching.  The claim links rhino horn to improved sexual function is a false claim that perpetuates harmful practices.
"
1305,Would three newborn kittens fit on a standard Amtrak coach seat?,"A standard Amtrak coach seat is approximately 17 inches wide.  Three newborn kittens are very small, each likely less than 6 inches long and a few inches wide. While three kittens might fit *lengthwise* on a seat, they wouldn't fit comfortably and could easily fall off.  The more important factor is that it's unlikely three kittens could comfortably fit *side-by-side* across the 17-inch seat.  They would likely need more space to move around and be secure.

Answer: {false}
"
1306,Can the Persian Gulf fit in New Jersey?,"The Persian Gulf's approximate area is 97,000 square miles.  New Jersey's area is approximately 8,721 square miles.  The Persian Gulf is significantly larger than New Jersey. Therefore, the Persian Gulf cannot fit inside New Jersey.

1308,Do Jews believe in any New Testament angels?,"Judaism does not accept the New Testament as scripture.  The New Testament contains accounts of angels not found in Jewish scripture (the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh).  Therefore, Jews would not believe in the New Testament's angels in the same way Christians do, as they do not consider those texts authoritative.  While Jewish tradition does recognize angels, these are based solely on their own scriptures and traditions.

Answer: {false}
"
1309,Does the actress who played Elizabeth II speak fluent Arabic?,"The question asks whether the actress who played Queen Elizabeth II speaks fluent Arabic.

There is no widely available information indicating that Olivia Colman speaks fluent Arabic.

Answer: {false}
"
1310,Can Kane challenge Joe Biden in this year's primaries?,"Explanation:

The 2024 US Presidential election primaries are underway.  To challenge Joe Biden in the Democratic primaries, a candidate would need to meet several requirements, including gathering enough signatures to be on the ballot in various states, and securing sufficient delegate support.  Kane, lacking any substantial political history or public campaign, would be highly unlikely to meet these requirements and effectively challenge an incumbent president like Joe Biden within the extremely short timeframe remaining before the primaries are concluded.

Answer: {false}
"
1311,Could  jockey win Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endpoints?,"The Triple Crown consists of three horse races: the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes.  To win the Triple Crown, a horse must win all three races.  Eid al-Fitr is a holiday with variable dates based on the lunar calendar.  We need to know the specific years' dates for Eid al-Fitr to determine if a horse could win the Triple Crown between those endpoints. The dates of the Triple Crown races are fixed, usually in May and June. If the Eid al-Fitr dates encompass the timeframe of the Triple Crown races, then it's theoretically possible for a jockey to win the Triple Crown during that period.  However, it's not guaranteed.  The question is somewhat ambiguous.

Given Vick's involvement in dog fighting, it's highly likely he would be on a hypothetical blacklist maintained by PETA.

Answer: {true}
"
1315,Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?,"Explanation:

Ten gallons of seawater weighs approximately 83 pounds (1 gallon of seawater weighs approximately 8.34 pounds).  While 83 pounds is a significant weight, it is unlikely to crush a six-year-old child.  The pressure would be distributed across the child's body, and a human body is remarkably resilient to pressure of this magnitude.  The child might be uncomfortable or immobilized under the weight, but crushing is highly improbable.


Answer: {false}
"
1316,Does someone from Japan need a passport to go to a Nordic country?,"To travel internationally, citizens generally require a passport from their home country.

1318,Is Freya a combination of Athena and Aphrodite?,"The question asks if Freya is a combination of Athena and Aphrodite.  Freya is a Norse goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, war, and death.  Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts. Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. While Freya shares some attributes with both Aphrodite (love and beauty) and Athena (warfare), she is a distinct Norse goddess with her own mythology and characteristics.  She is not a direct combination or fusion of the two Greek goddesses.

"
1319,Did Jack Dempsey have most title fight wins in either of his weight classes?,"Jack Dempsey held the world heavyweight title for seven years, from 1919 to 1926.  While he had many successful title defenses,  to determine if he had *most* title fight wins requires comparing his record to other heavyweight champions.  A simple check of boxing records would show whether or not his number of successful title defenses was the highest in heavyweight history.  Without that comparative data, it's impossible to definitively answer the question.

Answer: {false}
"
1320,Could you watch a new Seinfeld episode every day for a year?,"Explanation: There are 365 days in a year.  To watch a new Seinfeld episode every day for a year, there would need to be at least 365 episodes of Seinfeld.  The show ran for 9 seasons with approximately 20 episodes per season.  This means there are approximately 180 episodes (9 x 20).  There are not enough Seinfeld episodes to watch a new one each day for an entire year.

1323,Was being a mail carrier considered one of the most dangerous jobs?,"The question asks whether being a mail carrier was considered one of the most dangerous jobs.  While the job of a mail carrier inherently involves some risk (exposure to the elements, interacting with strangers, potential for accidents while driving or walking), it's not typically ranked among the most dangerous professions.  Occupations with significantly higher rates of injury and fatality, such as logging, fishing, and mining, consistently top such lists.  While mail carriers might face risks of assaults or dog bites, these risks are generally lower compared to the inherent dangers in other occupations.

Answer: {false}

1326,"If you bottle your own milk, would there be cream on top of it?","Explanation:
When milk is bottled commercially, it undergoes homogenization. This process breaks down the fat globules in the milk, preventing them from separating and rising to the top to form cream.  If you bottle your own milk without homogenization, the cream, which is the fattier portion of the milk, will naturally separate and rise to the top.

1331,Did Switzerland support the United States in the Spanish–American War?,"Switzerland, being a neutral country, did not officially support either side in the Spanish-American War.  While Switzerland may have had trade relations with both Spain and the United States, this would not constitute support for either belligerent in the conflict.  Switzerland maintains a policy of neutrality and avoids direct involvement in international wars.

"
1335,Are tampons a good 24 hour solution for mentruation?,"Tampons are designed to absorb menstrual blood, but they are not intended for 24-hour continuous use.  Leaving a tampon in for an extended period, such as 24 hours, significantly increases the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a serious and potentially life-threatening bacterial infection.  Medical guidelines recommend changing tampons every 4-8 hours, depending on flow.  Therefore, tampons are not a good 24-hour solution for menstruation.

Answer: {false}
"
1336,Are all characters in Legend of Robin Hood fictional?,"The Legend of Robin Hood features Robin Hood, Maid Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, and Sheriff of Nottingham. While Robin Hood is a legendary figure with some basis in historical figures, the story is largely a fictionalized account, and the characters of Maid Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, and the Sheriff of Nottingham are fictional creations added to the legend over time.  Therefore, not all characters are based on real historical figures.

1339,Did Nine Inch Nails inspire Aretha Franklin's sound?,"Nine Inch Nails is a rock band known for its industrial and alternative metal sound, characterized by heavy guitar riffs, electronic elements, and often dark and aggressive lyrical themes.  Aretha Franklin, on the other hand, is a legendary soul and R&B singer known for her powerful vocals, gospel influences, and soulful interpretations of classic songs.  Their musical styles are vastly different.  There's no evidence to suggest Nine Inch Nails had any influence on Aretha Franklin's sound, or vice versa.

"
1342,"In American society, will a bachelor's degree often include a leap year?","A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of 365.  The inclusion of a leap year has nothing to do with a bachelor's degree or its duration of study.  A bachelor's degree program typically takes four years to complete, regardless of whether or not those four years include a leap year.  The length of the degree program is determined by the curriculum and the university's requirements, not the calendar.

1343,Did children read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone during the Albanian Civil War?,"The Albanian Civil War lasted from 1997 to 1999.  ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" was published in the UK in 1997 and the US in 1998.  Therefore, it's highly probable that children in Albania would have had access to the book during or after the conflict, although the extent of access would depend on availability and other factors like literacy rates and the disruption caused by the war.

Answer: {false}
"
1345,Would it be wise to bring a robusto into Central Park Zoo?,"Bringing a robusto, which is a type of cigar, into Central Park Zoo would likely violate the zoo's rules and regulations.  Zoos generally prohibit smoking within their enclosures to protect animal and human health, and to prevent fire hazards. The smoke could irritate animals' respiratory systems, and the smell could be unpleasant for visitors.  Furthermore, discarding the cigar butt improperly could pollute the environment.  Therefore, it's highly unwise to bring a robusto into Central Park Zoo.

Answer: {false}

"
1348,Is Benjamin Franklin a prime candidate to have his statues removed by Black Lives Matter movement?,"Benjamin Franklin's legacy is complex and includes actions that are problematic from a modern perspective.  While he is celebrated as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he also owned slaves and engaged in actions that were exploitative of marginalized communities.  The Black Lives Matter movement focuses on racial justice and dismantling systems of oppression. Given Franklin's slave ownership and other actions that contradict the values of racial equality,  his statues could be viewed as symbols of a problematic past and therefore targets for removal.  The removal of statues of historical figures with problematic pasts has been a key aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement, as demonstrated by the calls to remove statues of Christopher Columbus.

Answer: {true}
"
1349,Would Jason Voorhees hypothetically fail at being a martyr?,"Jason Voorhees, the fictional killer from the Friday the 13th franchise, is characterized by his relentless pursuit of violence and murder.  A martyr, by definition, sacrifices themselves for a cause or belief. Jason's actions are driven by rage and revenge, not by a selfless devotion to any ideology or higher purpose.  His continued survival and murderous spree directly contradict the core tenets of martyrdom.  Therefore, he would fail spectacularly at being a martyr.

Answer: {false}
"
1350,Would a teacher still have their job if they called a black student an ape?,"Answer: A teacher calling a Black student an ape is incredibly racist and constitutes egregious misconduct.  Such an action would almost certainly violate the teacher's contract, school policies, and possibly even local and/or federal anti-discrimination laws.  The overwhelming likelihood is that the teacher would face disciplinary action, ranging from suspension to termination of employment.  Therefore, the teacher would likely lose their job.

Answer: {false}
"
1351,Would Eye surgery on a fly be in vain?,"Answer: Flies have compound eyes, which are fundamentally different in structure and function from human eyes.  Eye surgery techniques developed for humans would be entirely inappropriate and ineffective for a fly's eyes.  The delicate structures and vastly different physiology would make any attempt at human-style eye surgery futile.  Therefore, the surgery would be in vain.

Answer: {true}
"
1352,Are rainbows devoid of color made by mixing yin and yang colors?,"Rainbows are formed by the refraction and dispersion of sunlight through water droplets.  The colors we see are the wavelengths of visible light separated by this process.  Yin and yang are philosophical concepts from Taoism representing opposing forces in balance, not colors.  Therefore, the premise that rainbows are devoid of color and created by mixing yin and yang colors is incorrect.

Answer: {false}
"
1353,Did mongoose come from later period than rhinos?,"To determine if mongooses came from a later period than rhinos, we need to consider their evolutionary history.  Rhinos belong to the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals with odd-toed ungulates that originated many millions of years ago.  Mongooses belong to the family Herpestidae, within the order Carnivora.  While the exact dates of the origin of both groups are subject to ongoing research and refinement, the fossil record shows that perissodactyls, including rhinos, have a considerably longer evolutionary history than carnivores like mongooses.  Therefore, rhinos appeared earlier in evolutionary time.

"
1356,Is Bill Gates the wealthiest of the Baby Boomers?,"To determine if Bill Gates is the wealthiest Baby Boomer, we need to consider the wealth of other prominent Baby Boomers.  While Bill Gates's net worth is substantial, other Baby Boomers like Mark Zuckerberg (though technically a Gen X-er, he's close in age and often grouped with Boomers in wealth discussions), Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett also possess immense fortunes.  There's no single definitive, constantly updated list that definitively ranks the wealthiest Baby Boomers in real-time due to fluctuating market values.  While Bill Gates is likely among the top contenders, definitively stating him as *the* wealthiest requires constantly updated information that goes beyond the scope of this immediate response. Therefore, a conclusive answer cannot be provided without accessing constantly updated real-time net worth data.

Answer: {false}
"
1357,Do Windows or Android smartphones run newer versions of Linux?,"Explanation:
Neither Windows nor Android smartphones run newer versions of Linux.  While Android is based on the Linux kernel, it is a significantly modified version and not a standard Linux distribution.

"
1359,Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?,"Genghis Khan's vast empire and prolific descendants resulted in a significantly larger number of people sharing his Y-chromosome compared to Julius Caesar.  While there are many descendants of Julius Caesar, his lineage has been significantly diluted over the centuries through multiple generations and branches of his family tree.  Genghis Khan, on the other hand, fathered numerous children with many wives and concubines across a large geographical area, leading to an extensive genetic spread of his Y-chromosome.  Multiple genetic studies have shown a surprising number of men in Central Asia share his Y-chromosome.

1361,Do some psychotherapy patients have no mental illness?,"Psychotherapy is a form of treatment that helps individuals address various mental and emotional challenges. While many people who seek psychotherapy have diagnosable mental illnesses, it's not a requirement.  Some individuals might seek therapy to cope with significant life stressors, improve their coping mechanisms, enhance personal growth, or navigate relationship issues, even without meeting the criteria for a specific mental disorder.  Therefore, some psychotherapy patients may not have a diagnosable mental illness.

Answer: {true}
"
1362,Can an art dealer buy Boeing 737-800 with a Da Vinci painting?,"To answer this question, we need to consider the value of a Da Vinci painting and the cost of a Boeing 737-800.

Da Vinci paintings are among the most valuable works of art in the world.  Even a less famous Da Vinci painting would likely sell for hundreds of millions of dollars.  A major work could fetch over a billion dollars.

The list price of a Boeing 737-800 is in the tens of millions of dollars.  However, this does not include potential add-ons, configurations, and other associated costs, potentially bringing the total closer to $100 million.

Therefore, even a relatively modestly valued Da Vinci painting would easily exceed the cost of a Boeing 737-800.  An art dealer could certainly use the proceeds from the sale of a Da Vinci painting to purchase a Boeing 737-800.

Answer: {true}

1363,"Was the British car, the Mini, the first car manufactured?","The first car is generally considered to be the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, built by Karl Benz in 1886.  The Mini was first manufactured in 1959. Therefore, the Mini was not the first car manufactured.

Answer: {false}
"
1364,Would early Eastern Canadian Natives language have use of the letter B?,"Early Eastern Canadian Indigenous languages, such as Algonquian and Iroquoian languages,  predate the adoption of the Latin alphabet.  The Latin alphabet, with its letter ""B,"" is a later development imposed through colonization.  Therefore, these languages did not originally utilize the letter ""B"" or any letter from the Latin alphabet in their writing systems.  Their sounds were represented through different methods, often using syllabaries or other systems.  While the sound represented by ""B"" may have existed in their spoken language, it would not have been represented by the letter ""B"" itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1365,Does a Trek 9000 require an anchor in order to park?,"A Trek 9000 is a bicycle.  Bicycles do not require anchors to park.  They are typically parked by leaning them against a wall, tree, or rack, or by using a bicycle lock to secure them to a fixed object.

"
1368,Is breakdancing safe for people with tendonitis?,"Breakdancing involves repetitive, high-impact movements that place significant stress on the tendons and joints.  Tendonitis is an inflammation of the tendons, often caused by overuse or repetitive strain.  The forceful, jarring movements inherent in breakdancing would likely exacerbate existing tendonitis and potentially cause new injuries.  Therefore, breakdancing is not considered safe for people with tendonitis.

Answer: {false}
"
1369,Did Marco Polo travel with Christopher Columbus?,"Marco Polo's travels took place in the 13th century, while Christopher Columbus's voyages occurred in the late 15th century.  There is a significant time gap between their explorations, making it impossible for them to have traveled together.

"
1372,Can a traffic collision make someone a millionaire?,"Explanation:
A traffic collision, while potentially causing significant injury and property damage, does not typically result in a direct financial windfall making someone a millionaire. While someone could receive a large settlement or insurance payout due to injuries or damages caused by the collision, the amount is highly variable and depends on many factors including the severity of injuries, extent of damages, insurance coverage, and legal representation.  It's highly improbable, though not impossible, that the settlement would reach the level of a million dollars.  Most settlements for traffic accidents are far less.

"
1375,Would a pacifist be opposed to hunting?,"Answer: A pacifist is someone opposed to violence and war. Hunting involves killing animals, which some would consider an act of violence.  Therefore, a pacifist would likely be opposed to hunting.  However, it's important to note that pacifism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and actions, and some pacifists might make exceptions or have nuanced views on hunting, depending on their specific interpretation of pacifist principles. For example, hunting for survival might be viewed differently than recreational hunting.

Answer: {true}
"
1376,Are selfies more dangerous than plague in modern times?,"Explanation:

The Black Death (plague) killed an estimated 30-60% of Europe's population in the 14th century.  While modern medicine has drastically reduced the impact of plague outbreaks, the potential for significant mortality still exists if a major outbreak were to occur.  

Selfies, while leading to some accidents and injuries (falls, drownings, etc.), do not pose a threat to even a tiny fraction of the global population in a comparable way to a widespread plague outbreak. The number of deaths attributable to taking selfies is comparatively insignificant on a global scale.

1377,Could you watch Naruto and Puzzle Place on the same channel?,"Naruto and Puzzle Place are shown on different channels.  Naruto is an anime series broadcast on various channels depending on region and licensing agreements, but it's not typically shown on the same channel as Puzzle Place, a children's show primarily found on YouTube and possibly on other streaming services or specific children's networks depending on region.  There is no single channel that broadcasts both.

"
1379,Did the Cherokee people send a delegation to oppose allotment?,"The Dawes Act of 1887, also known as the General Allotment Act, aimed to break up tribal lands and assimilate Native Americans into American society by allotting land to individual Native Americans.  The Cherokee Nation, like many other tribes, strongly opposed this act, seeing it as a destructive force that threatened their communal way of life and sovereignty.  Therefore, it is highly likely that the Cherokee people sent delegations to oppose the allotment policy.  While finding direct historical documentation confirming the sending of a specific delegation might require further research, the widespread Cherokee resistance to the Dawes Act makes it extremely probable.

Answer: {true}
"
1380,Do pediatricians perform abortions?,"Pediatricians specialize in the care of children from birth through adolescence.  Abortion procedures are performed on pregnant individuals, which is not within the scope of pediatric care.

1384,Would the United States Military Academy reject an applicant with multiple sclerosis?,"The United States Military Academy at West Point has high physical standards for its cadets.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often debilitating disease that affects the central nervous system.  The unpredictable nature of MS and its potential to impact physical abilities and cognitive function would likely make an applicant with the condition ineligible to meet the rigorous physical and mental demands of the academy.  While the specific criteria for medical disqualifications are not publicly available in detail, the demanding nature of the program makes it highly unlikely that an applicant with MS would be accepted.

Answer: {true}
"
1385,Does USA fail separation of church and state in multiple ways?,"The separation of church and state in the USA is a complex and often debated topic.  While the First Amendment explicitly prohibits the establishment of a state religion and guarantees freedom of religion, the interpretation and application of this principle have led to numerous controversies.

Several aspects suggest a failure of the separation:

* **Government funding of religious institutions:**  Government funding for religious schools or organizations, even indirectly through tax exemptions or vouchers, blurs the line between church and state.  Arguments exist on both sides regarding the legality and morality of this, but the practice undeniably leads to entanglement.

* **School prayer and religious instruction:**  The legality and prevalence of prayer in public schools, as well as the teaching of religious doctrines, remain contentious issues. While mandated school prayer is unconstitutional, the presence of voluntary prayer and the varying degrees of religious expression permitted in schools are sources of ongoing legal and social debate.

* **Religious displays on public property:**  The display of religious symbols, such as nativity scenes or crosses, on government property is a frequent source of legal challenges.  The Supreme Court has attempted to provide guidelines, but the issue remains contentious.

* **Pledges of allegiance and religious oaths:**  The recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the phrase ""under God,"" and the use of religious oaths in legal proceedings are examples of the integration of religious language and practices into government functions.  These practices raise questions about the neutrality of the state.

* **Political influence of religious groups:**  The significant political influence wielded by various religious groups in the USA, lobbying for legislation that aligns with their beliefs, raises concerns about the undue influence of religious ideologies on government policy.

Therefore, it's demonstrable that the USA's adherence to the separation of church and state is far from perfect.  Multiple areas showcase a substantial intertwining of religious and governmental institutions and practices.  The legal battles and ongoing debates surrounding these issues highlight a consistent and multifaceted failure to completely uphold the ideal of separation.

Answer: {true}
"
1386,Is Jesse W. Moore a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA?,"Jesse W. Moore is a name that doesn't readily appear in prominent NASA contexts or astronaut biographies.  Awards from NASA, especially those with distinctive themes like Snoopy (related to flight safety), are typically given to individuals with significant contributions to the space program, often astronauts or engineers.  Without any evidence suggesting Jesse W. Moore's involvement in NASA or space-related achievements, it's highly improbable he'd be a recipient of a Snoopy award.

"
1387,Can you get Raclette in YMCA headquarters city?,"The YMCA's headquarters is in Chicago, Illinois.  Raclette is a Swiss melted cheese dish.  While Chicago has a diverse culinary scene, the availability of Raclette specifically depends on the restaurant.  It's not a common dish in American cuisine, but it's not unheard of in major cities with a variety of restaurants.  It's more likely to be found in a specialized cheese shop or restaurant with a strong European focus.  Without more information, we cannot definitively say it's available, but it's possible.

1390,Does water have viscosity?,"Water, like all fluids, exhibits viscosity, although its viscosity is relatively low compared to many other liquids.  Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.  The water molecules interact with each other, creating internal friction that resists the movement of one layer of water over another.  While this resistance is small, it's still present,  meaning water does indeed have viscosity.

Answer: {false}
"
1394,Will Ahura Mazda have to look down to see Abaddon's dwelling??,"Ahura Mazda, the supreme god in Zoroastrianism, is typically depicted as residing in a heavenly realm.  Abaddon, in various mythologies (most prominently associated with Jewish and Christian traditions), is usually described as inhabiting the underworld or a hellish realm.  Therefore, if one were to envision these figures existing within a single cosmological framework, Ahura Mazda would indeed need to look downwards to see Abaddon's dwelling.

Answer: {true}
"
1395,"Would the fastest tortoise win a race against a Chicago ""L""?","Explanation:
The question asks if the fastest tortoise could win a race against a Chicago ""L"" train.  A Chicago ""L"" train is a rapid transit system; it travels at significant speed.  Tortoises, even the fastest, are notoriously slow.  Therefore, it's highly improbable, bordering on impossible, for a tortoise to win such a race.

1402,Was hippie culture encouraged by the government in the Soviet Union?,"Answer: The Soviet Union was a communist state that actively suppressed counter-cultural movements like the hippie movement.  Hippie culture, with its emphasis on individualism, anti-establishment sentiment, and rejection of materialism, directly contradicted the Soviet Union's ideology of collectivism and state control.  Therefore, the Soviet government would not have encouraged hippie culture.

1403,Was the AK-47 used in the Seven Years' War?,"The Seven Years' War took place between 1756 and 1763.  The AK-47 (Avtomat Kalashnikova) was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov and was first introduced to the Soviet Army in 1947.  Therefore, the AK-47 could not have been used in the Seven Years' War.

1404,Are you likely to find a crucifix in Karachi?,"Karachi is the capital of Sindh, Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country.  Christianity is a minority religion in Pakistan. While some Christians reside in Karachi, the prevalence of Christian symbols like crucifixes would be significantly lower than in countries with larger Christian populations.  Therefore, finding a crucifix in Karachi is less likely than in many other parts of the world.

1405,Has Alan Greenspan lived through at least a baker's dozen of president's?,"Alan Greenspan served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve under five US Presidents:  Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.  A baker's dozen is 13.  Since he served under five, he has lived through more than five, but not necessarily 13.  We would need to know how many presidents he's lived through since his birth.  However, it's reasonable to assume he has lived through at least 13 presidents given his age and the number of presidents during his lifetime.

Answer: {true}
"
1406,Would someone in Boston not receive the Toronto Star?,"The Toronto Star is a Canadian newspaper based in Toronto, Ontario.  Boston is a city in Massachusetts, USA.

1408,Do people with DID have a good memory?,"Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, involves the presence of two or more distinct personality states.  Memory is often fragmented and inconsistent across these different alters or personality states.  While some alters might have excellent memory for certain events or periods, others may have significant gaps or distortions in their memories.  Overall, memory function is not typically considered ""good"" in individuals with DID due to the nature of the disorder and its impact on memory consolidation and retrieval.  The experience is highly individualized, but a reliable, consistent, and complete memory is generally not a characteristic.

Answer: {false}
"
1409,Is CAS number 8009-03-8 harmful for a rash?,"CAS number 8009-03-8 refers to alginic acid, a polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweed.  Alginic acid and its derivatives are generally considered non-toxic and are used in various food and cosmetic products. While some individuals might experience mild skin irritation or allergic reactions, alginic acid itself isn't typically considered a primary cause of rashes.  A rash could be caused by other ingredients in a product containing alginic acid, or an unrelated condition.  Therefore, a direct causal link between CAS number 8009-03-8 and a rash is unlikely.

Answer: {false}

1412,Does walking across Amazonas put a person's life at risk?,"Answer: The Amazon rainforest is a vast and diverse ecosystem with many dangers.  These include:

* **Dangerous animals:**  The Amazon is home to numerous venomous snakes, spiders, insects, and other creatures that can inflict serious injury or death.
* **Disease:** Mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever are prevalent.  Other infectious diseases are also a risk.
* **Difficult terrain:** The terrain can be challenging to navigate, with dense vegetation, steep slopes, and unpredictable weather conditions.  Getting lost is a real possibility.
* **Lack of infrastructure:**  Much of the Amazon is remote, lacking adequate infrastructure, medical facilities, and rescue services.  An accident or injury can have severe consequences.
* **Illegal activity:**  Illegal logging, mining, and drug trafficking activities pose a threat to travelers.

Therefore, walking across the Amazon rainforest puts a person's life at significant risk due to the combination of environmental dangers, health threats, and the lack of easily accessible support.

Answer: {true}
"
1413,Do more Cauliflower grow in Arizona than California?,"California has a much larger land area dedicated to farming compared to Arizona, and a significantly more temperate climate suitable for growing a wide variety of crops, including cauliflower.  While Arizona does produce some cauliflower, its climate is generally hotter and drier, making it less ideal for this vegetable. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Arizona produces more cauliflower than California.

Answer: {false}
"
1414,Can horseradish be eaten in a religious context?,"Horseradish is not specifically mentioned in any major religious texts or traditions as being forbidden or having special religious significance.  While some cultures and religions have specific dietary laws or restrictions, horseradish doesn't appear to fall under any widely recognized prohibitions.  Its use in religious contexts would therefore depend entirely on individual or cultural practice, not on any established religious rule.

Answer: {true}
"
1418,Could one Amazon share ever buy twenty year Netflix subscription?,"Explanation:
To determine if one Amazon share could ever buy a 20-year Netflix subscription, we need to consider the price of an Amazon share and the cost of a Netflix subscription over 20 years.  The price of an Amazon share fluctuates constantly.  Similarly, the price of a Netflix subscription is subject to change.  Therefore, there's no single definitive answer.  At some point in time, it might be possible; at other times, it would not be.

Answer: {false}
"
1419,Did a gladiator kill his opponent with a shotgun?,"Answer: Gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome involved hand-to-hand fighting with swords, spears, and other melee weapons.  Shotguns are a modern invention.  Therefore, a gladiator could not have killed his opponent with a shotgun.

"
1420,Did a Mediterranean Sea creature kill Steve Irwin?,"Steve Irwin, the famous Australian wildlife expert, was killed by a stingray barb while filming a documentary in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, not the Mediterranean Sea.  Therefore, a Mediterranean Sea creature was not responsible for his death.

Answer: {false}
"
1421,Can E6000 cure before a hoverboard finishes the Daytona 500?,"The question asks whether E6000 adhesive can cure before a hoverboard completes the Daytona 500.  This is a comparison of two unrelated timeframes.

E6000's cure time varies depending on factors like temperature and thickness of the application. However, even its slowest cure times are measured in hours, not days.  The Daytona 500 race takes several hours to complete.

Therefore, while the exact cure time of E6000 is variable, it's highly likely to cure within the timeframe of the Daytona 500.

Answer: {true}
"
1422,Could Cosmic Girls play League of Legends alone?,"Cosmic Girls is a K-Pop group consisting of multiple members.  A single person cannot be a group. Therefore, Cosmic Girls, as a group, cannot play League of Legends alone.  They would need individual members to play separately.

"
1423,Is Y2K relevant to the plot of The Godfather?,"The Y2K problem, a potential computer systems failure anticipated for the year 2000, is entirely unrelated to the plot of Mario Puzo's *The Godfather* or its cinematic adaptations.  The Godfather's narrative focuses on the Corleone crime family, their internal power struggles, business dealings (primarily illegal), and interactions with rival families in the 1940s and 50s.  There's no mention or connection to computer systems or the Y2K bug.

"
1424,"On August 20, 2020,  does The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon air after moonset EST?","To determine if The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon aired after moonset EST on August 20, 2020, we need to know the moonset time in EST and the air time of the show.

The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon typically airs at 11:35 PM EST.  We need to find the moonset time for August 20, 2020, in a specific EST location (as moonset time varies slightly by location).  Unfortunately, I don't have access to a real-time astronomical database to provide that precise moonset time.  To answer this question accurately, one would need to consult an online astronomical calculator or ephemeris that can provide the moonset time for a specific location in the Eastern Time Zone on August 20, 2020.

Without that moonset time, I cannot definitively say whether the show aired after moonset.

Answer: {Unable to answer without moonset data for a specific EST location on August 20, 2020}
"
1425,Would a student of the class of 2017 have amnesia about 9/11?,"Answer: Students graduating in 2017 would have been born, at the latest, around 2000.  The September 11th attacks occurred in 2001.  Therefore, it is unlikely that they would have amnesia about the event, as they would have been too young to form memories of it.  However, it is possible that they have limited or fragmented memories from that time, depending on their age and exposure to information regarding 9/11. The question assumes amnesia, and while they might not have vivid personal memories, it's not amnesia.

Answer: {false}
"
1426,Would Janet Jackson avoid a dish with ham?,"Janet Jackson is a well-known vegetarian.  Ham is a meat product.  Therefore, it is highly likely that she would avoid a dish containing ham.

"
1427,Will twenty pea pods contents cover entire chess board?,"A standard chessboard has 64 squares.  A pea pod typically contains between 5 and 10 peas. Let's assume an average of 7.5 peas per pod.

Twenty pea pods would contain 20 pods * 7.5 peas/pod = 150 peas.

150 peas are unlikely to cover the entire surface area of a chessboard, even if the peas are relatively large.  A chessboard is quite sizable, and the peas would likely leave significant gaps.

Answer: {false}
"
1428,Were there footprints on the moon in 1960?,"The first moon landing, where the first footprints were left, was in 1969, not 1960.  Therefore, there were no footprints on the moon in 1960.

Answer: {false}
"
1429,Can the Supreme Court of Canada fight a Lucha trios match?,"The Supreme Court of Canada is a judicial body, not a group of professional wrestlers.  A Lucha trios match requires physical athleticism and fighting skills.  Judges are not trained for physical combat.

Answer: {false}
"
1430,Could the Atlantic readers fill 500 battalions?,"The question asks if the number of Atlantic readers could fill 500 battalions.  To answer this, we need to make several assumptions:

* **Size of a battalion:** A battalion's size varies greatly depending on the military and context.  Let's assume a conservative estimate of 500 soldiers per battalion.
* **Number of Atlantic readers:** We don't know the exact number of Atlantic readers.  Let's assume a very high, but still plausible, number—1 million.

If we assume 500 soldiers per battalion and 500 battalions, that means we need 250,000 soldiers (500 battalions * 500 soldiers/battalion).

Given our assumed 1 million Atlantic readers, it's clear that there are many more readers than soldiers needed to fill 500 battalions.

Answer: {true}

1432,Did Dr. Seuss live a tragedy free life?,"Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, experienced significant personal losses and hardships throughout his life.  While his public image was one of whimsical creativity, his life was marked by periods of depression, the death of his first wife, and struggles with his own mental health.  These experiences hardly constitute a ""tragedy-free"" life.

Answer: {false}
"
1433,Are Christmas trees dissimilar to deciduous trees?,"Christmas trees, which are often evergreen conifers like pines, firs, or spruces, retain their foliage year-round.  Deciduous trees, on the other hand, shed their leaves seasonally. This fundamental difference in leaf retention makes them dissimilar.

Answer: {true}
"
1434,Could a cow produce Harvey Milk?,"Explanation: Harvey Milk was a human political activist.  Cows are mammals that produce milk, but this milk is bovine milk, not human beings.  Therefore, a cow cannot produce a human being like Harvey Milk.

Answer: {false}
"
1435,Was song of Roland protagonist friendly with group that had sagas?,"The Song of Roland is a medieval epic poem.  The poem centers around Roland, a paladin of Charlemagne, and his fateful rearguard action at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.  The poem itself doesn't explicitly mention other sagas or groups that had them, nor does it portray Roland as having any kind of friendly relationship with such groups. The narrative focuses almost entirely on the conflict between Charlemagne's army and the Saracens.  Therefore, there's no basis in the text to support the idea that Roland was friendly with any group that possessed sagas.

Answer: {false}
"
1436,Are all cucumbers the same texture?,"The texture of a cucumber can vary depending on several factors including the variety of cucumber, its ripeness, and growing conditions.

Answer: {true}
"
1439,Does Hammurabi's Code violate Christians Golden Rule?,"Hammurabi's Code, a Babylonian legal code from the 18th century BC, features the ""eye for an eye"" principle of retributive justice.  This principle often involves harsh punishments that are disproportionate to the crime by modern standards.  The Christian Golden Rule, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" emphasizes empathy, compassion, and forgiveness.  The Golden Rule promotes reconciliation and rehabilitation, while Hammurabi's Code focuses on retribution and societal order through punishment.  Therefore, the emphasis on severe, often physically violent punishments in Hammurabi's Code directly contradicts the compassionate and forgiving nature of the Christian Golden Rule.

Answer: {true}
"
1440,Did any of religions in which Himalayas are sacred originate in 19th century?,"The Himalayas have been sacred to various religions for centuries, predating the 19th century by a significant margin.  Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, all with significant reverence for the Himalayas, have origins far earlier than the 19th century.  Therefore, no major religions that hold the Himalayas as sacred originated in the 19th century.

Answer: {false}
"
1441,Were the Ten commandments the part of the bible that Jewish people do not believe in?,"The Ten Commandments are a central part of Jewish belief and are found in the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible).  Jewish people absolutely believe in the Ten Commandments, though their interpretation and understanding may differ from other religious groups.  Therefore, the premise of the question is incorrect.

Answer: {false}
"
1442,Can you conduct surveillance from a teddy bear?,"Explanation:  A teddy bear, by its inherent design and lack of technological capabilities, cannot conduct surveillance.  It lacks the necessary components like cameras, microphones, recording devices, and a means of transmitting data. While a teddy bear *could* be modified to include such components, in its unmodified, standard form, it is incapable of surveillance.

Answer: {false}
"
1443,Would a retail associate envy the retailer's CEO's pay?,"Answer: A retail associate likely earns a significantly lower salary than a retailer's CEO.  CEO salaries are often in the millions of dollars annually, while retail associate salaries are typically hourly wages, often at minimum wage or slightly above. This significant pay disparity would likely lead to envy on the part of the retail associate.

Answer: {true}
"
1444,Can Tame Impala's studio band play a proper game of Hot Potato?,"Tame Impala's music is primarily created by Kevin Parker, although he employs session musicians for live performances and recordings.  A ""studio band"" in the traditional sense doesn't exist for Tame Impala. While there are multiple musicians involved in the creation and performance of Tame Impala's music, it's unclear whether they would regularly interact in a way that allows for a casual game of Hot Potato.  The lack of information on their social interactions outside of musical collaborations makes it unlikely to assume they could play Hot Potato.

Answer: {false}
"
1445,Is it bad to have lactic acid in your body?,"Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, meaning the body produces it when it doesn't have enough oxygen to break down glucose completely.  While some lactic acid is normal and the body can process it, excessive buildup can cause muscle soreness, fatigue, and other issues.  The body generally handles small amounts effectively, but excessive or prolonged production can lead to problems.  Therefore, it's not inherently ""bad"" to have lactic acid, but high levels are undesirable.

Answer: {false}
"
1446,Will Tokyo Tower be repainted only once during President Trump's first term?,"Answer: To determine if Tokyo Tower would be repainted only once during President Trump's first term, we need to consider the following:

* **President Trump's first term:** This lasted from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021.
* **Tokyo Tower repainting:**  The repainting schedule for Tokyo Tower is not tied to US presidential terms.  It's a regular maintenance procedure, performed on a schedule determined by factors like paint degradation and weather.  There's no information suggesting a single repainting would occur precisely within those four years.

Therefore, it's highly unlikely that a repainting would coincide exactly with those four years.

Answer: {false}
"
1447,Would the crew of Apollo 15 have difficulty riding a unicycle?,"The Apollo 15 crew consisted of astronauts who underwent rigorous physical and mental training.  While unicycle riding is a skill requiring balance and coordination, it's not a skill explicitly necessary for astronaut training.  Therefore, it's plausible that some members of the crew might find riding a unicycle difficult, while others might pick it up relatively quickly.  It is not a guaranteed outcome that *all* would have difficulty.

Answer: {false}
"
1448,Is it okay to lie after taking an oath in a court of law?,"Lying after taking an oath in a court of law is perjury, a serious crime.  The oath requires you to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Deliberately providing false testimony is a violation of that oath and carries significant legal consequences, including potential imprisonment.

Answer: {false}
"
1449,Is Newspeak considered very straightforward?,"Newspeak, the fictional language in George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, is designed to limit thought and expression by eliminating words associated with rebellion or independent thinking.  It achieves this through the reduction of vocabulary and the creation of words with double meanings that enforce Party ideology.  Therefore, Newspeak is far from straightforward; it's deliberately obfuscatory and restrictive.

Answer: {false}
"
1450,Do Snow White dwarves best The Hobbit dwarves in battle?,"This question requires comparing the fighting abilities of two fictional groups of dwarves: Snow White's seven dwarves and the dwarves from Tolkien's *The Hobbit*.  There's no canon information to definitively compare their combat skills.  We have to rely on inferences from the stories.

Snow White's dwarves are depicted as miners who live a relatively peaceful life, defending their home from a wicked queen. Their fighting skills are never explicitly shown, though they are implied to be capable of protecting themselves.

The dwarves in *The Hobbit* are explicitly portrayed as skilled warriors, experienced adventurers, and skilled fighters capable of facing trolls, goblins, wargs, and even Smaug. They possess weapons, armor, and combat experience that far surpasses any implied capabilities of Snow White's dwarves.

Therefore, based on the available information and depictions within their respective narratives, the dwarves from *The Hobbit* are far more likely to win a battle against Snow White's dwarves.


Answer: {false}
"
1451,Is Statue of Unity hypothetically more level with Statue of Liberty than Lighthouse of Alexandria?,"The question asks about the relative levelness of three structures: the Statue of Unity, the Statue of Liberty, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.  ""Level"" in this context likely refers to how upright and stable the structures are, not their elevation above sea level.

The Statue of Unity is a relatively new structure and is built using modern engineering techniques, making it likely very stable and level.  The Statue of Liberty, while older, has undergone significant maintenance and restoration, also keeping it relatively level. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, however, is an ancient structure, destroyed long ago. Any remaining parts are likely not level due to age, damage, and the effects of time.

Therefore, it is highly likely that both the Statue of Unity and the Statue of Liberty are more level than the ruins of the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

Answer: {true}
"
1452,Did the Football War last at least a month?,"The Football War, also known as the Soccer War, was a brief conflict between El Salvador and Honduras in July 1969.  It lasted for roughly 100 hours, which is less than a month.

"
1453,Are peaches best eaten when firm?,"Peaches are best eaten when they are slightly soft, but not mushy.  A firm peach is often underripe and will lack sweetness and flavor.  While a completely mushy peach is overripe, a slightly yielding peach indicates ripeness and optimal flavor.

Answer: {false}
"
1454,Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?,"Adam Sandler is a comedian known for his comedic roles in films.  A reference to Cole Sprouse (an actor known for his roles in Disney Channel shows and Riverdale) and a scuba man doll are not intrinsically linked to Adam Sandler's comedic persona or known works.  There's no established connection between them.  While Sandler might *theoretically* incorporate such references into his comedy, it's not a likely or expected occurrence.

Answer: {false}
"
1455,Will Lhamo Thondup be considered by Catholic Church to be a saint?,"Lhamo Thondup, also known as the 14th Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, not Catholicism.  The Catholic Church has its own process for canonization, requiring evidence of miracles and a life lived in accordance with Christian teachings.  The Dalai Lama, while a highly revered spiritual figure, does not meet the criteria for sainthood within the Catholic Church.

Answer: {false}
"
1456,Can children be hurt by jalapeno peppers?,"Jalapeno peppers contain capsaicin, a compound that causes a burning sensation.  While the level of capsaicin varies, even mild jalapenos can irritate a child's sensitive mouth and throat, causing burning, discomfort, and potentially even temporary swelling.  Young children, especially, may have difficulty managing the burning sensation and could experience distress. Therefore, it is possible for children to be hurt by jalapeno peppers.

Answer: {true}
"
1457,Would it be typical for a Rede Globo anchor to say Konnichiwa to the viewers?,"Rede Globo is a major Brazilian television network.  ""Konnichiwa"" is a Japanese greeting.  It would be highly unusual and inappropriate for a Rede Globo anchor to greet viewers with a Japanese phrase, as it would be irrelevant to the Brazilian context and likely confuse or alienate the audience.

Answer: {false}
"
1458,Can you see live harbor seals in Washington DC?,"Washington D.C. is not located on the coast and does not have a harbor environment suitable for harbor seals.  Harbor seals are marine mammals that require access to saltwater and typically inhabit coastal areas.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely to see harbor seals in Washington D.C.

Answer: {false}
"
1459,Would 2020 Toyota Supra lag behind at a Nascar rally?,"NASCAR uses highly modified stock cars, purpose-built for speed and endurance on oval tracks.  A standard 2020 Toyota Supra, while a sports car, is not designed for the demands of NASCAR racing.  It lacks the necessary modifications (engine, suspension, safety features, etc.) to compete.  Therefore, it would significantly lag behind.

Answer: {true}
"
1460,Can a human eat an entire 12-lb roast turkey in an hour?,"Answer: The average human stomach can hold approximately 1-1.5 liters, or roughly 1-1.5 quarts.  A 12-lb turkey is a substantial amount of food, far exceeding the capacity of a human stomach.  Even if someone were able to physically consume that much food, the sheer volume would likely cause discomfort, nausea, and potentially serious health problems.  It's highly improbable that a person could comfortably and safely eat a 12-lb turkey in an hour.

Answer: {false}

"
1462,Can Viper Room concert hypothetically be held at National Diet building?,"The Viper Room is a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, famous for its association with the entertainment industry.  The National Diet Building is the meeting place of the Japanese Diet (parliament) in Tokyo, Japan.  A concert of the scale implied by ""Viper Room concert"" would be entirely inappropriate and impossible to hold in a building designed for legislative purposes. The security, acoustics, and overall infrastructure of the National Diet Building are not suitable for a concert event.  Therefore, such an event would be highly improbable.

Answer: {false}
"
1463,Would vegans consider chickpeas for a tuna substitute?,"Vegans avoid all animal products, including tuna. Chickpeas are a plant-based food.  Therefore, vegans might consider chickpeas as a substitute for tuna in recipes that require a similar texture or function.  They are a common ingredient in vegan ""tuna"" salad recipes.

Answer: {true}
"
1464,Were Beauty and the Beast adaptations devoid of Kurt Sutter collaborators?,"Kurt Sutter is a writer and director known for his work on FX's ""Sons of Anarchy"" and other projects with a specific style.  There is no indication that he has collaborated on any adaptations of ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Therefore, it's highly likely that any ""Beauty and the Beast"" adaptations would be devoid of his collaborators.

Answer: {true}
"
1465,Would Swiss Guard defeat the Marines?,"Answer: The Swiss Guard is a ceremonial unit with a small number of highly trained soldiers, while the United States Marines are a large, modern, and technologically advanced fighting force.  While the Swiss Guard are highly skilled and well-trained in their specific roles, they are vastly outnumbered and outmatched in terms of weaponry, equipment, and overall military capabilities by the Marines.  A direct confrontation would almost certainly result in a decisive victory for the Marines.

Answer: {false}

"
1467,Was Edward II crucial to England's victory at Battle of Falkirk?,"Edward II was not involved in the Battle of Falkirk.  The Battle of Falkirk took place in 1298, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. Edward II did not become king until 1307, after his father, Edward I, died.  Therefore, Edward II played no role whatsoever in the battle.

Answer: {false}
"
1468,Was Emperor Commodus paid tribute in Pound sterling?,"Answer: The Roman Empire existed long before the British Pound Sterling was established.  The Pound Sterling's origins trace back to the 12th century, while the Roman Empire fell in the 5th century. Therefore, Emperor Commodus could not have been paid tribute in Pound sterling.

Answer: {false}
"
1469,Should spaghetti be slick when cooked?,"Properly cooked spaghetti should have a slight sheen and be tender but not mushy.

1470,Was the Carnation Revolution the deadliest revolution in Europe?,"The Carnation Revolution, which took place in Portugal in 1974, was a relatively bloodless coup d'état.  It's known for its peaceful nature and lack of widespread violence compared to other European revolutions.  Many other European revolutions, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, resulted in significantly higher casualties.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that the Carnation Revolution was the deadliest in Europe.

1471,Would hypothermia be a concern for a human wearing zoot suit on Triton?,"Triton, Neptune's largest moon, has a surface temperature of approximately -235°C (-391°F).  A zoot suit, while stylish, offers minimal thermal protection against such extreme cold.  Even with multiple layers underneath, the suit wouldn't prevent hypothermia, which is a significant risk at such frigid temperatures.  The individual would likely succumb to hypothermia very quickly.

1473,Could you brew beer from start to finish in the month of September?,"The brewing process involves several stages, each taking a specific amount of time:

1. **Malting:** While you can buy pre-malted barley, malting barley yourself takes several weeks. This is not feasible within a month.
2. **Mashing and Lautering:** This process, where the grains are mixed with hot water to release sugars, takes a few hours.
3. **Boiling and Hops Addition:**  Boiling the wort (the sugary liquid) with hops takes around an hour.
4. **Fermentation:**  This is the longest stage, typically lasting 1-3 weeks depending on the yeast strain and desired alcohol content.
5. **Bottling/Kegging:**  This process takes a few hours to a day, but requires the beer to have fully fermented and clarified.
6. **Conditioning/Carbonation:**  Conditioning allows the beer to fully carbonate naturally (bottle conditioning) or to be carbonated under pressure (kegging). This process also takes time, several weeks for bottle conditioning.

While steps 2-5 could potentially be completed within a month, the fermentation and conditioning stages alone often exceed a month. Therefore, brewing a beer from start to finish (including malting from grain) within the month of September is highly unlikely.  Even starting with pre-malted barley, the fermentation and conditioning time will likely push past the end of the month, depending on the recipe and the yeast used.

Answer: {false}

1475,Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?,"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.  These neurotransmitters are implicated in mood regulation.  Inhibitors of MAO (MAOIs) are used as antidepressants because they increase the levels of these neurotransmitters.  A candy bar containing MAO would have the *opposite* effect, potentially *decreasing* levels of these neurotransmitters and worsening depression. Therefore, a candy bar containing MAO would not cheer up a depressed friend.

1478,Is Europa (moon) name origin related to Amunet?,"Europa, one of Jupiter's four largest moons (the Galilean moons), is named after the Phoenician princess Europa from Greek mythology.  Amunet, on the other hand, is an ancient Egyptian goddess. There's no etymological or mythological connection between the two names.  The naming of Jupiter's moons by Simon Marius after figures from Greek mythology is well documented and distinct from Egyptian mythology and deities.

1480,"Will every resident of Los Angeles County, California go to Jehovah Witnesses's heaven?","Jehovah's Witnesses have a specific set of beliefs about who goes to heaven, which does not include everyone.  Their theology centers around the idea of a limited number of people being chosen for heavenly life, and these individuals must meet specific criteria based on their faith and actions.  The vast majority of Jehovah's Witnesses believe that most people will live in a paradise on earth, not in heaven. Therefore, it's highly improbable that every resident of Los Angeles County, or indeed anyone beyond a select few, would go to the Jehovah's Witnesses' heaven.

1489,Will electric car struggle to finish Daytona 500?,"Electric cars have significantly shorter driving ranges than gasoline-powered cars.  The Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race.  Even with advancements in battery technology, current electric car technology is not capable of completing a race of that distance without multiple battery changes or recharging stops, which would be impossible within the race's time constraints.  Therefore, an electric car would struggle significantly and likely not finish the Daytona 500.

Answer: {true}
"
1490,Does meat from cows fed only grass taste more like wild game?,"Grass-fed beef has a leaner, more intense flavor profile compared to grain-fed beef.  While it won't taste exactly like wild game, which can vary significantly depending on the animal and its diet, grass-fed beef often has a gamier taste than grain-fed beef due to the difference in fat content and the types of nutrients the cows consume.  The gamier taste is often described as earthier or more savory.  Therefore, while not identical, it does exhibit qualities closer to the taste of wild game than grain-fed beef.

Answer: {true}
"
1491,Would King Leonidas have succeeded with an army the size of Mozart's compositions?,"Explanation:

This question requires us to compare the size of Leonidas' army at the Battle of Thermopylae to the number of Mozart's compositions.  

* **Leonidas' Army:**  At the Battle of Thermopylae, Leonidas commanded a force of around 7,000 Greek soldiers.  While the exact number is debated, it's generally accepted to be in the several thousand range.

* **Mozart's Compositions:** Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed hundreds of works.  Estimates vary, but a conservative estimate would be over 600. It is unlikely the number will reach 7000.

Therefore, Mozart's compositions are far fewer than the size of Leonidas' army.  Leonidas would not have succeeded with an army the size of Mozart's compositions; that army would be far too small to make any significant impact in a battle like Thermopylae.

Answer: {false}

1494,Have Jamie Lee Curtis been the subject of fake news?,"Jamie Lee Curtis is a well-known public figure, and as such, she has been the subject of various rumors and fabricated stories spread through social media and other platforms.  While not necessarily large-scale or highly impactful fake news events in the way some political figures might experience, the sheer volume of online content means it is highly probable that false information relating to her has been circulated.  These might involve false quotes attributed to her, inaccurate reports of her activities, or fabricated stories about her personal life.  The prevalence of misinformation online makes it likely that she has been affected at some point.

1502,Did Jesus know anyone who spoke Estonian?,"The question asks whether Jesus knew anyone who spoke Estonian.  Estonian is a Finnic language spoken primarily in Estonia.  Estonia's location in Northern Europe, and its history, places it far outside the geographical and historical context of Jesus's life and ministry in the Roman province of Judea during the 1st century CE.  There is no historical evidence, biblical or otherwise, to suggest that Jesus or anyone in his immediate circle knew anyone who spoke Estonian.

"
1508,Are sea turtles enjoying life during quarantine?,"Sea turtles are not impacted by human-enforced quarantines.  Their lives continue largely unaffected by changes in human activity levels.  While some human activity, like pollution, negatively impacts them,  a period of reduced human activity in the ocean due to quarantine is unlikely to have a significantly positive or negative impact on their overall well-being.  Their enjoyment of life is subjective and impossible to assess scientifically.

1510,Does actress Leila George lack the height to be a model?,"Leila George's height is not publicly known with certainty.  There is no readily available information on her height to determine if she meets the typical height requirements for modeling.  While some sources might speculate, without confirmed height information, it's impossible to definitively say whether she lacks the height to be a model.  Many successful models fall outside of the typical height range, and success in modeling depends on many factors beyond just height.

1511,Would a modern central processing unit circuit chip fit on a housekey?,"A modern CPU circuit chip is incredibly small, but it's still significantly larger than a house key.  While the individual transistors are microscopic, the overall die size of even a low-power CPU is many millimeters across. A house key, on the other hand, is only a few millimeters wide and a centimeter or so long.  There's simply no way to fit the complex circuitry of even the smallest modern CPU onto such a small surface area.

"
1516,Would a sesame seed be mistaken for a wood frog egg?,"Sesame seeds are small, dark, and oval-shaped. Wood frog eggs are also small and dark, but they are gelatinous and laid in masses. While a single sesame seed might be similar in size and color to a single wood frog egg, the texture and context would be vastly different.  A mass of wood frog eggs would be readily distinguishable from a scattering of sesame seeds.  Therefore, it is unlikely a sesame seed would be mistaken for a wood frog egg.

"
1518,Does bull shark bite hurt worse than crocodile bite?,"The severity of a bull shark bite versus a crocodile bite depends on many factors, including the size and species of both animals, the location and force of the bite, and the individual's reaction to the injury.  Both bull sharks and crocodiles possess powerful jaws and sharp teeth capable of inflicting serious injuries.  Crocodile bites tend to be more crushing, often causing extensive tissue damage, while shark bites can be more lacerating. However, there's no definitive answer as to which is ""worse"" – the pain and resulting injury could be comparable or even vary depending on the circumstances.  Neither bite is pleasant; both can result in significant trauma, infection, and even death.

"
1521,Is it possible to get killed walking to the Very Large Telescope?,"The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, a remote and arid region. While the immediate vicinity of the VLT is likely safe and well-maintained, the surrounding desert environment presents certain dangers.  These could include:

* **Exposure to the elements:** The Atacama Desert is known for extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, and intense sun.  Dehydration and sunstroke are significant risks.
* **Wildlife:** While not necessarily aggressive, encounters with desert wildlife could potentially lead to injury.
* **Accidents:**  Falls, especially in uneven terrain, are possible.  
* **Vehicle accidents:**  If approaching the VLT by car, there's a risk of vehicle accidents on desert roads.
* **Lack of immediate medical assistance:** Being a remote location, access to prompt medical care may be limited in the case of an accident or serious injury.


While the direct path to the VLT itself is probably relatively safe, the surrounding environment holds dangers that could theoretically lead to death.  It's unlikely that someone would be directly attacked and killed on the path, but the combination of environmental factors, potential accidents and lack of immediate medical help represents a theoretical risk of death.

1523,Was 847 Pope Leo same iteration of his name as Ivan the Terrible?,"Pope Leo VIII reigned from 963 to 965 AD. Ivan the Terrible (Ivan IV) was the Grand Duke of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and then Tsar of Russia from 1547 to 1584.  They are not the same person and lived centuries apart.  There were many Popes named Leo and many rulers named Ivan.  The question implies they are the same person with the same name in a different culture, which is incorrect.

"
1524,Did mercenaries fight for England in the Glorious Revolution?,"The Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw William of Orange invade England to overthrow James II. While the main fighting force was composed of English and Dutch troops loyal to William, there's no significant historical evidence to suggest that mercenaries formed a substantial part of either side's army.  William had a standing army, and much of the support for him came from within England itself.  While it's possible some individual mercenaries might have been present, they wouldn't have constituted a significant or defining element of the conflict. The revolution was largely achieved through political maneuvering and a relatively limited military campaign relying on existing forces.

1527,Do people of the Iyer caste eat meat?,"The Iyer caste is a Brahmin caste within the Tamil community in South India.  Traditionally, Brahmins follow a vegetarian diet, abstaining from meat consumption due to religious and cultural beliefs.  However, modern society has seen changes in dietary practices, and while many Iyers still adhere to vegetarianism, it is not universally true that all Iyers are vegetarian.  There are Iyers who do consume meat.  Therefore, the answer cannot be definitively yes or no.

"
1528,Would Hades and Osiris hypothetically compete for real estate in the Underworld?,"Hades is the Greek god of the Underworld, and Osiris is the Egyptian god of the Underworld.

1529,Would General Zod prefer an iPhone over a Samsung Galaxy S4?,"General Zod is a fictional character from DC Comics known for his Kryptonian heritage and advanced technology.  While his preferences are not explicitly stated, it's reasonable to assume he would favor technology reflecting Kryptonian advancement.  Given that Apple products are generally considered to be at the forefront of technological innovation and design, it's more likely he'd prefer an iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy S4, while a good phone for its time, was not necessarily on the cutting edge in the same way.

Additionally, oranges are rich in fiber, and too much fiber can also cause diarrhea in some individuals.

Answer: {true}
"
1532,Should someone prone to jealousy be in a polyamorous relationship?,"Jealousy is a strong emotion characterized by envy and insecurity, often triggered by perceived threats to a relationship.  Polyamorous relationships, by their nature, involve multiple romantic partners.  This inherent multiplicity increases the potential for situations that could trigger jealousy, such as a partner spending time with another partner or showing affection to someone else.  While some polyamorous individuals are able to manage jealousy successfully, often through open communication and established boundaries, it's a significant challenge that could negatively impact the relationship if not addressed effectively.  A person prone to jealousy would likely find a polyamorous relationship significantly more difficult to navigate than a monogamous one and might experience increased emotional distress.

Answer: {false}
"
1533,Did Christopher Columbus condone multiple deadly sins?,"Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas resulted in the deaths of countless indigenous people through violence, enslavement, and the spread of disease.  These actions could be interpreted as encompassing multiple deadly sins, depending on the theological framework used.  For example, his actions could be seen as encompassing murder (killing), greed (exploitation of resources and people), lust (sexual exploitation), and pride (his arrogance and belief in his own superiority). While the specific definition of ""deadly sins"" varies among religions and interpretations, the immense suffering and death caused by Columbus's actions aligns with the general concept of multiple serious transgressions against morality.

Answer: {true}
"
1534,Did the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hurt the stocks of robotics companies?,"Answer: The Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred well before the development of the robotics industry as we know it today.  Robotics as a field didn't truly emerge until much later, in the mid-20th century. Therefore, there were no publicly traded robotics companies in 1929 whose stocks could be affected by the crash.

"
1535,Could Christopher Nolan's movies finance Cyprus's entire GDP?,"To determine if Christopher Nolan's movies could finance Cyprus's entire GDP, we need to estimate the total box office revenue of his films and compare it to Cyprus's GDP.  Finding precise figures for every Nolan film's worldwide box office gross adjusted for inflation would be a complex task. However, we can make a reasonable estimation.

Christopher Nolan is known for directing high-grossing films.  While some of his earlier movies may have lower box office totals, his recent films have consistently generated hundreds of millions of dollars globally.  Let's assume, conservatively, that the combined worldwide box office gross of all his films is in the billions of dollars.

Cyprus's GDP is significantly lower than a billion dollars.  Therefore, it's highly likely that the total box office revenue from Christopher Nolan's films would exceed Cyprus's GDP.  While this is a rough estimation, the disparity in scale makes the conclusion highly probable.

1539,Were Greeks essential to crafting Egyptian Lighthouse of Alexandria?,"The Lighthouse of Alexandria was built in ancient Egypt.  While there's no direct evidence that Greeks were *essential* in the sense of being the sole or primary architects or engineers,  Greek influence on Ptolemaic Egypt was significant.  The Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt at the time of the lighthouse's construction, was of Greek origin.  This means Greek architects, engineers, and workers likely played a role in the project's design and construction.  It's impossible to definitively say whether their contribution was ""essential"" in the strictest sense, as the exact details of the construction process aren't fully documented, but their involvement was almost certainly substantial given the cultural and political context.

1540,Does the judo rank system reach the triple digits?,"The judo rank system uses a system of kyu (beginner) ranks and dan (advanced) ranks.  Kyu ranks typically go from 6th kyu to 1st kyu, and dan ranks continue beyond 10th dan in some organizations, although the 10th dan is considered the highest attainable rank in many.  Therefore, the judo rank system does reach triple digits in some organizations.

1552,Could someone theoretically use an armadillo as a shield?,"An armadillo's shell is made of bony plates covered in tough keratin.  While not impenetrable, it offers a degree of protection from minor impacts and potentially some sharp objects.  However, the effectiveness of an armadillo as a shield would be highly limited and dependent on the nature of the threat.  A bullet or a large, sharp object would likely pierce the shell.  Furthermore, an armadillo is a living creature and would likely not remain still or willingly cooperate in such a situation.

1557,Could the Toyota Stadium sit a tenth of the population of Gotheburg?,"Here's how we can solve this:

1. **Find the population of Gothenburg:** A quick search shows the population of Gothenburg, Sweden is approximately 580,000 people.

1558,Could a Jujutsu expert hypothetically defeat a Janissary?,"Answer: A Jujutsu expert's training emphasizes grappling, throws, joint locks, and striking techniques.  Janissaries were elite Ottoman infantry known for their discipline, proficiency with firearms (especially early muskets), and use of scimitars and other melee weapons in close quarters.

While a skilled Jujutsu practitioner could potentially exploit a Janissary's relative lack of grappling defense to gain an advantage, the Janissary's firearm would present a significant threat at a distance.  The outcome would heavily depend on the specific skills of the individuals, the range of engagement, and the environment of the fight. It is not a certainty that a Jujutsu expert would win.

Answer: {false}

"
1561,Are pirate lieutenants like navy lieutenants?,"Pirate lieutenants and navy lieutenants share a commonality in their titles, both indicating a rank of command. However, their roles, responsibilities, and the context of their authority differ significantly.  A navy lieutenant holds a commissioned officer rank within a formal, structured military organization with established rules of engagement, chain of command, and legal frameworks.  A pirate lieutenant, on the other hand, serves under a captain in a largely lawless and informal organization. Their responsibilities would be determined by the pirate captain and the specific needs of the crew and their criminal activities.  The structure and legitimacy of their authority are entirely different.  Therefore, while the titles are similar, the roles and contexts are vastly dissimilar.

Answer: {false}
"
1562,Could a Hwasong-15 missile hypothetically reach Voyager 2?,"The Hwasong-15 is a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  While its range is estimated to be significant, reaching a substantial portion of the globe, it is nowhere near the distance to Voyager 2. Voyager 2 is currently far beyond the orbit of Pluto, in interstellar space, billions of kilometers away from Earth.  The Hwasong-15's capabilities, even at maximum range, are drastically insufficient to reach such an immense distance.

"
1564,Will Conan the Barbarian hypothetically last a short time inside of Call of Duty?,"Explanation:

Conan the Barbarian is a fictional character known for his immense strength, fighting prowess, and resilience.  Call of Duty is a video game series known for its fast-paced, modern/future warfare combat.  Conan's skills might translate somewhat to the game, particularly in close-quarters combat.  However, he lacks the modern weaponry, tactical training, and strategic awareness that would allow him to survive in the high-tech combat environment and against skilled, modern-armed opponents.  He'd likely be overwhelmed by superior firepower, tactical maneuvers, and modern weaponry.  Therefore, his survival time would likely be short.

1568,Is Supreme Court of the United States analogous to High Courts of Justice of Spain?,"The Supreme Court of the United States and the High Courts of Justice of Spain both function as the highest courts in their respective countries' judicial systems.  They serve as courts of last resort, meaning their decisions are final and binding.  Both also have the power of judicial review, enabling them to strike down laws deemed unconstitutional or incompatible with the country's foundational legal framework.  However, there are differences in their structure and specific powers.  The Supreme Court of the US is comprised of nine justices, while the Spanish High Courts of Justice are structured differently depending on the region.  Also, the specifics of their jurisdiction and the details of their procedures differ.  While analogous in their role as the highest courts, they are not identical.  The similarities are in their ultimate authority and power of judicial review, but their structures and operational details differ.

"
1573,Are Citizens of Bern Switzerland are descendants of Genghis Khan?,"Answer: There is no evidence linking the citizens of Bern, Switzerland to Genghis Khan or his descendants.  Genealogical studies would be needed to trace the lineage of a population, and no such studies demonstrate a connection to the Mongol Empire. While Genghis Khan's empire was vast, it didn't extend to Switzerland, and there's no historical record suggesting a significant migration or intermingling of populations that would result in a substantial percentage of Bern's citizenry being direct descendants.

"
1574,Is Maruti Suzuki Baleno an efficient car for Linus Torvald's family?,"Linus Torvalds is known for his frugality and practical approach to life.  While the Maruti Suzuki Baleno is a relatively fuel-efficient and affordable car, its suitability for his family depends on their specific needs and preferences.  There is no publicly available information regarding the size of his family or their transportation requirements.  The Baleno might be sufficient for a small family, but for a larger family or one with specific needs, a more spacious or feature-rich vehicle might be preferred.  Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say whether it would be efficient for his family without more information.

Answer: {false}
"
1577,Are there some countries where waiting staff need no tip?,"Many cultures have different norms regarding tipping.  In some countries, service charges are included in the bill, making tipping unnecessary or even considered rude. In others, wages for service staff are higher, reducing reliance on tips.  While it's difficult to definitively say ""no tipping is ever expected,"" there are countries where tipping is less common or less expected than in others, such as Japan, South Korea, and some parts of Europe.  The extent to which tipping is expected can also vary even within a single country, depending on the establishment and the level of service.

Therefore, they are related, albeit distantly.

Answer: {true}
"
1584,Can a rabbi save the soul of a Christian?,"The question asks whether a rabbi can save the soul of a Christian.  This depends entirely on one's theological perspective.  

* **From a Jewish perspective:**  Judaism generally focuses on the salvation of Jewish souls through adherence to Jewish law and tradition.  The concept of ""saving"" a non-Jewish soul isn't a central tenet. A rabbi might offer spiritual guidance and acts of kindness to anyone, but the idea of ""saving"" a soul in the Christian sense wouldn't typically be part of their framework.

* **From a Christian perspective:**  Christian theology generally centers around the belief that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ. A rabbi, not being a follower of Christ, would not typically be seen as able to offer this kind of salvation.

* **From a secular perspective:**  The very concept of ""saving a soul"" is not something addressed in secular thought.  A rabbi, like any other person, could offer support, understanding, and kindness, but not spiritual salvation in a religious context.

Therefore, the answer depends heavily on the belief system being considered.  There is no universally accepted answer.

Answer: {false}
"
1585,Will a person survive a fever of NY's highest recorded temperature?,"Explanation:
New York City's highest recorded temperature is 106°F (41°C).  A fever of this magnitude is far beyond what is considered a typical fever, and would be life-threatening.  A fever this high would severely disrupt the body's core functions, potentially leading to organ damage and death.  While some individuals might have a higher tolerance, surviving a 106°F fever is highly unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
1586,Are Mayors safe from harm from the federal government?,"Mayors are local government officials.  The federal government has a limited role in local affairs unless a mayor commits a federal crime or acts against federal laws. While the federal government could theoretically take actions against a mayor, they are not immune from harm in the sense that the federal government could investigate or prosecute them for crimes, or if a mayor engages in actions that violate federal law, the federal government could intervene.  However, it's not a common occurrence for the federal government to directly target mayors, and the mayor's position itself doesn't provide inherent protection.

Answer: {false}
"
1587,Did the Nepalese Civil War take place near India?,"The Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006) was fought within the borders of Nepal.  Nepal shares a long border with India.  Therefore, the war took place near India geographically.

Answer: {false}
"
1590,Could largest asteroid crush a whole city?,"Explanation:
The size and mass of an asteroid would determine its destructive potential.  While a large asteroid impact could easily obliterate a city, the size needed is considerable.  The energy released upon impact is a function of the asteroid's mass and velocity.  A 900,000 pound asteroid is relatively small compared to the asteroids that have caused mass extinctions in the Earth's past.  While it would be devastating, a single city's destruction might not necessarily be assured, as many factors like composition, angle of impact, and ground type affect the impact's outcome.  A smaller asteroid might cause significant damage but likely wouldn't entirely crush a whole city.

Answer: {false}
"
1591,Walt Disney dominated his amusement park peers at Academy Awards?,"Walt Disney and his company, The Walt Disney Company, have won numerous Academy Awards, but this is not in relation to amusement parks.  The Oscars are awarded for film, not theme park achievements.  Therefore, while Disney was a dominant figure in the film industry and won many Oscars, this doesn't translate to dominance over peers in the amusement park industry at the Academy Awards.

"
1592,Has Billy Joel sold out Astana Arena?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:  There's no information readily available to indicate whether Billy Joel has ever performed at, much less sold out, the Astana Arena in Kazakhstan.  While Billy Joel is a very popular musician with a long career, it's highly improbable that information about every single concert venue he may or may not have played at would be consistently documented publicly.  The absence of readily available evidence suggests he has not played there.
"
1593,Was Mesopotamia part of what is now China?,"Mesopotamia, located in the region of modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, and Turkey, is geographically distant from China.  The civilizations of Mesopotamia and China developed independently and had very different cultures and histories.  Therefore, Mesopotamia was not part of what is now China.

Answer: {false}
"
1594,Can a martyr saint have been excommunicated?,"Answer: A martyr saint, by definition, is someone who died for their faith.  Excommunication is the formal exclusion of a person from the communion of a church or other religious body.  While it's theoretically possible for someone to be excommunicated before becoming a martyr (perhaps for beliefs considered heretical before their martyrdom), the act of martyrdom often leads to the reversal of any prior excommunication, as the ultimate sacrifice for their faith is seen as a testament to their devotion.  The process of canonization often involves investigating the life of the candidate, and any prior excommunication would be carefully considered. While unlikely, it's not logically impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
1595,"In order to work in district management, does one need a car?","District management often involves travel between different locations within a district.  While public transportation might be sufficient in some densely populated areas, reliable personal transportation is usually necessary for efficient and timely site visits, meetings with stakeholders, and addressing urgent issues across a geographically dispersed district.  Therefore, having a car is generally considered a practical necessity, although not always an absolute requirement depending on specific circumstances and available public transport options.

Answer: {true}
"
1596,Can nitric acid break the Louvre?,"Nitric acid is a highly corrosive acid.  It would likely damage or destroy many of the materials used in the construction and artwork of the Louvre Museum, including stone, metal, and paint.

"
1600,Could Arnold Schwarzenegger hypothetically defeat Hafþór Björnsson in a powerlifting competition if both are at their peak strength?,"Explanation:

Hafþór Björnsson is a professional strongman known for his incredible strength and powerlifting records.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, while incredibly strong for a bodybuilder, was never a powerlifter in the same vein as Björnsson.  Björnsson's specialization and training are geared towards maximal strength in powerlifting events (like deadlifts, squats, and bench press). While Schwarzenegger was exceptionally strong, his focus was on bodybuilding aesthetics and overall physique rather than maximizing powerlifting specific strength.  Even at their peaks, Björnsson's training and genetics would likely give him a significant advantage in a direct powerlifting competition against Schwarzenegger.

Answer: {false}
"
1601,Would the number 666 appear in a church?,"The number 666 is associated with the biblical ""number of the beast"" in the Book of Revelation.  While some churches might choose to avoid displaying the number prominently, its appearance in various contexts (like a page number in a Bible, a date, an address, or as part of a decorative element) isn't inherently forbidden or unusual. The presence or absence of the number would depend entirely on the specific church and its design.  Therefore, it's possible to find the number 666 in a church.

Answer: {true}
"
1602,"Could Elizabeth I of England have seen the play Dido, Queen of Carthage ?","The play *Dido, Queen of Carthage*, a collaborative effort by Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Nashe, was likely written and performed sometime between 1587 and 1597. Elizabeth I reigned from 1558 to 1603.  Therefore, it is entirely possible Elizabeth I could have seen a performance of the play during her reign.

1606,Would Modafinil be effective in completing a suicide?,"Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent, not a substance directly causing death through overdose. While some medications can be lethal in overdose, Modafinil is not typically associated with such effects.  The primary risk associated with Modafinil overdose is typically cardiovascular issues, but this isn't a guaranteed fatal outcome.  Suicidal ideation and attempts often involve means designed to directly end life, and Modafinil does not fit that profile.

Answer: {false}
"
1607,Is it unusual to eat spaghetti without a fork?,"Eating spaghetti without a fork is unusual in many cultures, particularly Western ones, where the fork is the standard utensil for eating pasta. While some cultures might use other utensils or even their hands, using only a fork is overwhelmingly common and considered the norm.  Therefore, it's unusual to eat spaghetti without a fork.

Therefore, he would be ineligible to run for President of the US.

Answer: {true}
"
1609,Can atheism surpass Christianity in American black communities by 2021?,"To determine if atheism could surpass Christianity in American Black communities by 2021, we need to consider several factors: the existing religious landscape within these communities, the rate of religious switching or decline, and the potential growth of atheism.  Data on religious affiliation in the US is often collected through surveys which have inherent limitations in accuracy and may not capture the nuances of self-identification.  However, general trends suggest that Christianity remains the dominant religion among Black Americans, though the specific denominations and adherence levels vary.  While there may be some increase in non-religious identification among younger generations, it's unlikely to reach the point where atheism surpasses Christianity in such a short timeframe (by 2021).  Significant societal shifts and a dramatic change in religious practices would be needed for such a rapid transformation.  The available data and observable trends do not support this proposition.

1611,Is Autumn a good time to collect bear pelts in US?,"Answer: Black bears are hunted in many US states during autumn because this is the time of year when they are preparing for hibernation and their pelts are in prime condition.  However, this depends on specific state regulations and hunting seasons, which vary significantly.  Therefore, while autumn is *a* good time in some locations, it's not universally a good time to collect bear pelts across the entire US.

"
1612,Could Rich and Morty be triggered for children of alcoholics?,"The show Rick and Morty often depicts dysfunctional family relationships and explores themes of addiction and trauma.  Rick Sanchez, the main character, is an alcoholic scientist whose erratic behavior and poor decision-making significantly impact his family, including his grandson Morty.  While the show is not explicitly focused on the children of alcoholics, the depiction of a neglectful and alcoholic parent figure, coupled with the portrayal of the negative consequences on the family, could be triggering for viewers who have experienced similar situations.  The show's dark humor and often disturbing content would likely exacerbate these feelings.

Answer: {true}
"
1613,Do American wheelchair users know what the ADA is?,"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a landmark piece of legislation that prohibits discrimination based on disability.  Given the prevalence and impact of the ADA on the lives of wheelchair users in the United States, it's highly likely that most, if not all, American wheelchair users are aware of its existence and its significance to their rights and access.  However, the level of specific knowledge regarding the intricacies of the ADA might vary. While they may not know every detail of the law, awareness of the ADA's broad purpose and protections is likely widespread among this population.

Answer: {true}
"
1614,Is it difficult to conduct astrophotography in the summer in Sweden?,"Sweden experiences long summer days with minimal darkness. Astrophotography requires long exposure times to capture faint celestial objects, which is impossible or very difficult with limited nighttime hours.  The continuous twilight would also wash out the faint light from stars and galaxies. Therefore, conducting astrophotography during the summer in Sweden is challenging.

Answer: {true}
"
1615,Did Jane Austen suffer from middle child syndrome?,"Jane Austen was the second of seven children.  While middle child syndrome is a theory and not a clinically diagnosed condition, it suggests that middle children may experience feelings of being overlooked or overshadowed by older and younger siblings.  However, there's no evidence in her life or writings to suggest Jane Austen suffered from this, and any conclusions about her psychological state would be speculative.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say she suffered from middle child syndrome.


Answer: {false}
"
1616,Would Gomer Pyle salute a lieutenant?,"Gomer Pyle, a character known for his naivete and tendency to over-salute, would almost certainly salute a lieutenant.  Lieutenants are commissioned officers in the military, and saluting superior officers is standard military procedure.

Answer: {true}
"
1617,Can Herpes simplex virus spread on Venus?,"Herpes simplex virus is a virus that requires a host to replicate and survive.  Venus's surface environment is incredibly hostile to life as we know it, with extreme temperatures, a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, and a crushing atmospheric pressure.  There is no liquid water on the surface and no known life forms.  Therefore, the herpes simplex virus, which requires a biological host and suitable conditions, could not spread on Venus.

Answer: {false}
"
1618,Is Pig Latin related to real Latin?,"Pig Latin is a language game or argot, not a language related to the actual Latin language.  It involves manipulating the sounds of words according to specific rules, such as moving the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end and adding ""ay.""  There is no etymological or grammatical connection to Classical Latin.

Answer: {false}
"
1619,Would Matt Damon be afraid of parachuting?,"Matt Damon's portrayal of an astronaut in the movie ""The Martian"" involved a scene where his character had to use a parachute to descend to the Martian surface.  While the movie is fictional, it's plausible that the filming of such a scene might involve some level of fear or apprehension, even for an actor as skilled and adventurous as Matt Damon. While there's no public information confirming a fear of parachuting, the possibility exists.  However, it is unlikely that he is genuinely afraid based on available public information.  The question asks if he *would* be afraid, and the lack of evidence to support that does not make it certain.

Answer: {false}
"
1620,"During the pandemic, is door to door advertising considered inconsiderate?","Explanation: During the pandemic, many health organizations recommended social distancing and minimizing contact to curb the spread of the virus. Door-to-door advertising involves close proximity and physical contact with individuals, thus increasing the risk of transmission.  This direct interaction would be considered unsafe and inconsiderate, especially given the heightened health concerns during that period.

Answer: {true}
"
1621,Did Ivan the Terrible use the Byzantine calendar?,"Ivan the Terrible reigned from 1533 to 1584.  The Byzantine Empire fell in 1453. While the Byzantine calendar continued to be used in some parts of the world after the fall of the empire, it's highly unlikely that it would have been the primary calendar used in Russia during Ivan the Terrible's reign.  Russia, at that time, was transitioning to and largely using the Julian calendar, which was common throughout much of Europe. While some influence from Byzantium might have lingered in other areas, the widespread adoption of the Julian calendar in Russia makes it improbable that the Byzantine calendar was the primary calendar for official or common usage in Ivan the Terrible's time.

Answer: {false}
"
1622,Could a delicious recipe be made with The Onion?,"The Onion is a satirical news website, not a culinary ingredient.  While the name might suggest an actual onion, it's not a food item in this context.  Therefore, a delicious recipe cannot be made using ""The Onion"" in its intended meaning.

Answer: {false}
"
1623,Does The Doctor keep his ship in his childhood home?,"The provided context does not give information about where The Doctor keeps his ship.  The question refers to a fictional character from the television series *Doctor Who*, whose TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) is his time-traveling ship.  The show has never established that he keeps the TARDIS in his childhood home.  In fact, the location of the Doctor's childhood home is not consistently defined in the show's canon, and he travels through time and space, rarely staying in one place for long.

Answer: {false}
"
1624,Did Francois Mitterrand ever meet Barak Obama while they both held the position of President?,"François Mitterrand was the President of France from 1981 to 1995.  Barack Obama was the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.  Their presidencies overlapped for a period of time (2009-1995). However, there's no widely known or documented evidence suggesting they ever met during that overlap.  While it's *possible* a meeting occurred without public record, the lack of any such information makes it highly unlikely.

Answer: {false}
"
1625,Did Neanderthals use arithmetic?,"There is no definitive evidence that Neanderthals used arithmetic in the same way modern humans do. While they demonstrated advanced cognitive abilities, such as toolmaking and symbolic behavior, there's no archaeological evidence of them using numerals or performing calculations.  Their cognitive capacities might have allowed for some basic understanding of quantities, but this is different from formal arithmetic.  The lack of evidence suggests it's unlikely they possessed this skill.

Answer: {false}
"
1626,Is coal needed to practice parachuting?,"Coal is a fuel source used for energy generation and various industrial processes.  Parachuting, on the other hand, is an activity involving jumping from an aircraft and using a parachute to safely descend to the ground. There is no relationship between coal and the practice of parachuting.  The two are entirely unrelated.

Answer: {false}
"
1627,Is a watchmaker likely to be able to fix an Apple Watch?,"A watchmaker, by definition, is skilled in repairing and maintaining mechanical watches.  Apple Watches, however, are primarily electronic devices with a small number of mechanical parts. While a watchmaker might possess some transferable skills (e.g., fine motor skills, precision work), their expertise is not directly applicable to the complex electronics and software of an Apple Watch.  It's unlikely they would possess the specialized tools or knowledge needed for repair.  Therefore, a watchmaker is not likely to be able to fix an Apple Watch.

Answer: {false}

"
1630,Would Jacques Duèze have been friends with Richard Dawkins?,"Jacques Duèze is a fictional character created by the author Michel Houellebecq.  Richard Dawkins is a real, prominent evolutionary biologist and author known for his atheism and staunch criticism of religion. While there's no public information suggesting any interaction between them (as one is fictional and the other real), their potential friendship is unlikely given the very different natures of their existences.  The fictional character's attributes and relationships would be entirely within the bounds of the author's imagination, and  wouldn't necessarily align with the public persona and real-life relationships of Richard Dawkins.


Answer: {false}
"
1631,Can spiders help eggplant farmers control parasites?,"Spiders are natural predators of many insects.  Eggplant crops are susceptible to various insect pests that act as parasites, damaging the plants and reducing yield.  Certain spider species prey on these insects, thus potentially helping to control the pest population and protect the eggplant crop. Therefore, the use of spiders as a form of biological pest control in eggplant farming is plausible.

Answer: {true}
"
1632,Does butter industry survive cow extinction?,"The butter industry relies entirely on cows for its primary ingredient, butterfat.  If cows went extinct, there would be no source of butterfat to produce butter.  Therefore, the butter industry could not survive.

Answer: {false}
"
1633,Could a chipmunk fit 100 chocolate chips in his mouth?,"Answer: A chipmunk's mouth is relatively small.  While a chipmunk's cheek pouches can hold a surprising amount of food, it's highly unlikely that 100 chocolate chips, even small ones, could physically fit inside its mouth at once. The chips would likely spill out and get in the way of proper chewing and swallowing.

Answer: {false}
"
1634,Could all of the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day fit in Dorton Arena?,"To answer this question, we need to estimate the number of people who pass through 30th Street Station daily and the capacity of Dorton Arena.

* **30th Street Station Daily Passengers:**  30th Street Station is a major transportation hub.  A precise number of daily passengers is difficult to find publicly, but it likely handles tens of thousands of people daily. Let's conservatively estimate 50,000 people pass through the station each day.  This is likely a low estimate.

* **Dorton Arena Capacity:** Dorton Arena's capacity varies depending on the event configuration.  However, a reasonable upper bound for a densely packed standing-room-only scenario might be around 10,000 people. This is a generous estimate.  The arena is designed for seated events and its actual capacity would be lower for seated events.

**Comparison:**  Even with a conservative estimate of 50,000 daily passengers for 30th Street Station and a generous estimate of 10,000 capacity for Dorton Arena, the number of daily passengers far exceeds the arena's capacity.

"
1638,Is the most expensive color in the world Blue?,"The question asks if blue is the most expensive color in the world.  While there isn't a definitive ""most expensive color"" in a general sense, the pigment ultramarine, a deep blue, was historically very costly due to its source (lapis lazuli).  However, the cost of pigments is constantly shifting due to availability, processing techniques, and demand. Other colors, such as certain reds and yellows, have also historically commanded high prices. Therefore, while ultramarine blue held a significant price advantage for a long time, it's not necessarily the *most* expensive color definitively across all time and contexts.

Answer: {false}
"
1639,Was The Canterbury Tales written before One Thousand and One Nights?,"The Canterbury Tales were written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the late 14th century (1387-1400).  One Thousand and One Nights (also known as Arabian Nights) is a collection of stories with origins in medieval Arabic and Persian literature, though its current form developed over many centuries.  While precise dating is difficult for such a compilation, the core of One Thousand and One Nights is believed to have originated much earlier, spanning several centuries before Chaucer's time. Therefore, One Thousand and One Nights predates The Canterbury Tales.

Answer: {false}
"
1640,Is immersion in virtual reality testable on cnidarians before humans?,"Cnidarians, such as jellyfish and sea anemones, possess a simple nervous system, lacking the complex brain structures found in humans.  Their sensory perception and behavioral responses are fundamentally different from those of humans. While it's possible to study their reactions to stimuli in a controlled environment, applying virtual reality (VR) technology, which relies on sophisticated visual and sensory processing, would be impractical and likely ineffective.  The technology designed for human VR would be completely inappropriate for cnidarians, who lack the necessary sensory organs and cognitive capacity to interact with or even perceive a virtual environment.  Therefore, testing the effects of VR immersion on cnidarians before humans is not feasible.

Answer: {false}
"
1641,Could Little Women have been a book read by veterans of the civil war?,"Little Women was published in 1868 and 1869. The American Civil War ended in 1865.  Therefore, veterans of the Civil War would have been alive and could have read the book.

Answer: {true}
"
1642,Will a sloth explode if it's not upside down?,"Sloths are known for their upside-down posture in trees, but this is a preference related to their lifestyle, not a physiological necessity.  Their bodies are not structured in a way that would cause them to explode if they weren't hanging upside down.  They can and do move around and rest in other positions.

Answer: {false}
"
1643,Would a birdwatcher pursue their hobby at a Philadelphia Eagles game?,"A birdwatcher's hobby centers around observing birds in their natural habitat or other locations where birds are present.  A Philadelphia Eagles game is a sporting event held in a stadium, and while birds may be present, it is not a primary location or environment for birdwatching. The focus of a football game is on the game itself, not bird observation.  Therefore, while a birdwatcher *might* incidentally see a bird, it's not a location where they'd actively pursue their hobby.

Answer: {false}
"
1644,Would a fungal life-form be threatened by a pigment from copper?,"Copper is a heavy metal, and many heavy metals are toxic to fungi.  Copper ions can disrupt fungal cellular processes, including enzyme function and membrane integrity.  Pigments derived from copper compounds would likely retain some toxicity, although the level of toxicity would depend on the specific pigment and its concentration. Therefore, a fungal life-form could be threatened by a pigment from copper.

Answer: {true}
"
1645,Does the land in close proximity to beaver dams suffer?,"Beaver dams alter the flow of water, causing flooding in some areas and drought in others.  The flooded areas can kill trees and other vegetation, while the drier areas can experience reduced water availability for plants.  Furthermore, the changes to water flow can affect the entire ecosystem, impacting the types and numbers of plants and animals that can thrive in the area. Therefore, land in close proximity to beaver dams experiences negative consequences.

Answer: {true}
"
1646,Could Quartz be useful to humans if plants died off and there was no oxygen?,"Quartz itself cannot produce oxygen.  Plants, through photosynthesis, are responsible for the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.  If all plants died off, there would be no significant source of oxygen replenishment, rendering quartz useless in terms of providing breathable oxygen.  While quartz has many industrial and technological applications, it doesn't possess any properties that would help humans survive in a completely oxygen-deprived environment.

Answer: {false}
"
1647,Is the Illuminati card game still popular?,"The popularity of the Illuminati card game has fluctuated over time.  While it enjoyed a period of significant popularity after its release in the 1980s, fueled by conspiracy theories surrounding its themes, its current popularity is difficult to definitively quantify.  Sales figures aren't consistently publicly available, and its popularity is likely more niche than mainstream.  While it maintains a dedicated following and is still available for purchase,  it's not a game regularly topping sales charts or enjoying widespread mainstream recognition in the same way it might have in its heyday.  Therefore, while it is still played and sold, declaring it ""popular"" in a broad sense is inaccurate.

Answer: {false}
"
1648,Can I hold Bing in a basket?,"The question ""Can I hold Bing in a basket?"" is asking whether the large language model, Bing, can be physically held in a basket.  Bing is a computer program; it does not have a physical body.  Therefore, it cannot be held in a basket.

Answer: {false}
"
1649,Was the Parc des Princes fully operational during June of 2020?,"Answer: The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread lockdowns and restrictions on public gatherings in the spring and summer of 2020.  Major sporting events, including football matches, were postponed or canceled. The Parc des Princes, a major football stadium in Paris, would likely have been subject to these restrictions, meaning it wouldn't have been fully operational in the sense of hosting large crowds for matches in June 2020.

Answer: {false}
"
1650,Will Chick-fil-A hypothetically refuse to sponsor a Pride parade?,"Chick-fil-A has a history of donating to organizations opposed to same-sex marriage.  Their public statements have been ambiguous regarding LGBTQ+ rights, but their actions suggest a lack of support for the LGBTQ+ community.  A Pride parade celebrates LGBTQ+ pride and rights, and therefore it's highly probable that Chick-fil-A would refuse to sponsor such an event, given their past actions and associations.

1652,Did Jon Brower Minnoch suffer from anorexia nervosa?,"Jon Brower Minnoch suffered from extreme obesity, not anorexia nervosa.  Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a significantly low body weight, usually resulting from self-starvation.  Minnoch's condition was the opposite; he was severely obese, weighing over 1,400 pounds at his peak.  Therefore, he did not suffer from anorexia nervosa.

"
1654,Is Phobos (moon) name origin similar to Roman god Pavor?,"Phobos, one of Mars' moons, is named after the Greek god of fear, Phobos.  Pavor is the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Phobos.  Therefore, the name origins are similar, drawing from the same mythological figure representing fear.

Answer: {true}
"
1655,Would a snake have reasons to fear a honey badger?,"Honey badgers are known for their fierce aggression and tenacity, attacking animals much larger than themselves.  They have thick skin and are incredibly resilient to bites and stings. Snakes, while possessing venom in many cases, are vulnerable to a honey badger's powerful jaws and claws.  A honey badger would likely be able to kill and consume a snake.

Answer: {true}
"
1656,Are honey badgers and hyenas anatomically dissimilar?,"Honey badgers and hyenas, while both formidable predators, belong to different taxonomic families and exhibit significant anatomical differences.  Honey badgers are mustelids, related to weasels and otters, possessing a long, slender body, short legs, and powerful claws adapted for digging and fighting.  Hyenas, on the other hand, are more closely related to cats and belong to the family Hyaenidae. They have a stockier build, powerful jaws, and strong teeth specialized for crushing bones. Their legs are longer and better adapted for running.  These differences in body shape, limb structure, dentition, and overall skeletal features clearly demonstrate significant anatomical dissimilarities.

Answer: {true}
"
1657,Was Noah concerned with buoyancy?,"Noah's ark, as described in the biblical story, needed to float and carry a large number of animals and supplies.  The ability of the ark to float is directly related to its buoyancy – the upward force exerted on it by the water.  Therefore, Noah would have been, implicitly if not explicitly, concerned with the buoyancy of his ark to ensure its survival and the successful completion of his mission.

Answer: {true}
"
1658,Is the Muslim world hostile to Israel?,"Answer:  The relationship between the Muslim world and Israel is complex and multifaceted, varying greatly depending on the specific country and its political context.  While some Muslim-majority countries have normalized relations with Israel, others maintain strong opposition due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Israel's policies towards Palestinians.  There is no single, unified stance of the ""Muslim world"" towards Israel;  hostility exists in some areas, while neutrality or even cooperation exists in others.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to characterize the entire Muslim world as uniformly hostile to Israel.

Answer: {false}
"
1659,Did Kim Il-sung network on LinkedIn?,"Kim Il-sung was the Supreme Leader of North Korea from 1948 until his death in 1994.  LinkedIn is a professional networking site that did not exist until December 2002.  Therefore, it would have been impossible for Kim Il-sung to have a LinkedIn account.

1661,Could the Jackson 5 play a full game of rugby with each other?,"The Jackson 5 consisted of five brothers: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael.  A full rugby team requires 15 players.  Therefore, the Jackson 5 would not have enough members to play a full game of rugby.

Answer: {false}
"
1662,Does the human stomach destroy a bee if ingested?,"The human stomach is a highly acidic environment.  The stomach's strong hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes are designed to break down food.  A bee's exoskeleton is relatively tough, but it's unlikely to withstand the harsh conditions of the stomach for long. The acid would likely dissolve the bee's chitinous exoskeleton, and the enzymes would break down its soft tissues. While a whole bee might not be completely digested immediately, the stomach's powerful digestive processes would effectively destroy it.

Answer: {true}
"
1663,Would Elon Musk be more likely to know about astrology than physics?,"Elon Musk is known for his involvement in advanced technological fields like aerospace engineering and artificial intelligence, both of which heavily rely on a strong understanding of physics.  While his interests may be diverse, his public persona and professional achievements strongly suggest a deeper understanding of physics than astrology.  Therefore, it's more likely he possesses greater knowledge of physics.

1664,Does Coast to Coast AM have more longevity than the Rush Limbaugh show?,"Coast to Coast AM debuted in 1988 and is still currently running.  Rush Limbaugh's radio show began in 1988 and ended with his death in 2021.  Therefore, Coast to Coast AM has had a longer run.

Answer: {true}
"
1665,Are eagles and young bears both used as labels for skills-training youth groups?,"Explanation:
The question asks if both eagles and young bears are used as labels for skills-training youth groups.  There's no widely known, standardized naming convention for youth groups that uses ""eagles"" and ""young bears"" in this way. While individual groups might use animal names as mascots or identifiers, there's no evidence to suggest this is a common practice with these specific animals.  Therefore, the answer is likely false.

Answer: {false}
"
1666,Can parachuting amateurs ignore hurricane force winds bulletins?,"Explanation: Hurricane force winds present a significant danger to anyone, especially those who lack the experience and training to handle such conditions. Parachuting requires a certain level of skill and precision, and strong winds can easily disrupt a parachute's deployment and create dangerous situations.  Ignoring hurricane force wind bulletins would be extremely reckless and potentially fatal for amateur parachutists.

Answer: {false}
"
1667,Should wool be hand washed only?,"Wool garments are delicate and can be damaged by harsh washing methods.  While some wool items *can* be machine washed on a gentle cycle with a wool-specific detergent, hand washing is generally recommended to prevent shrinking, felting (matting of the fibers), and damage to the garment's structure. Hand washing allows for greater control over the process and minimizes the risk of these problems.  Therefore, while not *always* necessary, hand washing is often the preferred method for preserving the quality and longevity of wool items.

Answer: {true}
"
1668,Do most people only memorize slightly over half of their ZIP code?,"The typical ZIP code in the United States has five digits.  Most people would likely remember the first few digits of their ZIP code more readily than the last few, which are often less frequently used or encountered in everyday life.  While there's no definitive data on exactly how many digits people remember, it's plausible that many only reliably recall slightly more than half – perhaps three digits –  especially if their recall is prompted without seeing the full code.  Complete memorization of all five digits is common, but imperfect recall of the latter part of the code is plausible.

Answer: {true}
"
1669,Does the history of Europe include the age of dinosaurs?,"The age of dinosaurs ended approximately 66 million years ago with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.  The earliest evidence of humans in Europe dates back only to around 1.2 million years ago.  Therefore, the history of Europe, as understood in terms of human history and civilization, does not include the age of dinosaurs. The dinosaur age predates human history in Europe by a vast margin.

Answer: {false}
"
1670,Was Florence Nightingale's death more painful than Saint Peter's?,"Florence Nightingale died peacefully in her sleep at age 90.  Saint Peter, a biblical figure, died by crucifixion, a notoriously painful method of execution.  Therefore, Saint Peter's death was almost certainly more painful than Florence Nightingale's.

Answer: {false}
"
1671,Could a firewall be destroyed by a hammer?,"Answer: A firewall, in the context of computer networking, is a software program or hardware device that prevents unauthorized access to a computer network.  A physical hammer could not destroy a software firewall.  A hardware firewall is a physical device, and while a hammer *could* physically damage it, rendering it inoperable, this isn't a guaranteed outcome and depends on the construction of the firewall and the force of the blow. However, the question implies the destruction of the firewall's function, not necessarily its physical destruction. Therefore, while a hammer might damage a hardware firewall, it is unlikely to be a completely effective way to destroy its functionality as a firewall in all cases.

Answer: {false}
"
1672,If Martin Luther did one theses a day would he run out in half a year?,"Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses were published in 1517.  There are 95 theses. Half a year is approximately 180 days. If he wrote one thesis per day, he would not run out in half a year, as he would only have written 180 theses.

1675,Do inanimate objects come alive in Beauty and the Beast?,"The movie ""Beauty and the Beast"" features a cursed prince who transforms into a beast, and the enchanted objects in his castle also transform into living beings.  This includes the candlestick (Lumière), the clock (Cogsworth), the teapot (Mrs. Potts), and others. Therefore, inanimate objects do come alive in the story.

Answer: {true}
"
1676,Can bottlenose dolphins hypothetically outbreed human women?,"Here's an explanation to determine if bottlenose dolphins could hypothetically outbreed human women:

To answer this question, we need to consider several factors:

* **Reproductive Rate:** Bottlenose dolphins have a longer gestation period and lower reproductive rate than humans.  Female dolphins typically give birth to a single calf every 2-3 years.  Human women, depending on various factors, can have a child potentially every year or two if they choose to.

* **Lifespan:** Bottlenose dolphins have a longer lifespan than humans, but this doesn't directly translate to a higher overall number of offspring in their lifetimes.  

* **Population Size:** The current global human population far exceeds the global bottlenose dolphin population.

While individual female dolphins could potentially have a higher number of offspring in their lifetime *compared to the average human woman*, the sheer number of human women and the overall rate of human reproduction dwarf the capacity of dolphins to outbreed humans. Therefore, the statement that bottlenose dolphins could *hypothetically* outbreed human women is false.

Answer: {false}
"
1677,Could Scooby Doo fit in a kangaroo pouch?,"Answer: A kangaroo pouch's size varies depending on the species of kangaroo, but generally, they are not large enough to comfortably fit a dog the size of Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo is depicted as a Great Dane, a large breed of dog.  Even smaller kangaroos have pouches that are only big enough for their joeys, which are much smaller than a Great Dane puppy, let alone a fully grown one. Therefore, Scooby Doo would not fit.

1679,Would stargazers prefer binoculars over a telescope?,"Stargazers might prefer binoculars over a telescope depending on their needs and priorities.  Binoculars offer a wider field of view, making it easier to locate objects in the night sky. They are also generally more portable and less expensive than telescopes.  However, telescopes offer significantly greater magnification and resolving power, allowing for much more detailed observation of celestial objects.  Therefore, there's no single preference; the best choice depends on the observer's goals (wide-field viewing versus detailed observation) and budget.

1681,Can a person be diagnosed with a Great Depression?,"The term ""Great Depression"" refers to the severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929.  It is a historical event, not a diagnosable medical condition. While individuals may experience depression during times of economic hardship, and the severity of this depression can be clinically significant, the term ""Great Depression"" itself is not a clinical diagnosis.  A mental health professional would diagnose a person with a specific mental health disorder, such as major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or adjustment disorder with depressed mood,  based on specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Answer: {false}
"
1682,Would only warm weather attire be a good idea on Mercury?,"Mercury's surface temperature fluctuates wildly.  While it can reach extremely high temperatures during the day, it also experiences extremely low temperatures at night.  Therefore, packing only warm-weather attire would be incredibly dangerous and likely fatal.  A spacesuit is required for survival on Mercury, not just clothing appropriate for warm weather.

"
1684,Would a recruit for the United States Marine Corps be turned away for self harm?,"The United States Marine Corps has strict physical and mental health standards for recruits.  Self-harm is a serious indicator of underlying mental health issues, and individuals with a history of self-harm would likely be deemed unfit for service.  The Marine Corps prioritizes the physical and mental well-being of its recruits and personnel, and a history of self-harm would raise significant concerns about a recruit's ability to withstand the rigorous demands of training and service.  Therefore, a recruit exhibiting a history of self-harm would likely be turned away.

1687,Are some chiropractic manipulations dangerous?,"Chiropractic manipulations involve adjusting the spine and other joints. While often effective for pain relief, some manipulations carry inherent risks, particularly if performed improperly or on individuals with certain conditions.  These risks can include, but are not limited to:  stroke (though the causal link is debated and considered rare), vertebral artery dissection, nerve damage, and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.  The potential for harm varies depending on the specific technique used, the patient's health status, and the skill of the chiropractor.  Therefore, the answer is yes, some chiropractic manipulations are dangerous.

"
1688,Is Olivia Newton-John hyphenated celebrity name with most letters?,"Olivia Newton-John's full name has 21 letters.  To determine if it's the celebrity name with the most letters, we'd need to compare it to many other hyphenated celebrity names. However, it's highly unlikely a simple comparison would be sufficient to reach a definitive answer.  There are thousands of celebrities, and finding a comprehensive list of all hyphenated names and their lengths would be an extensive task beyond the scope of this response.  Therefore, we cannot definitively confirm or deny whether Olivia Newton-John's name has the most letters among all hyphenated celebrity names.

Answer: {false}
"
1689,Is Casio's founding year a composite number?,"Casio was founded in 1946.  A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.  1946 is an even number greater than 2, therefore it is divisible by 2, and thus has divisors other than 1 and itself.  Therefore, 1946 is a composite number.

1694,Are any of J.K. Rowling's books in the genre of And Then There Were None?,"J.K. Rowling is best known for her Harry Potter series, which falls into the fantasy genre.  Agatha Christie's *And Then There Were None* is a mystery novel, specifically a whodunit with a locked-room mystery element.  While Rowling has written other books besides the Harry Potter series, none of them share the characteristics of a classic whodunit mystery novel like *And Then There Were None*.  Her works generally fall into the fantasy, children's literature, or adult fiction genres, but not the mystery genre exemplified by Christie's work.

1697,Do people watching Coen brothers films in Guinea Bissau need subtitles?,"Explanation: The question asks whether people in Guinea-Bissau would need subtitles to watch Coen brothers films.  To answer this, we need to consider the official language(s) of Guinea-Bissau and the language(s) in which Coen brothers films are typically released.  Guinea-Bissau's official languages are Portuguese and Crioulo.  Coen brothers films are typically released in English.  Since neither Portuguese nor Crioulo is English, viewers in Guinea-Bissau would likely need subtitles to understand the dialogue.

"
1700,Are the Vietnamese people a great untapped resource for NBA players?,"Explanation:
There is no readily available data suggesting that Vietnamese people possess any inherent physical or athletic characteristics that would make them disproportionately likely to excel in the NBA compared to other populations.  While individual talent exists everywhere, the NBA's player pool is primarily drawn from established basketball powerhouses in the United States and other countries with strong basketball traditions and extensive youth development programs.  Vietnam does not currently have a developed basketball infrastructure comparable to these nations.  Therefore, suggesting they are a ""great untapped resource"" is unfounded and relies on an unsubstantiated assumption.

1703,Do calico cat patterns cover every drain fly color variety?,"Calico cat patterns are a result of random X chromosome inactivation in female cats with a particular gene combination.  The color variations in calico cats are typically orange, black, and white, although other colors can be involved.  Drain flies, on the other hand, exhibit a range of colors, often shades of gray, brown, and black, but not typically orange.  The color patterns of calico cats are completely unrelated to the color variations of drain flies. Therefore, the calico cat patterns do not cover every drain fly color variety.

Answer: {false}
"
1704,Is the Golden eagle considered a scavenger bird?,"The golden eagle is a large bird of prey known for its hunting prowess.  While it might occasionally feed on carrion (dead animals) if readily available, its primary food source is live prey such as rabbits, hares, and other small mammals. Scavenger birds, by definition, primarily rely on carrion for sustenance.  Therefore, while a golden eagle might opportunistically scavenge, it is not considered a scavenger bird.

Answer: {false}
"
1705,Would you spend less on your food at Aldi than at Whole Foods?,"Aldi is a discount grocery store known for its low prices, while Whole Foods is a premium grocery store with significantly higher prices.  Therefore, one would expect to spend less on groceries at Aldi than at Whole Foods.

1713,Is pickled cucumber ever red?,"Pickled cucumbers, also known as pickles, are typically green or sometimes yellow-green depending on the variety of cucumber and the pickling process.  However, there are instances where pickled cucumbers can appear red. This is usually achieved through the addition of red food coloring or by pickling them in beetroot juice which imparts a reddish hue.  Therefore, while not the norm, it's possible for pickled cucumbers to be red.

Answer: {true}
"
1714,Does coding rely on Boolean algebra characters?,"Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra dealing with logical operations and their relationships.  These operations are represented by symbols (characters) like AND, OR, NOT, often represented with symbols like  &, |, and ¬ (or !).  These Boolean operators are fundamental to computer logic and how computers process information.  Coding, at its core, relies on these logical operations to control the flow of a program, make decisions based on conditions, and manipulate data. Therefore, coding inherently relies on Boolean algebra characters.

Answer: {true}
"
1715,Are there people who are men who experience menstruation?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:  Menstruation is a biological process tied to the female reproductive system.  While trans men may have uteruses and ovaries before transitioning, and therefore may have menstruated in the past,  men who have completed male puberty and do not have a functioning female reproductive system cannot menstruate.  The term ""menstruation"" specifically refers to the shedding of the uterine lining, a process that requires functional female reproductive organs.
"
1716,"Can I ski in Steamboat Springs, Colorado in August?","Steamboat Springs, Colorado is a ski resort, and ski resorts typically operate during the winter months when there is sufficient snow.

"
1718,Are months based on the solar cycle?,"Months are not directly based on the solar cycle in the sense that their lengths aren't precisely determined by the Earth's orbit around the Sun.  The solar year is approximately 365.242 days long.  Our calendar attempts to approximate this, but the lengths of months are largely a matter of historical convention and cultural practice, with variations across different calendars and cultures. Some months have 30 days, others have 31, and February has a variable number of days. While the overall calendar attempts to track the solar year, the individual month lengths are not directly derived from solar cycles.

"
1722,Can a human heart last from NYC to Raleigh NC by Toyota Hiux?,"The question asks if a human heart could last in transit from New York City to Raleigh, North Carolina, transported in a Toyota Hilux.  This depends on several factors:

* **Distance and Travel Time:** The distance between NYC and Raleigh is significant, requiring several hours of driving.  The longer the travel time, the greater the risk to the heart's viability.
* **Temperature Control:**  A human heart needs to be kept at a very specific temperature for preservation.  A Toyota Hilux is not equipped with specialized temperature-controlled containers typically used for organ transport.
* **Specialized Equipment:**  Organ transport requires specialized equipment to maintain the heart's viability, including cooling systems, monitoring devices, and possibly perfusion to keep it alive.  A Toyota Hilux lacks this equipment.


Therefore, it is highly improbable that a human heart could survive a journey from NYC to Raleigh NC in a standard Toyota Hilux without specialized preservation and transport equipment.

Answer: {false}
"
1723,Is watermelon safe for people with a tricarboxylic acid allergy?,"Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a metabolic pathway that breaks down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to produce energy.  Watermelon does not contain TCA cycle components in a form that would trigger an allergic reaction in someone with a TCA cycle allergy.  A TCA cycle allergy is not a typical food allergy; it's more likely a reference to issues with metabolic processes related to the TCA cycle, not a direct food allergy.  Therefore, a watermelon allergy is unlikely related to a TCA cycle issue.  Even if there were some metabolic interaction, the quantities of relevant components in watermelon are likely far too small to cause a reaction.

Answer: {true}
"
1724,Is shrimp prevalent in Ethiopian cuisine?,"Ethiopian cuisine is largely vegetarian, focusing on grains, legumes, and vegetables.  While seafood isn't entirely absent from Ethiopian cooking, it's extremely uncommon and not a prevalent ingredient due to Ethiopia's landlocked geography.  Shrimp, in particular, would be highly unusual.

"
1726,Would a snakebite hypothetically be a threat to T-1000?,"Answer: The T-1000 is a fictional character from the Terminator film franchise.  It is a Terminator model made of liquid metal, capable of shapeshifting and self-repair.  A snakebite would not be able to penetrate its liquid metal form and cause any damage.  Therefore, a snakebite would not be a threat to the T-1000.

Answer: {false}
"
1727,Could a white belt defeat Jon Jones in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu match?,"Jon Jones is a highly accomplished mixed martial artist with extensive experience in various martial arts, including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).  He's known for his exceptional skills and athleticism.  A white belt in BJJ represents a beginner with very limited training and experience.  The skill disparity is immense.  Therefore, it's highly improbable, bordering on impossible, that a white belt could defeat Jon Jones in a BJJ match.

Answer: {false}
"
1728,Does Darth Vader's character resemble Severus Snape?,"Answer: Both Darth Vader and Severus Snape are complex characters with initially hidden, conflicted loyalties.  Both are initially presented as antagonists, wielding considerable power and appearing ruthless.  However, both eventually reveal deeper motivations and a surprising degree of self-sacrifice driven by love and a desire for redemption (though to varying degrees and with vastly different outcomes).  While their methods and contexts are dramatically different, the underlying arc of a seemingly villainous character displaying surprising depths of loyalty and selflessness is a commonality.

Answer: {true}
"
1729,Were weather phenomena avoided when naming minor league baseball teams?,"Minor league baseball teams often use names that evoke their location, history, or local culture.  While some names might indirectly reference weather (e.g., a team named ""Thunder,""  ""Storm,"" or ""Suns""), the naming conventions don't systematically avoid weather phenomena.  Many teams use weather-related names without issue.

Answer: {false}
"
1730,Did Johann Sebastian Bach influence heavy metal?,"Johann Sebastian Bach's music, while complex and highly structured, is generally considered to be Baroque in style.  Heavy metal emerged much later and has vastly different characteristics, including distorted guitars, aggressive vocals, and a focus on themes of rebellion and darkness. While some composers might draw inspiration from earlier eras, there's no direct lineage or significant influence demonstrable between Bach's baroque compositions and the development of heavy metal.  There's no evidence suggesting heavy metal bands consciously incorporated Bach's work into their music in a way that significantly impacted the genre's development.

Answer: {false}
"
1731,Can a cheetah generate enough force to topple Big Show?,"Here's an analysis to determine if a cheetah could generate enough force to topple The Big Show:

**Factors to Consider:**

* **Cheetah's Force:**  Cheetahs are incredibly fast and agile, but their force is primarily directed towards forward momentum.  They don't have the mass or build to deliver a powerful, sustained impact like a much larger animal. Their bite force is also not exceptionally high compared to other predators.  Their primary hunting strategy relies on speed and surprise to knock down prey.

* **Big Show's Mass and Stability:**  The Big Show (Paul Wight) is a professional wrestler known for his enormous size and weight (around 400+ lbs).  His sheer mass gives him significant stability.  He's trained to withstand considerable force.

* **Type of Impact:** A cheetah's impact would likely be a glancing blow, a short burst of force from its body hitting The Big Show.  It wouldn't be a sustained push or a direct, concentrated hit.

**Conclusion:**

It's highly unlikely a cheetah could generate enough force to topple The Big Show. The Big Show's massive weight and stability, coupled with the limited force a cheetah can deliver in a single impact, make this scenario extremely improbable. The cheetah would likely be injured in the attempt.

Answer: {false}
"
1732,Are paratroopers good at mountain rescue?,"Paratroopers receive extensive training in airborne operations, including parachute jumps, navigation, and survival skills.  While this training doesn't directly equate to mountain rescue expertise, the skills are transferable.  Their experience with high-altitude operations, rappelling, and wilderness survival makes them potentially well-suited to certain aspects of mountain rescue.  However, specialized mountain rescue teams typically undergo more focused training in mountaineering techniques, rope rescue, and high-altitude medicine.  Therefore, while paratroopers might possess some relevant skills, they would likely not be as effective or specialized as dedicated mountain rescue teams.

Answer: {false}
"
1733,Did any cultures associate celery with death?,"Ancient Egyptians associated celery with death and mourning.

Answer: {true}
"
1734,Was Woodrow Wilson sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party?,"Woodrow Wilson (Democrat) was preceded by William Howard Taft (Republican) and succeeded by Warren G. Harding (Republican).  Therefore, he was indeed sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party.

Answer: {true}
"
1735,"Were there under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965?","Answer: The peak number of US troops in Vietnam was reached in 1968 and 1969.  In 1965, the number of troops was significantly lower than the peak. While exact numbers fluctuate throughout the year, it's highly unlikely that the number of US troops in Vietnam in 1965 exceeded 150,000.  Therefore, the statement ""Were there under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965?"" is likely true.

Answer: {true}
"
1736,Would a thesis paper be unusual to assign to kindergartners?,"A thesis paper is a long-form research and argumentative essay typically associated with advanced academic work, such as undergraduate or graduate studies.  It requires a high level of critical thinking, research skills, writing proficiency, and source citation.  Kindergartners lack the cognitive development, literacy skills, and research capabilities to undertake such a complex task.  Therefore, assigning a thesis paper to kindergartners would be highly unusual and inappropriate.

Answer: {false}
"
1737,Would John the Baptist be invited to a hypothetical cephalophore reunion in heaven?,"John the Baptist was beheaded, meaning his head was separated from his body.  A cephalophore is a saint depicted in art and religious tradition carrying their own severed head.  Since John the Baptist fits this description, he would be a likely invitee to a cephalophore reunion.

Answer: {true}
"
1738,Did the Wehrmacht affect the outcome of the War to End All Wars?,"The ""War to End All Wars"" is another name for World War I.  The Wehrmacht was the armed forces of Nazi Germany, and it did not exist during World War I.  The Wehrmacht was formed in 1935, long after the end of World War I.  Therefore, the Wehrmacht could not have affected the outcome of World War I.

"
1739,Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?,"Lil Wayne was born on September 27, 1982.  The minimum driving age in Louisiana, where he is from, is 16 years old.  To determine if he could legally operate a vehicle at the beginning of his career, we need to know when his career began.  While he gained popularity later, he started recording music in his early teens, making it unlikely he would have been 16 or older at that time.

Answer: {false}
"
1740,Was Lord Voldemort taught by Professor Dumbledore?,"Answer: Lord Voldemort, whose real name is Tom Riddle, was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Albus Dumbledore was the Headmaster of Hogwarts during Tom Riddle's time there.  While Dumbledore didn't directly teach all of Riddle's classes, he was the Headmaster and held ultimate authority over the school and the students.  Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Dumbledore was responsible for overseeing Riddle's education and implicitly involved in his teaching, even if he didn't teach him personally every subject.

Answer: {true}
"
1741,Does Olympia Washington share name with Hephaestus's workshop location?,"Hephaestus's workshop was located on Mount Olympus.  Olympia, Washington is named after the site of the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, also on Mount Olympus.  Therefore, both places share a name derived from the same mountain, although not directly from the name of Hephaestus's workshop itself.

Answer: {true}
"
1744,Did the Watergate scandal help the Republican party?,"The Watergate scandal, a major political scandal in the United States, involved the abuse of power by President Richard Nixon and his administration.  The scandal led to Nixon's resignation and a deep erosion of public trust in the Republican party.  While some might argue that the scandal ultimately led to reforms and a renewed focus on ethics in government, the immediate and long-term impact was overwhelmingly negative for the Republican party.  It resulted in significant electoral losses for the party and damaged its reputation for years to come.

Answer: {false}
"
1745,Did the original lead guitarist of Metallica fail after parting from the band?,"Dave Mustaine, the original lead guitarist of Metallica, was fired from the band in 1983.

"
1749,Can black swan's formation type help spell longest word in Dictionary?,"The question asks if the formation type of a black swan's flock could be used to spell the longest word in the dictionary.  This question is nonsensical.  Black swan formations are not letter formations, and there's no known longest word in the dictionary (the length of the ""longest word"" depends on the dictionary and inclusion criteria).  Even if there were a longest word, its length and letter arrangement are irrelevant to the shape of a flock of birds.

1750,Does the name C-SPAN refer to a form of telecommunications that utilizes outer space?,"C-SPAN stands for Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network.  While ""satellite"" is part of the name, suggesting a connection to outer space, the name refers to the use of satellites as a *means* of broadcasting, not as the defining characteristic of the telecommunications system itself. C-SPAN uses satellites to transmit its programming, but the core function is cable television broadcasting, not outer space communication in a fundamental or defining way.  Therefore, the name doesn't refer to a form of telecommunication *that utilizes* outer space, but rather *that utilizes a technology which is transmitted via* outer space.

"
1751,Would Kelly Clarkson's voice shake glass?,"Answer: Kelly Clarkson is known for her powerful voice.  While it's not scientifically proven that a voice can shake glass, extremely powerful sounds, such as those produced by opera singers shattering glass, is a known phenomenon. This requires specific frequencies and volume, and while it's unlikely Kelly Clarkson's voice is powerful enough to achieve this feat consistently, the possibility cannot be completely ruled out.  The power of her voice is certainly impressive, but it's unlikely she possesses the precise vocal control and intensity needed to reliably break glass.

Answer: {false}
"
1752,Does Santa Claus hypothetically give Joffrey Baratheon presents?,"Answer: Santa Claus is a fictional character who is believed to give presents to well-behaved children. Joffrey Baratheon is a fictional character from the series A Song of Ice and Fire who is known for his cruelty and tyranny.  It is unlikely that Santa Claus, a benevolent figure, would give presents to such a character.

Answer: {false}
"
1756,Is a northern fur seal needing emergency surgery in July likely a safe anesthesia candidate?,"Northern fur seals are susceptible to a condition called ""seal cough"" which is a respiratory disease, often complicated by pneumonia.  This condition, prevalent in July when many seals are molting, can significantly compromise respiratory function. Anesthesia carries inherent risks of respiratory depression, making it a potentially dangerous procedure for a seal already struggling with respiratory issues.  Considering the already weakened respiratory state a seal with ""seal cough"" might be in, proceeding with surgery under anesthesia would pose a significant risk.

Answer: {false}
"
1757,"Does Orange County, California require airplanes to be quiet?","Orange County, California, like many other areas, has noise ordinances related to aircraft.  However, these ordinances don't necessarily make airplanes ""quiet,"" but rather regulate the noise levels to acceptable limits.  They aim to mitigate the impact of aircraft noise on residents, but don't eliminate it entirely.  The specifics of noise regulations vary depending on the area and airport involved.  Therefore, while Orange County has noise regulations for airplanes, it doesn't explicitly require them to be quiet in the absolute sense.

Answer: {false}
"
1758,Was Charlemagne's father instrumental in outcome of the Battle of Tours?,"Charlemagne's father was Pepin the Short.  The Battle of Tours (also called the Battle of Poitiers) was fought in 732 AD. Pepin the Short became King of the Franks in 751 AD.  Therefore, Pepin the Short could not have been instrumental in the outcome of the Battle of Tours as he wasn't even king at the time.

Answer: {true}
"
1761,Is strep throat harmless to singer Rita Ora after her 2020 tonsilitis surgery?,"Rita Ora's 2020 tonsilitis surgery likely removed her tonsils. Strep throat is an infection of the tonsils.  Therefore, while strep throat can be treated with antibiotics,  having her tonsils removed would eliminate the tissue strep throat would typically infect.  This significantly reduces the risk of strep throat complications for Rita Ora post-surgery.

Answer: {true}
"
1762,Could William Franklyn-Miller win a 2020 Nascar Cup Series race?,"William Franklyn-Miller is an Australian actor and model.  He is not a NASCAR driver and therefore would not be able to win a NASCAR Cup Series race.

Answer: {false}
"
1763,Could the Powepuff Girls make the background to the Azerbaijani flag?,"The Azerbaijani flag is a horizontal tricolor of blue, red, and green.  The Powerpuff Girls are cartoon characters, and their depiction would not inherently relate to or replace the colors and design elements of the Azerbaijani flag.  Therefore, the Powerpuff Girls cannot *make* the background of the Azerbaijani flag; they can only be depicted *on* or *in front of* it, but they wouldn't change the flag itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1764,Was Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena hypothetically inadequate for hosting Coachella?,"The Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena is a relatively small indoor venue compared to the massive outdoor space required for a festival like Coachella. Coachella requires vast space for multiple stages, large crowds, camping areas, vendor booths, and parking.  The Memorial Sports Arena simply lacks the capacity and suitable infrastructure to accommodate the scale of Coachella.

1765,Did Moon Jae-in earn the Abitur as a teenager?,"Moon Jae-in's biography doesn't mention him earning the Abitur. The Abitur is a German university-entrance qualification.  While Moon Jae-in was educated in South Korea,  he wouldn't have pursued or obtained the Abitur.  Therefore, the statement is false.

Answer: {false}
"
1766,Would Bandy be likely to become popular in Texas?,"Bandy is a field hockey-like sport played on ice.  Its popularity is largely confined to certain regions of Scandinavia and some parts of Europe.  Texas, on the other hand, has a strong culture around sports like football, baseball, basketball, and even hockey (on ice).  These sports have established leagues, fan bases, and infrastructure.  The climate in Texas is also not particularly conducive to outdoor winter sports, which would be a necessary condition for the widespread adoption of bandy.  There's no existing infrastructure or cultural predisposition for bandy in Texas.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely to gain popularity.

Answer: {false}
"
1767,Can Curiosity take samples of rocks from Lacus Temporis?,"Curiosity rover is located in Gale Crater on Mars.  Lacus Temporis is a feature on the Moon.  Therefore, Curiosity cannot take samples from Lacus Temporis.

"
1768,Can pancreas removal cause bankruptcy?,"Explanation: Pancreas removal is a major surgery often required for conditions like pancreatic cancer.  The procedure itself, along with the necessary pre- and post-operative care (hospital stays, medication, rehabilitation, potential complications requiring further treatment), can generate substantial medical bills.  Depending on insurance coverage and the individual's financial situation, these costs could easily lead to significant debt or even bankruptcy.  The long-term effects of pancreas removal might also require ongoing medical care and lifestyle changes that add to the financial strain.

Answer: {true}
"
1769,Is sunscreen unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley?,"Bob Marley died from acral lentiginous melanoma, a type of skin cancer.  Sunscreen helps protect against the harmful UV rays that cause skin cancer.  Therefore, sunscreen would be helpful in preventing the condition that killed Bob Marley.

"
1770,Would Lord Voldemort have been barred from Hogwarts under his own rules?,"Lord Voldemort, whose real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle, broke several of Hogwarts' rules, most notably, by practicing dark magic and being involved in the death of other students.  Hogwarts' rules, as enforced by Dumbledore and other faculty, explicitly forbid such activities.  Therefore, under his own rules (as enforced by the school and its staff), Lord Voldemort would have faced expulsion, if not worse, for his actions.

Answer: {true}
"
1771,"Would moon cakes be easy to find in Chinatown, Manhattan?","Mooncakes are a traditional food associated with the Mid-Autumn Festival, a significant holiday in many East and Southeast Asian cultures.  Chinatown in Manhattan has a large population of people with these cultural backgrounds and many businesses catering to their traditions and holidays.  Therefore, it's highly likely that mooncakes would be readily available during the appropriate time of year in Chinatown's bakeries and markets.

Answer: {true}
"
1772,Can the President of Mexico vote in New Mexico primaries?,"The President of Mexico is not a citizen of the United States.  To vote in a New Mexico primary, one must be a US citizen and meet other requirements such as residency.  Therefore, the President of Mexico would not be eligible to vote.

Answer: {false}
"
1773,Would an art dealer prize a print of a Van Goh?,"Art dealers would highly value original works by Vincent van Gogh.  However, prints, while potentially valuable depending on their age, rarity, and provenance, are generally less prized than original paintings or drawings.  The value of a print would depend heavily on factors beyond simply being a Van Gogh reproduction.  Therefore, while an art dealer might appreciate a high-quality or rare print, it wouldn't be a prize in the same way an original Van Gogh painting would be.

Answer: {false}
"
1774,Was John George Bice's birthplace near Cornwall?,"John George Bice's birthplace is not explicitly stated in readily available information.  Therefore, determining its proximity to Cornwall is impossible without further information.

Answer: {false}
"
1776,Would Lord Voldemort hypothetically be an effective fighter after Final Fantasy silence is cast?,"Explanation:

The question asks if Lord Voldemort, a fictional character from the Harry Potter universe, would be an effective fighter after the spell ""Silence"" from Final Fantasy is cast upon him.  The Silence spell in Final Fantasy prevents the target from using any spells or abilities.  Lord Voldemort's power is largely derived from his magical abilities, particularly his use of dark magic.  If he's unable to use magic due to the Silence spell, his effectiveness in combat would be significantly reduced. While he might still possess some physical strength, he would lack the overwhelmingly powerful magic attacks that define his fighting style in the Harry Potter universe.  Therefore, he would be far less effective as a fighter.

Answer: {false}
"
1777,Can you buy chlorine at a dollar store?,"Dollar stores typically carry cleaning supplies, and chlorine bleach is a common household cleaning agent.  Therefore, it's likely that at least some dollar stores would carry chlorine bleach. However, the availability of chlorine bleach at a specific dollar store would depend on that store's inventory and location.


Answer: {true}
"
1778,Is hanging a viable execution method on a ship at sea?,"Hanging as an execution method requires a specific setup to ensure a swift and humane death.  This involves a precise drop height relative to the weight of the condemned and the length of the rope, all calculated to break the neck.  On a ship at sea, the pitching and rolling motion of the vessel would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to accurately control these factors.  The unpredictable movement could lead to a failed execution, causing prolonged suffering, or an accidental injury to the executioner.  The lack of a controlled environment and the presence of potentially hazardous sea conditions make hanging at sea a highly impractical and unsafe method of execution.

Answer: {false}

"
1782,Does monster name in West African Folklore that witches send into villages set Scrabble record?,"The question asks if a monster name in West African folklore that witches send into villages set a Scrabble record.  There's no information readily available to link a specific monster name from West African folklore to a Scrabble record.  Scrabble records are typically based on high-scoring words played in official games, and there's no reason to believe any such monster name would be both a valid Scrabble word and hold a record.

Answer: {false}
"
1783,Is Rosemary outclassed as plant found in most song titles?,"To determine if Rosemary is outclassed as a plant found in most song titles, we need to compare the frequency of Rosemary's appearance in song titles to other plants.  There's no readily available database of all song titles and their plant mentions.  Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say whether Rosemary is outclassed. We'd need extensive research across diverse musical genres and eras to make such a determination.  This task is beyond the scope of this system.

"
1784,Is a person with St. Vitus's Dance likely to win a ballet competition?,"St. Vitus's Dance, also known as Sydenham's chorea, is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, jerky movements.  These movements would severely impair a person's ability to perform the precise and controlled movements required in ballet. Therefore, a person with St. Vitus's Dance is highly unlikely to win a ballet competition.

"
1786,Is Hermes equivalent to the Roman god Vulcan?,"Hermes, the Greek messenger god, is equivalent to the Roman god Mercury, not Vulcan.  Vulcan is the Roman god of fire, metalworking, and crafts, corresponding to the Greek god Hephaestus.  Therefore, Hermes and Vulcan are distinct deities with different domains.

Answer: {false}
"
1787,Is an ocelot a good present for a kindergartener?,"An ocelot is a wild cat.  Wild cats are not domesticated animals and require specialized care, a large habitat, and a significant amount of expertise to properly care for.  A kindergartener lacks the maturity, knowledge, and physical capacity to handle such a responsibility.  Furthermore, owning an ocelot is likely illegal or heavily restricted in most jurisdictions without the proper permits and facilities.  Therefore, an ocelot would be a highly inappropriate and dangerous gift for a kindergartener.

Answer: {false}
"
1788,Was Alaska part of the Northern Army during the Civil War?,"The American Civil War (1861-1865) was fought between the Union (Northern) and Confederate (Southern) states.  Alaska was not a part of the United States during the Civil War.  Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, after the war had already ended. Therefore, Alaska could not have been part of the Northern Army.

"
1789,Would New Year's Eve hypothetically be Bacchus's favorite holiday?,"Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, revelry, and fertility, is associated with celebrations and festivals.  New Year's Eve is a major holiday characterized by festive celebrations, often involving alcohol consumption.  Given Bacchus's domain, it's highly likely he would find New Year's Eve to be a particularly enjoyable holiday.

Answer: {true}
"
1790,Is Poseidon similar to the god Vulcan?,"Poseidon and Vulcan are both gods associated with powerful forces of nature, but they have distinct domains and attributes. Poseidon is the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, storms, and horses, while Vulcan is the Roman god of fire, metalworking, and crafts.  They are not similar in their primary functions or symbolic representations.  While both gods hold powerful positions within their respective pantheons, they are fundamentally different deities.

Answer: {false}
"
1791,Did travelers sing sea shanties on the Oregon Trail?,"Sea shanties were primarily sung by sailors at sea, not overland travelers on the Oregon Trail.  While there may have been some singing among the pioneers, sea shanties would not have been the prevalent form of music given their specific association with maritime life.

Answer: {false}
"

"
1793,Do the directors of The Matrix advocate for transgender rights?,"The question asks whether the directors of *The Matrix* advocate for transgender rights.  To answer this, we need to research the publicly available statements and actions of the Wachowskis (Lana and Lilly Wachowski), the directors of *The Matrix*.  Both sisters are transgender women who have been outspoken about their identities and experiences.  Their public advocacy for transgender rights strongly suggests they would be supportive of transgender rights.

"
1794,Would menu at Chinese Starbucks be familiar to an American?,"Explanation:
Starbucks is a global company, and while its core menu items (like lattes, cappuccinos, etc.) are consistent worldwide, there are often regional variations.  A Chinese Starbucks would likely have some beverages and food items that cater to local tastes, using ingredients and flavors common in Chinese cuisine. While an American would recognize many core Starbucks offerings, they might find some items unfamiliar or unique to the Chinese market.


Answer: {false}
"
1795,Does Mario use mushrooms to run faster?,"In the Super Mario games, mushrooms grant Mario additional abilities, primarily an increase in size.  While larger Mario might *appear* to move faster due to his increased height, the actual speed of his movement isn't inherently boosted by the mushroom power-up.  The game mechanics don't link mushroom consumption to a direct speed increase.

Answer: {false}
"
1796,Can children become lieutenants?,"The answer depends on the context.  In a military context, children cannot become lieutenants.  Military service typically requires a minimum age, and the responsibilities of a lieutenant are far beyond the capabilities of a child. In a fictional context or a metaphorical use of the word ""lieutenant,"" it might be possible, but this is not the standard understanding of the word.

Answer: {false}
"
1797,Is the QWERTY keyboard layout meant to be slow?,"The QWERTY keyboard layout's design is often cited as a historical accident, not an intentional slowing-down mechanism.  While some claim it was designed to mitigate the jamming of typewriters by separating frequently used letter combinations, this is debated by many historians.  The original purpose was likely to improve typing speed, but its long-term impact is complex.  Modern typing techniques and keyboard layouts aim for greater efficiency than QWERTY provides. However, the prevalence of QWERTY means it's not inherently designed to be slow, but rather its design is a legacy system that has not been significantly optimized for speed in the decades since its creation.

Answer: {false}
"
1798,Would Nancy Pelosi have hypothetically been on same side as Gerald Ford?,"Nancy Pelosi is a Democrat, and Gerald Ford was a Republican.  While there might have been instances of agreement on specific issues, their overall political ideologies and party affiliations would generally place them on opposing sides of most major political debates.

Answer: {false}
"
1799,Do Sweet Potatoes prevent other plants from growing in their place?,"Sweet potatoes, like other plants, can release allelochemicals into the soil.  These are chemicals that can inhibit the growth of other plants nearby.  The effect varies depending on the variety of sweet potato and the specific soil conditions. While it's not guaranteed that sweet potatoes will completely prevent other plants from growing, they can certainly hinder the growth of some plants in their vicinity through allelopathy.

Answer: {true}
"
1800,Would a hedgehog avoid animals without a spinal cord?,"Hedgehogs are insectivores with a diet consisting primarily of insects, worms, and other invertebrates.  Animals without spinal cords, such as jellyfish or certain worms, may or may not be part of a hedgehog's diet depending on the species of hedgehog and the availability of the invertebrate.  Some invertebrates lacking spines are definitely on the menu for hedgehogs, whereas other spinal-cord-less animals are not.  The question is therefore too vague to answer definitively.

Answer: {false}
"
1801,Can paresthesia be caused by a white pigment?,"Paresthesia is a sensation of tingling, prickling, or numbness.  While certain pigments might be associated with products that *could* cause paresthesia through contact dermatitis or other allergic reactions,  a white pigment itself does not directly cause paresthesia.  The paresthesia would be a result of an *interaction* with the body, not a direct effect of the pigment's chemical properties.  For example, a white pigment in a paint might contain a chemical that causes an allergic reaction leading to paresthesia, but the whiteness is irrelevant to the causal mechanism.

Answer: {false}
"
1802,"Are Scottish people descended from Mary, Queen of Scots part French?","Mary, Queen of Scots was of royal descent from both the Stuart kings of Scotland and the French Valois dynasty.  Her mother, Mary of Guise, was French.  Therefore, anyone descended from Mary, Queen of Scots would have some degree of French ancestry through her maternal line.

Answer: {true}
"
1803,Did any citizen of San Antonio vote for Boris Johnson?,"The question asks if any citizen of San Antonio voted for Boris Johnson.  San Antonio is a city in Texas, USA. Boris Johnson was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Citizens of San Antonio would not have been eligible to vote in a UK election.  Therefore, no citizen of San Antonio could have voted for Boris Johnson.

Answer: {false}
"
1804,Does handedness determine how you use American Sign Language?,"American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language that uses handshapes, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning.  While dominant hand preference (right-handed or left-handed) might influence which hand a signer uses more frequently for certain signs, it doesn't determine *how* ASL is used.  The grammatical structure and vocabulary of ASL are independent of handedness.  Signers adapt their signing based on their individual preferences and what feels most comfortable and efficient, but they still follow the same grammatical rules and vocabulary regardless of their dominant hand.  There are no different versions of ASL for right-handed and left-handed individuals.

Answer: {false}
"
1805,Did the confederate states speak Old English before the Civil War?,"The Confederate States of America existed from 1861 to 1865.  Old English was spoken in England centuries before this, roughly from the mid-5th century to the 15th century.  The language spoken in the Confederate states during the Civil War was English, a descendant of Old English but significantly evolved.  There's no basis to suggest they spoke Old English.

Answer: {true}
"
1808,Does Capricorn astrology symbol have all of the parts of a chimera?,"The Capricorn astrological symbol is a sea-goat, a creature with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish.  A chimera, on the other hand, is a mythical creature composed of parts from multiple animals. While the sea-goat has parts from two animals (goat and fish), a chimera typically has parts from three or more.  Therefore, the Capricorn symbol does not have *all* the parts of a chimera.

Answer: {false}
"
1809,Was the Japanese street aesthetic once illuminated by noble gasses?,"Neon lights, a prominent feature of Japanese street aesthetics, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, utilize noble gases like neon, argon, krypton, and xenon to produce their characteristic glow.  Therefore, noble gases have indeed illuminated Japanese street aesthetics.

Answer: {true}
"
1810,Can shooting bald eagle get a person more prison time than Michael Vick?,"Explanation:

Michael Vick's prison sentence was 23 months for his involvement in a dogfighting ring.  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act makes it illegal to harm bald eagles, with penalties that can include significant fines and up to one year in prison for a first offense.  However,  the penalties can be far more severe depending on the number of eagles harmed and other circumstances.  While a single instance of shooting a bald eagle might not result in more than a year of prison, depending on the specifics, multiple violations or other aggravating factors could easily lead to a longer sentence than Vick received.  Therefore, it's possible, depending on the circumstances, that shooting a bald eagle could result in a longer prison sentence than Michael Vick received.

Answer: {true}
"
1811,Does the United States of America touch the Indian Ocean?,"The United States of America is located in North America and does not border the Indian Ocean.  The Indian Ocean is located between Africa, Asia, and Australia.  The closest point of the U.S. to the Indian Ocean would be the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent which is a considerable distance away.

Answer: {false}
"
1812,Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?,"Sophists were ancient Greek teachers of rhetoric and philosophy who emphasized persuasive argumentation, regardless of the truth or morality of their arguments.  Lawyers, especially in adversarial systems, need to be skilled in persuasion and presenting arguments effectively, even if those arguments are defending a client who is demonstrably guilty.  The Sophists' focus on rhetoric and argumentation, therefore, would make them well-suited to the skills required of a lawyer.  Their lack of concern for truth, however, could be considered a negative trait for a lawyer, depending on their ethical standards.  Overall, their skills in rhetoric and argumentation would likely make them effective lawyers.

Answer: {true}
"
1813,4 Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts exceed AHA  daily sugar allowance?,"The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends a maximum of 25 grams of added sugar per day for women and 36 grams per day for men.  A Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut contains approximately 10 grams of added sugar.  Therefore, four Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts would contain 40 grams of added sugar, exceeding the AHA's daily recommendation for both men and women.

1815,Are people banned from entering the Forbidden City?,"The Forbidden City, located in Beijing, China, was the imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty.  While it's no longer a functioning imperial palace, it is now a museum and a major tourist attraction.  However, there are rules and regulations about visiting.  While people are not banned outright from entering, access is controlled.  There are rules regarding hours of operation, ticket purchases, and potentially restrictions on certain areas depending on events or maintenance.  Therefore, while entry isn't completely forbidden, it's not freely accessible at all times or to everyone.

Answer: {false}
"
1816,"If you have a serious injury in Bangladesh, would you probably dial a Fibonacci number?","Emergency numbers are not Fibonacci numbers.

1820,Do tourists prefer Tuvalu to Niue?,"There is no readily available data to directly compare tourist preferences between Tuvalu and Niue.  Both are small island nations in the Pacific with limited tourism infrastructure and appeal to niche travelers.  Factors like accessibility, available activities, and marketing efforts would influence tourist choices, but there is no publicly available data to definitively state which one is preferred.

Answer: {Cannot be determined}
"
1821,"Is ""A Tale of Two Cities"" a parody of the Bible?","""A Tale of Two Cities"" by Charles Dickens draws parallels with biblical themes and stories, particularly through its depiction of sacrifice, resurrection, and redemption.  However, it doesn't satirize or mock the Bible in a way that constitutes a parody.  Instead, it uses biblical allusions and structures to enhance its narrative and thematic depth. While there are thematic similarities, the novel's purpose isn't to comedically reinterpret or undermine the Bible.  The novel uses the language and structure of epic storytelling with themes consistent with the Bible, but it doesn't make fun of or directly lampoon the Bible itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1822,Can binary numbers and standard alphabet satisfy criteria for a strong password?,"A strong password generally needs to meet several criteria to be resistant to cracking.  These often include:

* **Length:**  A longer password is inherently more difficult to guess or crack through brute-force methods.
* **Complexity:** A strong password should include a mix of character types: uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Uniqueness:**  The password should not be easily guessable, using common words or patterns.

Binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) alone don't fully satisfy these criteria for a strong password. While combining them increases length and incorporates two character types (numbers and letters), they lack the necessary complexity (no symbols) and may still be vulnerable if a simple pattern is used (e.g., alternating binary digits with letters).  A truly strong password needs all three character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) for optimal security.

Answer: {false}

1823,Did Andy Warhol influence Art Deco style?,"Andy Warhol was a leading figure of the Pop Art movement, which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s.  Art Deco, on the other hand, flourished in the 1920s and 1930s.  While both styles involved visual art, they are distinct and separated by several decades.  Warhol's work is characterized by its mass-produced imagery, bold colors, and critique of consumerism, whereas Art Deco is known for its geometric shapes, streamlined forms, and luxurious materials.  There's no evidence to suggest that Warhol's work was directly influenced by or significantly influenced Art Deco.

1825,Has spinach been a source of power in a comic movie?,"Popeye the Sailor Man is a famous cartoon character whose strength is derived from eating spinach.  While Popeye is not strictly a character from a ""comic movie"" in the modern sense (though he has appeared in films), he is a character from comic strips and cartoons that have been adapted into various media, including films.  His association with spinach as a source of power is widely known and iconic.

1826,Does welding with acetylene simulate the temperature of a star?,"Acetylene torches produce temperatures around 3,000°C (5,432°F).  While this is extremely hot, it is far below the temperature of even the coolest stars.  The surface temperature of the Sun, for instance, is around 5,500°C (9,932°F).  Other stars have surface temperatures ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of degrees Celsius.  Therefore, the temperature of an acetylene torch is significantly lower than the temperature of a star.

Answer: {false}

1827,Can an adult male stand on top Donatello's bronze David and touch the Sistine Chapel ceiling?,"Donatello's bronze David is a relatively small sculpture.  The Sistine Chapel ceiling is very high. Even if an adult male could somehow stand on top of Donatello's David (which is improbable given the sculpture's size and stability), he would still be nowhere near tall enough to reach the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  The height difference is insurmountable.

Answer: {false}
"
1828,Is it dangerous to consume chlorine when mixed with sodium?,"Explanation:
Mixing chlorine (Cl₂) with sodium (Na) is extremely dangerous.  Sodium is a highly reactive alkali metal, and chlorine is a highly reactive halogen gas. When they come into contact, they react violently to form sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly known as table salt. This reaction is highly exothermic, meaning it releases a significant amount of heat. The reaction can be explosive, producing intense heat and light.  Therefore, consuming this mixture would be incredibly dangerous and potentially lethal.

Answer: {true}
"
1829,Could Moulin Rouge have been hypothetically used as Spain's Spanish American War triage center?,"Moulin Rouge is a famous cabaret in Paris, France. The Spanish-American War was fought between Spain and the United States in Cuba and the Philippines.  The geographical distance between Paris and the war zones makes it completely infeasible for Moulin Rouge to have served as a triage center.  Furthermore, Moulin Rouge is a cabaret, not a medical facility.  It lacks the necessary infrastructure, personnel, and equipment for medical treatment.

Answer: {false}
"
1830,Would Downton Abbey finale viewership defeat every Kazakhstan citizen in tug of war?,"To determine if Downton Abbey's finale viewership could defeat every citizen of Kazakhstan in a tug-of-war, we need to consider the following:

1. **Downton Abbey Finale Viewership:** We need an estimate of the number of viewers.  This number would vary depending on the definition of ""viewership"" (e.g., live viewership vs. total viewers across all platforms).  Let's assume a very high estimate, for the sake of argument.

2. **Kazakhstan Population:**  We need the population of Kazakhstan.  This is a readily available statistic.

3. **Tug-of-War Dynamics:**  A tug-of-war isn't simply about numbers.  Strength, technique, and coordination also play a significant role.  It's highly unlikely that a disparate, unorganized group of Downton Abbey viewers (even a large number of them) could effectively coordinate against an entire nation.

4. **Unrealistic Scenario:**  The scenario presented is inherently unrealistic.  Organizing and coordinating such a contest would be practically impossible.


Therefore, even with a large estimated viewership for the Downton Abbey finale, it is extremely improbable that they could win a tug-of-war against the entire population of Kazakhstan.  The sheer number of people in Kazakhstan, coupled with the impracticality of the situation, makes this highly unlikely.


Answer: {false}
"
1831,Are some Do It Yourself projects potentially lethal?,"Explanation: Many DIY projects involve the use of tools, chemicals, and electricity, all of which can be dangerous if not handled properly.  Improper use of power tools can lead to serious injury or even death.  Working with chemicals can result in exposure to hazardous substances, causing burns, respiratory problems, or other health issues.  Electrical work, if done incorrectly, poses a significant risk of electrocution.  Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that some DIY projects have the potential to be lethal.

Answer: {true}
"
1832,Is an Eastern chipmunk likely to die before seeing two leap years?,"Explanation:

The average lifespan of an Eastern chipmunk is 2-3 years.  A leap year occurs every four years.  Therefore, a chipmunk would likely live less than the eight years it would take to see two leap years.  While some chipmunks might live longer than the average, it is unlikely one would survive long enough.

Answer: {true}
"
1833,Does Super Mario require electricity to play?,"Super Mario games, depending on the platform, can be played on various consoles and devices.  Modern consoles like the Switch require electricity to function. Older consoles like the NES and SNES also required electricity.  Even handheld versions like the Game Boy required batteries, which are a form of stored electricity.  Therefore, playing any version of Super Mario requires some form of electrical power.

Answer: {true}
"
1834,Can Chinese mountain cat survive in the orbit?,"Explanation:
The Chinese mountain cat is a terrestrial mammal.  Survival in orbit requires the ability to withstand the extreme conditions of space, including:

* **Vacuum of space:** Lack of air pressure would cause the cat's lungs to collapse and blood to boil.
* **Extreme temperatures:**  Orbit experiences extreme temperature variations, far exceeding the range a cat can tolerate.
* **Radiation:**  Exposure to high levels of radiation would cause severe damage to the cat's cells and DNA.
* **Lack of oxygen:**  The cat would suffocate.
* **Microgravity:**  The lack of gravity would severely impact the cat's bodily functions and ability to move.


Given these conditions, a Chinese mountain cat would not survive in orbit.

Answer: {false}
"
1835,Will a rock float in the atmosphere of Earth?,"Rocks are denser than air.  The buoyant force exerted by the air on a rock is negligible compared to the rock's weight. Therefore, a rock will not float in Earth's atmosphere.

1837,Was a USB flash drive used in The Godfather?,"The Godfather is a movie released in 1972. USB flash drives were not invented until the late 1990s.  Therefore, a USB flash drive could not have been used in The Godfather.

Answer: {false}
"
1838,Were some people afraid of New Years Day coming in 1999?,"Y2K, or the year 2000 problem, was a widespread concern that computer systems would malfunction at the turn of the millennium because many systems stored dates using only two digits for the year (e.g., 99 for 1999).  The fear was that when the year rolled over to 00, computers would interpret this as 1900, leading to widespread system failures affecting everything from banking to power grids.  While this fear was not specifically tied to January 1st, 1999, the anticipation and preparation for the Y2K bug built up throughout 1999, leading to anxiety and fear amongst many about the potential for widespread chaos in the year 2000.  Therefore, while not directly about New Year's Day 1999 itself, there was related fear about the impending Y2K problem.

Answer: {true}
"
1839,Would Woodrow Wilson support Plessy v. Ferguson decision?,"Woodrow Wilson, while President of the United States, oversaw a period of increased racial segregation within the federal government.  He implemented policies that separated Black and white employees, a move that directly mirrored the ""separate but equal"" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson.  Given his actions and the context of the time, it's highly probable that he would have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision.

"
1841,Can you hide a pet macaque under your desk?,"A pet macaque is a monkey, and monkeys are relatively large animals.  Even a small macaque would be too large to comfortably fit under a standard desk.  They also require a lot of space, enrichment and specialized care, making them unsuitable as a ""hidden"" pet.

Answer: {false}
"
1842,Are there Pink music videos that are triggering for eating disorder patients?,"Pink's music often tackles themes of empowerment and self-acceptance, but some of her music videos may contain imagery or themes that could be triggering for individuals with eating disorders.  For example, videos that focus on extreme thinness or body modification, or that portray unrealistic body standards, could be upsetting or harmful to someone recovering from or struggling with an eating disorder. While not all of Pink's videos would necessarily be triggering, the possibility exists depending on the individual's sensitivity and the specific content of the video.  Therefore, a definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" is difficult to provide without specifying which music videos are in question.


Answer: {true}
"
1843,Can brewing occur in a prison environment?,"Answer: Prison environments often have strict rules and regulations regarding the possession and use of materials.  While some prisons might allow for limited brewing activities as part of a rehabilitative program (e.g., making kombucha or similar non-alcoholic beverages), the production of alcohol is highly illegal and unsafe within a prison setting due to potential health risks, security concerns, and the potential for instigating violence.  Therefore, the typical brewing process associated with beer or wine production would be highly unlikely and almost certainly prohibited.

Answer: {false}
"
1844,Can someone from New England profit by growing coffee?,"New England's climate is not suitable for growing coffee.  Coffee plants require a tropical or subtropical climate with consistent warmth, high humidity, and ample rainfall.  The short, cool growing season and occasional frost in New England would prevent coffee plants from thriving. Therefore, it would be highly unlikely for someone in New England to profitably grow coffee.

Answer: {false}
"
1845,Is a krabby patty similar to a cheeseburger?,"A Krabby Patty, from the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants, is depicted as a hamburger-like patty served in a bun.  While the exact ingredients are never explicitly stated, it is visually represented as containing cheese and other toppings, much like a cheeseburger. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that a Krabby Patty is similar to a cheeseburger.

Answer: {true}
"
1846,Would it be impossible to seat every Chief Justice of the United States on a Boeing 737?,"A Boeing 737 has a variable passenger capacity depending on the configuration, but generally seats between 130 and 215 passengers.  There have been 17 Chief Justices of the United States.  Since 17 is far less than the minimum seating capacity of a 737, it would be possible to seat all 17 Chief Justices on a Boeing 737.

Answer: {false}
"
1847,Would a crocodile survive longer in Great Salt Lake than alligator?,"Alligators and crocodiles have different salinity tolerances.  Alligators are freshwater animals and cannot tolerate high salinity.  Great Salt Lake is a hypersaline lake, meaning it has a very high salt concentration.  Crocodiles, while primarily freshwater animals, have a greater tolerance for brackish water (water with some salt content). While neither would thrive, a crocodile would likely survive longer in the Great Salt Lake than an alligator due to its higher salinity tolerance.


Answer: {true}
"
1848,Was Saudi Aramco started due to an assassination?,"The assassination of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia in 1975 did not directly cause the creation of Saudi Aramco.  Saudi Aramco's origins trace back much earlier, to the 1930s, with the discovery of oil and the subsequent development of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia by Standard Oil of California (SOCAL) and other companies.  While the assassination was a significant event in Saudi Arabian history, it didn't trigger the formation of the company.

Answer: {false}
"
1849,Could a Diwali celebration feature a crustacean?,"Diwali is a Hindu festival of lights.  While there aren't specific traditional dishes *requiring* crustaceans, many regional variations of Diwali feasts include seafood.  Therefore, it's certainly possible, and even plausible, for a Diwali celebration to feature a crustacean dish.

Answer: {true}
"
1850,Did goddess Friday is named after despise felines?,"The question is based on a false premise. There is no known goddess named Friday.  The name ""Friday"" is derived from the Norse goddess Frigg, not from any association with a dislike of felines.  Therefore, the statement is false.

Answer: {false}
"
1851,Can soup be eaten with the hands?,"Some soups, particularly those with thicker consistencies or served with bread for dipping, can be eaten with the hands, although this is not the standard or expected way to eat soup in most cultures.  Using a spoon is the overwhelmingly common and socially acceptable method. Therefore, while technically possible in some specific circumstances, it's generally not considered appropriate.

1853,Would Eric Clapton's mother hypothetically be unable to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth?,"Eric Clapton was born in 1945.  The legal smoking age in the United States has varied over time, but it was significantly lower than 21 in 1945.  Therefore, even if his mother was a minor, it's highly unlikely that purchasing cigarettes would have been illegal for her at that time.

1855,Would Iggy Pop travel with Justin Bieber?,"Iggy Pop and Justin Bieber are both musicians, but they represent very different genres and styles.  Their personalities and target audiences are also quite distinct.  While it's not impossible they might cross paths at an event or industry function, it's highly unlikely they would choose to travel together.  There's no evidence or reason to suggest they are close friends or have a collaborative relationship that would lead to joint travel.

Answer: {false}
"
1856,Would Eminem perform well at the International Mathematical Olympiad?,"Eminem is a highly successful rapper and songwriter, known for his lyrical skills and musical talent.  However, his expertise lies in music and creative writing, not in mathematics. The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) requires advanced mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities.  There's no evidence to suggest Eminem possesses the mathematical proficiency necessary to perform well at this highly competitive international competition.

1857,Could Godzilla have been killed by the Tohoku earthquake?,"The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 were devastating events.  However, Godzilla is a fictional giant monster.  Real-world events like earthquakes cannot affect fictional creatures.

Answer: {false}
"
1858,Could you watch all of JAG in six months?,"To determine if it's possible to watch all of JAG in six months, we need to estimate the total runtime of the series.  JAG ran for 10 seasons, with approximately 22 episodes per season. This totals roughly 220 episodes.

Assuming an average episode length of 45 minutes, the total runtime is approximately 220 episodes * 45 minutes/episode = 9900 minutes.  Converting this to hours, we get 9900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 165 hours.

Six months has approximately 180 days.  If we assume an average viewing time of 1 hour per day, that's 180 hours of viewing time. This is less than the total runtime of JAG.

However, it's reasonable to watch more than 1 hour of television per day.  If someone were to watch for 2 hours per day, they could finish the series in about 82.5 days.  If they watch for 3 hours per day, it would take approximately 55 days. 


Therefore, depending on the daily watch time, it is possible to watch all of JAG within six months.

Answer: {true}
"
1859,Is the Greek alphabet as common as Sumerian cuneiform?,"The Greek alphabet is still in use today and forms the basis of many modern alphabets.  Sumerian cuneiform, on the other hand, is an ancient writing system that is no longer in use.  While cuneiform is historically significant, its usage is far less common than the Greek alphabet.  Therefore, the Greek alphabet is far more common than Sumerian cuneiform.

Answer: {false}
"
1860,Does selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pay for a year at Columbia University?,"To determine if selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pays for a year at Columbia University, we need to compare the resale value of a 2020 Corvette to the cost of tuition and fees at Columbia University for one year.

Let's assume the average resale value of a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette in good condition is around $60,000.  This is a rough estimate and can vary greatly depending on the trim level, mileage, and condition of the vehicle.

Columbia University's tuition and fees are significantly higher than $60,000.  For the 2023-2024 academic year, tuition alone was over $60,000.  Adding in fees, room, and board, the total cost of attending for a year is well over $80,000.

Therefore, the resale value of a 2020 Corvette is considerably less than the cost of attending Columbia University for one year.  It would not even come close to covering the expenses.

Answer: {false}
"
1861,Could all Tahiti hotels hypothetically accommodate US D-Day troops?,"To determine if all Tahiti hotels could hypothetically accommodate US D-Day troops, we need to consider the number of troops involved in D-Day and the total capacity of hotels in Tahiti.

The D-Day invasion involved approximately 156,000 troops.  Finding the exact capacity of all hotels in Tahiti would require extensive research, but it's highly unlikely that the total number of rooms in all Tahitian hotels even comes close to 156,000.  Tahiti is a relatively small island nation with a limited tourism infrastructure compared to a major global city. Even if we accounted for multiple people sharing rooms, the capacity would still be far lower.

Therefore, it's highly improbable that all Tahitian hotels could accommodate the US D-Day troops.

Answer: {false}

"
1863,Are more watermelons grown in Brazil than Antarctica?,"Watermelons require warm temperatures and fertile soil to grow.  Brazil has a tropical and subtropical climate with suitable conditions for watermelon cultivation. Antarctica, on the other hand, is a continent covered in ice and snow with extremely harsh conditions unsuitable for any significant agriculture, including watermelons. Therefore, a vastly larger number of watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica.

1864,Is Edward Snowden in hiding from the United States?,"Edward Snowden is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA).  He leaked classified information from the NSA in 2013, revealing mass surveillance programs.  After leaking the information, he fled the United States and sought asylum in Russia. The US government has indicted him on espionage charges, and he remains in Russia, effectively in hiding from the US authorities to avoid prosecution.

Answer: {true}
"
1865,Do Leafhoppers compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources?,"Leafhoppers are insects that feed on plant sap.  Log Cabin syrup is made from maple sap. While both leafhoppers and maple syrup producers utilize maple trees, they do so in fundamentally different ways. Leafhoppers consume sap directly, potentially harming the tree's health and reducing sap production. Log Cabin syrup producers harvest sap, a process that, while impacting the tree's resources, is managed to sustain the trees' health for future harvests.  Therefore, their competition is indirect and not direct competition for the same resources. They both rely on the trees, but their needs differ significantly.

Answer: {false}
"
1866,Is euphoria associated with drug addiction?,"Euphoria is a feeling of intense pleasure and happiness.  Many addictive drugs trigger the release of dopamine in the brain, creating feelings of euphoria. This feeling of euphoria is a key factor in the development and maintenance of drug addiction.  Users often seek out the drug to recreate this pleasurable state, leading to dependence and compulsive drug-seeking behavior. Therefore, euphoria is strongly associated with drug addiction.

Answer: {true}
"
1867,Was Anthony Quinn more prolific at making children than J.D. Salinger?,"Anthony Quinn had 13 children across three marriages. J.D. Salinger had one child with his first wife.  Therefore, Anthony Quinn had significantly more children than J.D. Salinger.

Answer: {true}
"
1868,Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?,"Edgar Allan Poe's works were not widely read or appreciated during his lifetime, meaning his earnings from writing were minimal.  While he may have received some income from magazine publications and a small book advance here and there, he certainly wasn't wealthy from his literary efforts. His death was attributed in part to poverty and financial hardship. Therefore, proofreading his works would not have been a lucrative endeavor for anyone, as there would likely have been minimal demand for such a service and the compensation would reflect that limited demand.

Answer: {false}
"
1869,Is capturing giant squid in natural habitat impossible with no gear?,"Giant squid are elusive deep-sea creatures, inhabiting vast and inaccessible ocean depths.  Without specialized equipment like submersibles, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), or sophisticated traps, capturing a giant squid in its natural habitat would be practically impossible.  Even with advanced technology, capturing them is exceptionally difficult.  Therefore, attempting this feat without any gear whatsoever is highly improbable.

Answer: {true}
"
1870,Would the author of Little Women have remembered the ratification of the 13th Amendment?,"Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Women, was born in 1832 and died in 1888.  The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, abolishing slavery, was ratified in December 1865.  Since Alcott lived well into the period after the 13th Amendment's ratification, it's highly probable she would have remembered it.

Answer: {true}
"
1872,Does Dragon Ball shows and movies fall short of Friday 13th number of projects?,"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of Dragon Ball projects (shows and movies) to the number of Friday the 13th projects.  Finding exact numbers for both franchises can be difficult due to variations in what constitutes a ""project"" (e.g., including spin-offs, video games, etc.), but we can make a reasonable comparison.

The Friday the 13th franchise is well-known for its numerous films, spanning many sequels and related media. It has at least 12 main films, plus numerous other projects such as video games and books.

The Dragon Ball franchise also has a large number of projects, including multiple anime series (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super), movies, video games, and other related media.  While the exact count is debatable, it's safe to say there are many more Dragon Ball projects than just 12.

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the number of Dragon Ball projects is less than the number of Friday the 13th projects.

1876,Should you bring your own bags to Aldi?,"Aldi is a grocery store known for its low prices and efficient operations.  A key part of their efficiency is minimizing overhead, including the cost of providing bags to customers.  To encourage customers to bring their own bags and reduce their environmental impact, Aldi does not typically provide free bags at checkout. While they may sell bags at the checkout, bringing your own reusable bags is the standard and expected practice.

Answer: {true}
"
1877,Could a Porsche 992 Turbo S defeat Usain Bolt in a 100 meter sprint?,"The Porsche 992 Turbo S has a 0-60 mph time of around 2.5 seconds.  However, this is a measure of acceleration, not top speed maintained over 100 meters.  While the car would accelerate incredibly quickly off the line, Usain Bolt's top speed and the ability to maintain that speed over the full 100 meters make him the clear winner. The car's acceleration advantage would likely only be significant in the very first few meters of the race.  Bolt's sustained speed would overcome the car's initial lead.

Answer: {false}
"
1878,Are the brooms from curling good for using on house floors?,"Curling brooms, while designed for sweeping ice, are not suitable for cleaning house floors.  Their bristles are stiff and designed to propel small ice chips, not dust or dirt. Using them on a house floor would likely scratch or damage the flooring.  Furthermore, the construction of curling brooms is not intended for the kinds of messes found in a house and would be ineffective.

Answer: {false}
"
1879,Does having lip piercings lead to more expensive dental bills?,"Answer: Lip piercings can increase the risk of damage to teeth and gums.  This increased risk stems from the potential for the jewelry to chip or crack teeth, or to cause gum irritation and infection leading to gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis).  Treating these dental problems, whether through fillings, crowns, extractions, or periodontal treatments, can be expensive. Therefore, having lip piercings could lead to more expensive dental bills.

Answer: {true}

1880,Is ABBA's 1970's genre still relevant today?,"Answer: ABBA's music from the 1970s, characterized by its pop sound with elements of disco and even some early synth-pop, continues to be enjoyed and relevant today.  Their songs are frequently played on classic rock radio stations, are sampled by contemporary artists, and their music remains popular in various media, including film and television.  While their style might be considered retro, the quality of songwriting and the catchy nature of their tunes ensures continued appeal across generations.  The enduring popularity of ABBA is evidenced by their recent ""ABBA Voyage"" concert experience using digital avatars, demonstrating a sustained relevance and interest in their music.

Answer: {true}
"
1881,Is J.D. Salinger's most successful work influential to killers?,"J.D. Salinger's *The Catcher in the Rye* has been cited in connection with several acts of violence and killings, although there's no direct causal link.  The book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield, expresses alienation, rebellion, and a profound sense of disillusionment.  Some individuals who have committed violent acts have cited the book as an influence, but it's crucial to note that this is often interpreted selectively and doesn't reflect the full complexity of the novel or the motivations of the individuals involved.  The book’s influence is therefore a complex and controversial topic, often oversimplified in discussions. While some killers have referenced the book, it's not inherently influential to killers in a definitive way.  Many readers relate to Holden's struggles without resorting to violence.

Answer: {false}
"
1882,Would Cyndi Lauper use milk substitute in her rice pudding?,"Cyndi Lauper is a vegan.  Vegans do not consume dairy products.  Rice pudding traditionally contains milk. Therefore, a vegan like Cyndi Lauper would likely use a milk substitute in her rice pudding.

"
1886,Are you more likely to find bipolar disorder in a crowd than diabetes?,"Explanation:

Bipolar disorder and diabetes are both relatively common conditions, but they affect different populations and have different prevalence rates.  Diabetes has a significantly higher prevalence rate than bipolar disorder. While precise numbers vary by region and demographic factors, diabetes affects a much larger percentage of the population globally than bipolar disorder.  Therefore, you are far more likely to encounter someone with diabetes in a random crowd than someone with bipolar disorder.

1888,Could an NBA game be completed within the span of the Six-Day War?,"The Six-Day War lasted from June 5th to June 10th, 1967 – a total of six days.  An NBA game, including warm-ups, halftime, and potential overtime, typically takes around 2.5 to 3 hours.  This is significantly less than the 144 hours (6 days) available during the war. Therefore, an NBA game could easily be completed within the time frame of the Six-Day War.

"
1891,Can the theory of cultural hegemony explain global warming?,"Cultural hegemony, a concept developed by Antonio Gramsci, describes how the dominant culture maintains its power not just through force, but also through ideological influence.  This influence shapes beliefs, values, and behaviors, making the existing power structure seem natural and inevitable.  While cultural hegemony can explain how certain dominant narratives and behaviors affect environmental issues, it doesn't directly *explain* global warming itself.  Global warming is a scientific phenomenon driven by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activity.  Cultural hegemony might explain *why* there's resistance to addressing climate change (e.g., denialism fueled by vested interests promoting fossil fuels, consumerism discouraging lifestyle changes, or political ideologies downplaying scientific consensus). It might also explain the uneven impact of climate change, as marginalized communities often bear the brunt of its consequences due to existing power imbalances. However, it cannot explain the underlying physical and chemical processes that cause the temperature increase.  Therefore, while cultural hegemony is relevant to understanding the societal response to and exacerbation of global warming, it is not an explanation for the phenomenon itself.

Answer: {false}
"
1895,Do Armenians tend to dislike System of a Down?,"There is no evidence to suggest that Armenians generally dislike System of a Down.  In fact, System of a Down is a very popular band with a significant Armenian-American following, given the band members' Armenian heritage and the band's frequent incorporation of Armenian themes and language in their music.  While individual opinions will vary, it's inaccurate to generalize and claim Armenians tend to dislike the band.

Answer: {false}
"
1896,Can the Powerpuff Girls form a complete tag team wrestling match?,"The Powerpuff Girls consist of three members: Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.  A standard tag team wrestling match requires two teams of two wrestlers each.  Since there are only three Powerpuff Girls, they cannot form two teams of two. Therefore, they cannot form a complete tag team wrestling match.

Answer: {false}
"
1897,Can you listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year?,"To determine if one can listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year, we need to estimate the total length of the catalog and compare it to the total number of hours in a year.  There's no publicly available exact number for the total length of all songs on iTunes.  However, we can make a reasonable estimation.

Let's assume, very conservatively, there are 50 million songs on iTunes (this is likely an underestimate).  The average song length is approximately 3 minutes (180 seconds).

Total seconds of music: 50,000,000 songs * 180 seconds/song = 9,000,000,000 seconds

Total hours of music: 9,000,000,000 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 2,500,000 hours

Total hours in a year: 365 days/year * 24 hours/day = 8760 hours

Comparison: 2,500,000 hours (music) >> 8760 hours (year)

Therefore, it's impossible to listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year.

1900,Would WWF be angrier if you killed koala instead of black swan?,"The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is concerned with the conservation of all species.  However, koalas are currently classified as endangered, while black swans are not.  Endangered species are given higher priority for conservation efforts.  Therefore, killing a koala would likely provoke a stronger reaction from the WWF than killing a black swan.

1903,Does Ahura Mazda have a rivalry with Zeus?,"Ahura Mazda is the supreme god in Zoroastrianism, a Persian religion. Zeus is the supreme god in Greek mythology.  These are distinct and separate pantheons from different cultures and time periods. While there might be thematic similarities in their roles as supreme deities, there's no inherent rivalry or interaction between them within their respective mythologies.  The two are unrelated figures.

"
1905,Did University of Pittsburgh founder have great deal in common with Judith Sheindlin?,"The University of Pittsburgh was founded in 1787.  Judith Sheindlin, also known as Judge Judy, was born in 1942.  Therefore, they could not have had a great deal in common in terms of direct interaction or shared contemporary experiences.  While both are associated with the legal system (the university having a law school and Judge Judy being a judge), this is a very tenuous connection and doesn't represent a ""great deal"" in common.

Answer: {false}
"
1906,Can a Toyota Supra make a vlog?,"A Toyota Supra is a car.  Cars cannot make vlogs. Vlogs require a person to operate a camera, film footage, and edit the footage.  A car lacks the sentience and dexterity to perform these actions.

1907,Would most grand masters know what the French Defense is?,"The French Defense is a common and well-known opening in chess.  Grandmasters, by definition, are the elite players at the highest level of chess competition.  They would have extensive knowledge of chess openings, strategies, and tactics, and the French Defense is a significant opening that's frequently encountered.  Therefore, it's highly probable that almost all grandmasters would be familiar with the French Defense.

"
1908,Does Canada have a relationship with a monarch?,"Canada is a constitutional monarchy.  This means that the Canadian head of state is the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, currently King Charles III.  While the monarch's role is largely ceremonial,  the Canadian Constitution establishes the monarch as the ultimate source of governmental authority.  The monarch's power is exercised through the Governor General, who represents the monarch in Canada.

"
1909,Would a Pict be confused by Old English?,"Pictish and Old English are distinct languages with different origins and linguistic families.  Pictish is a poorly understood language from ancient Scotland, belonging to an unknown language family. Old English, on the other hand, is an early form of English belonging to the Germanic language family. Given the significant linguistic differences and the geographic distance separating Pictish speakers (in Scotland) from Old English speakers (primarily in England), it's highly likely a Pict would be utterly confused by Old English.

1911,Would Garfield like canid food?,"Garfield is a cat. Cats are felines and are carnivores.  Canid food is food for canines, which are dogs.  Dogs and cats have different dietary needs.  Garfield, being a cat, would likely not like, and probably wouldn't eat, dog food.

Answer: {false}
"
1912,Would Franz Ferdinand have survived with armadillo armor?,"Answer: Armadillo armor, while providing significant protection, is unlikely to have been sufficient to protect Franz Ferdinand from the assassination attempt.  The assassin used a pistol, and while the armor might have deflected a glancing blow or slowed a bullet, it is improbable that it would have stopped a bullet fired at close range.  The armor would likely not have protected against the second shot fired. Therefore, it's unlikely that armadillo armor would have saved Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Answer: {false}
"
1913,Do restaurants associate meatballs with the wrong country of origin?,"Meatballs are a dish found in numerous cuisines around the world, each with its own unique variations in ingredients and preparation.  While often associated with Italian cuisine, and Italian-American restaurants in particular, meatballs are not of solely Italian origin.  Many cultures have similar dishes featuring ground meat rolled into balls and cooked.  Therefore, the association of meatballs solely with Italy is a simplification and potentially an inaccuracy depending on context.  Some restaurants might explicitly state their meatballs are Italian style, which would be accurate, while others may simply use the term ""meatballs"" without specifying origin, in which case associating them with the wrong country is a matter of interpretation and potentially inaccurate depending on the recipe and preparation.


Answer: {true}
"
1914,Will the torso be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in body?,"The question asks if the torso would be safe from blows targeting the largest and smallest bones in the body.  The largest bone is the femur (thigh bone), and the smallest are the stapes bones in the middle ear.  Blows to the femur could certainly cause significant damage to the torso, potentially fracturing the pelvis or causing internal injuries.  The stapes bones are located within the skull and a blow targeting them would likely not directly impact the torso. However, a blow hard enough to affect the stapes would almost certainly cause skull fracture and other traumatic head injuries which indirectly would affect the torso through overall trauma to the body.

1915,Can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight?,"The question asks if Centurylink's max internet plan allows for uploading 1000 GB in two weeks (a fortnight).  To answer this, we need information about Centurylink's max internet plan's upload speed and data cap.  Unfortunately, this information isn't provided in the prompt.  We can't determine if 1000GB can be uploaded in a fortnight without knowing the plan's specifications. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question.

1916,Did the color green help Theodor Geisel become famous?,"Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, is famous for his children's books.  The color green is not intrinsically linked to his fame. While his books feature various colors, there's no significant evidence suggesting that the color green played a crucial role in his success. His fame stems from his unique writing style, whimsical illustrations, and the enduring appeal of his stories.

Answer: {false}
"
1922,Would an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility result in a supersonic shock wave?,"The speed of a shock wave depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels (in this case, air) and the energy of the explosion.  While a large explosion like that at a gunpowder storage facility would generate a very powerful shockwave, it's not guaranteed to be supersonic.  The speed of sound in air is approximately 343 meters per second (767 mph).  The shockwave's speed would need to exceed this to be classified as supersonic.  The size of the explosion is a factor, but other conditions like atmospheric pressure and temperature also play a role in determining the shockwave's velocity.  A very large explosion *could* create a supersonic shockwave, but it's not inherently certain.

Answer: {false}

His skills with the bow and arrow are integral to many key events in these narratives.

Answer: {true}
"
1931,Can a snow leopard eat twice its own body weight?,"Snow leopards are known for their hunting prowess, but their prey is typically much smaller than themselves.  While they are powerful and efficient hunters, it's highly improbable that a snow leopard could consume a meal twice its own body weight in one sitting.  Their digestive systems are not designed for such large quantities of food at once.  They may consume a large proportion of their body weight in a single kill, but they would certainly not eat *twice* their weight.

Answer: {false}
"
1932,Is it expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla?,"Charla Nash was severely mauled by a chimpanzee named Travis in 2009.  This traumatic event resulted in extensive injuries and the need for a full face transplant.  Given the nature of the attack and its lasting psychological impact, it is highly probable that she would experience anxiety, fear, or even PTSD in the presence of a gorilla, another large primate.  The similarity in appearance could trigger a strong emotional response.

1937,Did number of Imams Reza Shah believed in exceed number of Jesus's disciples?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation:

The number of Jesus's disciples is generally understood to be twelve (the twelve apostles).  While the exact number of Imams Reza Shah believed in is difficult to definitively state and depends on interpretation of Shia Islam, it's unlikely to exceed twelve.  The twelve Imams in Shia Islam are a core tenet of the faith, but Reza Shah Pahlavi's personal beliefs are a separate matter and wouldn't necessarily involve belief in all twelve.  Even if he did believe in all twelve, this would still not exceed the number of Jesus's disciples.  Therefore, it's highly improbable that the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in exceeded twelve.
"
1938,Does chlorine inhibit photosynthesis?,"Chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent.  Photosynthesis relies on chlorophyll and other light-sensitive pigments within chloroplasts to absorb light energy and convert it into chemical energy.  Chlorine can damage these pigments and the cellular structures involved in photosynthesis, thereby inhibiting the process.  The extent of inhibition would depend on the concentration of chlorine and the duration of exposure.

1944,Are there multiple Disney Zorro?,"Walt Disney Productions produced a Zorro television series in the 1950s starring Guy Williams.  There have been other Zorro adaptations and portrayals in film and television since then, but no other *Disney* Zorro series of comparable scale and recognition. While there might be other interpretations of Zorro made by Disney, for example, a cartoon or short feature, the question implies a significant adaptation.  Therefore, focusing on major adaptations, there isn't a second Disney Zorro series comparable to the 1950s version.

1945,Is the Hobbit more profitable for proofreader than Constitution of the United States?,"The profitability for a proofreader working on either ""The Hobbit"" or the ""Constitution of the United States"" depends on several factors, including the proofreader's hourly rate, the length of the text, and the complexity of the work.  The Constitution is a significantly shorter document than ""The Hobbit.""  However, the potential for errors in a legal document like the Constitution might warrant a higher rate per word or hour.  ""The Hobbit,"" while longer, might have a simpler structure and less complex terminology.   Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say which would be more profitable without knowing the specific payment rates and time required for each job.

Answer: {false}
"
1946,Did any of the amazons on Xena: Warrior Princess star on later shows?,"Xena: Warrior Princess featured many recurring and guest actors.  Several of these actors went on to star in other shows after their time on Xena.  To definitively answer if *any* Amazons went on to star in later shows requires a comprehensive list of every Amazon character and their subsequent acting careers, which is beyond the scope of this response. However, given the popularity of the show and the acting careers of many involved, it's highly probable at least one Amazon actress appeared in other shows.

"
1949,Are red legs a sign of failing health in those with Anorexia Nervosa?,"Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by severely restricted food intake, leading to significantly low body weight.  One consequence of this severe calorie restriction is the body's attempt to conserve energy. This can manifest in several ways, including a redistribution of body fat and muscle mass.  While not a universally recognized or definitive symptom, a reduction in subcutaneous fat (fat just under the skin) can lead to a visible prominence of bones and veins, and potentially make legs appear thinner and possibly reddish due to the skin becoming thinner and more translucent, revealing underlying blood vessels.  This isn't a direct *cause* of failing health, but rather a visible sign of the *severe* undernourishment associated with a seriously advanced stage of anorexia nervosa.  Therefore, while red legs might be an indicator of a critical state and potential health failure in someone with anorexia, it's not a primary or defining sign.

Answer: {true}

1953,Would a body builder prefer an elk burger over a beef burger?,"Bodybuilders often prioritize lean protein sources with lower fat content.  While both elk and beef are good sources of protein, elk meat generally has a lower fat content and a higher protein-to-fat ratio compared to beef.  This makes elk a potentially more favorable choice for a bodybuilder focused on muscle growth and minimizing fat intake.  Therefore, a bodybuilder might prefer an elk burger.

1954,Can Aerosmith fit in a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?,"To determine if Aerosmith could fit in a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander, we need to consider the size of the band and the size of the vehicle.  Aerosmith has five members. A 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV. While it has seating for five, it's unlikely that five adult men, especially considering the average size of the band members, could comfortably fit in the vehicle, especially with their equipment. The space would be extremely cramped and potentially unsafe.

"
1967,Phileas Fogg's around the world would be difficult to achieve during Pope John Paul I's reign?,"Phileas Fogg's fictional journey around the world in 80 days, as depicted in Jules Verne's novel,  would be challenging to replicate regardless of the Pope's reign.  The difficulty stems from the time constraints and the modes of transportation available during the time period of the novel (late 19th century). While the Pope's reign (a few weeks in 1978) is irrelevant to the feasibility of the journey itself, it serves as a distraction. The real determining factors are the time it takes to travel around the world using the methods available during the novel’s setting.

"
1968,Can lettuce result in spontaneous abortion?,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that lettuce can cause spontaneous abortion.  Spontaneous abortions, or miscarriages, have various complex causes, primarily related to chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, hormonal imbalances, infections, or underlying health conditions in the mother.  Consuming lettuce, a common and generally safe food, is not linked to these causes.  While some individuals may have specific allergies or sensitivities to certain foods, there's no established connection between lettuce consumption and miscarriage risk.

"
1969,Can a software engineer work during a power outage?,"The ability of a software engineer to work during a power outage depends heavily on the type of work they're doing and the resources available to them.

If the work involves activities that require a computer and internet access, then a power outage would severely limit or completely prevent the software engineer from working.  This includes coding, testing, debugging, and many other common tasks.  Even if the engineer has a laptop with a battery, the battery life is finite, and internet access is likely dependent on a power source.

However, some tasks might still be possible.  A software engineer could potentially:

* **Work on documentation:** Writing reports, updating documentation, or creating diagrams could be done offline, using pen and paper or a laptop running off battery power.
* **Plan projects or tasks:**  Conceptual work, outlining strategies, or reviewing existing project plans could be accomplished without access to power.
* **Read technical books or articles:**  Offline access to learning materials could enable continued professional development.

Therefore, while certain aspects of a software engineer's job can be performed during a power outage, many crucial tasks require a power supply and internet connection, making it unlikely they can maintain full productivity.

1971,Is Sea World hazardous to leopard seal's health?,"Leopard seals are found in cold, Antarctic waters. SeaWorld, while having various marine animal exhibits, is unlikely to house leopard seals due to the immense difficulty and cost associated with maintaining their habitat requirements.  The specialized conditions needed to keep these animals healthy – extremely cold water, vast tank sizes, and a specific diet – are not typically replicated in SeaWorld environments. Therefore, it's unlikely that SeaWorld poses a direct hazard to leopard seals, primarily because they are not typically kept there.

Kaffir lime leaves are used primarily for their aromatic qualities and are not typically used in cocktails.  Their strong citrusy and slightly herbal flavor could clash with the other ingredients in a White Russian, potentially ruining the balance of the drink. While some experimentation is always possible, it's highly unlikely kaffir lime would be a good addition to this particular cocktail.

1979,Could a wandering albatross fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest?,"The wandering albatross has the largest wingspan of any bird, and is known for its incredible endurance in flight.  However, the distance between Bucharest, Romania and New York City is vast, exceeding the typical non-stop flight range of even a wandering albatross.  While they can cover immense distances at sea, their sustained flight is dependent on favorable winds and currents, which aren't guaranteed on a transatlantic journey.  The flight would require a huge amount of energy, and it's unlikely a wandering albatross could accomplish this without resting.

1983,Do Do It Yourself channels online always show realistic projects?,"DIY channels online vary widely in their approach to projects. Some focus on highly achievable projects with readily available materials, while others showcase more ambitious or complex undertakings.  The level of detail and skill required also varies greatly.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say that *all* DIY projects shown online are realistic for the average viewer. Many are aspirational, requiring specialized tools, skills, or significant time investment that most people don't possess.  Even projects presented as simple might omit crucial steps or details that could lead to failure for a novice.

1985,Would costumes with robes and pointy hats be helpful for Macbeth?,"Costumes with robes and pointy hats are stereotypical representations of witches and could be helpful for a production of Macbeth because the witches are a crucial element of the play.  Their costumes help establish their mysterious and supernatural presence, contributing to the overall atmosphere of the play.  Therefore, such costumes would be a relevant and potentially effective design choice.

"
1989,Could all the unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression fit in Tiger Stadium?,"To determine if all unemployed people during the Great Depression could fit in Tiger Stadium, we need to estimate the number of unemployed and the capacity of Tiger Stadium.

* **Unemployment during the Great Depression:**  The peak unemployment rate during the Great Depression was around 25% in 1933. The US population at the time was approximately 125 million.  This means roughly 31.25 million people were unemployed.

* **Tiger Stadium Capacity:**  The capacity of Tiger Stadium varies depending on the configuration, but it's generally in the range of 40,000 to 50,000 people. Let's use a generous estimate of 50,000.

**Comparison:**

The number of unemployed people (31.25 million) is vastly larger than the capacity of Tiger Stadium (50,000).  Therefore, all the unemployed people could not fit in Tiger Stadium.

"
1990,Did a Polish poet write sonnets about Islamic religion?,"There is no widely known or documented Polish poet who wrote sonnets specifically about the Islamic religion.  While Polish poets have certainly written about various religious and spiritual themes, and Poland has a history of interaction with Islamic cultures (though often fraught with conflict), a significant body of work dedicated to Islamic themes by a Polish poet in the sonnet form isn't readily apparent in literary history.  Further research into niche Polish literature might reveal a less prominent figure, but based on readily available information, this is highly unlikely.

"
1992,Is the Mona Lisa based on a real person?,"The identity of the sitter for the Mona Lisa has been a subject of much speculation and debate throughout history.  While there's no definitive proof, the most widely accepted theory is that the painting depicts Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant.  Historical documents and art historical analysis lend some credence to this theory, although other candidates have been proposed.  Therefore, while not conclusively proven, the evidence suggests the Mona Lisa is likely based on a real person.

1996,Would an ancient visitor to Persia probably consume crocus threads?,"Crocus threads, or saffron threads, are derived from the Crocus sativus plant. Saffron has been cultivated in Persia (modern-day Iran) for millennia and is a highly prized spice.  Its use in cooking and as a dye is well documented in ancient Persian texts and archaeological findings. Therefore, it's highly probable an ancient visitor to Persia would have encountered and possibly consumed crocus threads, either in food or as a dye.

1997,Could Durian cause someone's stomach to feel unwell?,"Durian is a fruit known for its pungent odor and strong, sometimes overpowering, taste.  While not inherently toxic, its unique composition can cause digestive upset in some individuals.  The high sulfur content contributes to its distinct smell and can lead to gas, bloating, and discomfort for those sensitive to it.  Additionally, the fruit is rich in fiber, which, while beneficial in moderation, can cause diarrhea or stomach cramps if consumed in large quantities. Therefore, it's plausible that consuming durian could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell.

1999,"For bone growth, is kale more beneficial than spinach?","Both kale and spinach are leafy green vegetables packed with nutrients essential for bone health, including vitamin K, calcium, and vitamin C.  However, kale generally contains higher amounts of vitamin K than spinach.  Vitamin K plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and may improve bone mineral density.  While spinach also offers bone-supporting nutrients, the higher vitamin K content in kale gives it a slight edge in terms of bone growth benefits.  It's important to note that both vegetables contribute to overall health and bone health as part of a balanced diet, and the difference may not be substantial for most individuals.

This directly references the character of Dr. Frank-N-Furter from the cult classic film *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*.  While *The Rocky Horror Show* (the stage musical upon which the film is based) is a jukebox musical in that it features original songs, there is no separate jukebox musical specifically centered around Dr. Frank-N-Furter that uses only pre-existing songs.  The songs in *The Rocky Horror Show* are original to the production.

"
2010,Can French Defence initial move defend against four move checkmate?,"The four-move checkmate, also known as the Fool's Mate, relies on a specific sequence of moves by White.  It involves moving the f-pawn two squares forward, then the bishop to c4, then the queen to h5, and finally checkmating with the queen to h2.

Black's opening move with the French Defence is typically 1... e6, controlling the center and preparing to develop the queenside.  This move does *not* directly interfere with the sequence of moves that lead to the Fool's Mate.  While the French Defence aims for a solid and controlled game, it doesn't prevent the Fool's Mate if Black plays inaccurately. The Fool's Mate relies on completely passive moves from Black and improper development of pieces.

Therefore, the French Defense, while a strong opening, does not inherently prevent the four-move checkmate. It is possible for Black to be checkmated in four moves even after using the French Defense if they make the wrong moves.

While some individuals exhibit overt signs of sadness, tearfulness, or withdrawal, others may experience grief more subtly, perhaps through anger, irritability, or changes in appetite or sleep patterns.  The outward expression of grief is heavily influenced by cultural norms, personal coping mechanisms, and individual personality.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to assume that grief is always readily apparent.

2018,Could someone listen to the entire U2 debut studio album during an episode of Peppa Pig?,"Here's how we can determine if a listener could complete U2's debut album, ""Boy,"" during a single episode of Peppa Pig:

First, we need to estimate the length of a typical Peppa Pig episode and the length of U2's ""Boy"" album.

* **Peppa Pig Episode Length:**  A typical Peppa Pig episode is around 5 minutes long.

* **U2's ""Boy"" Album Length:** The album ""Boy"" is approximately 40 minutes long.


Since a 5-minute Peppa Pig episode is significantly shorter than the 40-minute album, it is impossible to listen to the entire album during a single episode.

2021,Could Buzz Aldrin have owned a computer?,"Buzz Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 mission which landed on the moon in 1969.  While personal computers as we know them today didn't exist in widespread use until the 1970s and 80s, computers did exist in 1969, albeit large, expensive, and generally only available to governments, universities, and large corporations.  It's highly unlikely that Aldrin owned a personal computer in the style of a modern PC, but it's plausible that he may have had access to or even used a mainframe computer for scientific calculations or other work related to the space program.  Therefore, the statement ""Buzz Aldrin could have owned a computer"" is ambiguous depending on the definition of ""computer"".  If we are considering a large, expensive, mainframe-style computer accessible to a person in his position, then the answer is likely true.  If we are considering a personal computer like those available to the general public today, then the answer is likely false. To resolve the ambiguity, let's assume ""computer"" refers to the broadest possible definition.

2022,Do urban legends always have to occur in cities?,"The term ""urban legend"" refers to a story that is widely circulated as true but is actually false.  The ""urban"" part refers to the setting where these stories are often told and spread – typically in cities or densely populated areas because these environments foster rapid and widespread communication.  However,  the stories themselves don't have to *occur* in a city;  they can be set in rural areas, or even fantastical locations. The key element is the widespread, often informal transmission of the untrue story.

Barbas, from Charmed, is a powerful demon, but his power is largely limited to manipulating emotions and causing mischief.  While Barbas has some magical abilities, they don't seem to match the scale or raw power demonstrated by Gandalf.  Gandalf's experience in facing down powerful, ancient evils suggests he would be a superior opponent to Barbas.

2032,Would Jean Harris's victim have avoided lentils?,"Jean Harris was convicted of murdering Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower.  The Scarsdale Diet, which Tarnower created, was a very low-calorie diet that severely restricted carbohydrates and fats. Lentils are a high-protein, high-carbohydrate legume.  Therefore, it's highly likely that Dr. Tarnower, as the creator of the Scarsdale Diet, would have avoided lentils as part of his own restrictive dietary regimen.

2033,Was a person sold a Creative Commons License for Boticelli's The Birth of Venus ripped off?,"Explanation:
Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus"" is in the public domain.  Creative Commons licenses are used to grant rights to works that are *not* in the public domain.  Since ""The Birth of Venus"" is already free for anyone to use, purchasing a Creative Commons license for it would be unnecessary and a waste of money.  Therefore, the person was ripped off.

2034,Would United States Air Force consider Return of the Jedi's Han Solo bad hypothetical candidate?,"The United States Air Force values qualities like leadership, discipline, strategic thinking, and a proven track record of success in high-pressure situations.  While Han Solo displays some of these qualities (courage, resourcefulness), he also exhibits significant flaws that would likely disqualify him as a candidate for any serious position within the Air Force.  These flaws include a history of recklessness, disregard for rules and regulations, a tendency toward impulsive behavior, and a criminal past.  Even his eventual heroism is largely fueled by self-interest and personal relationships.  The Air Force seeks candidates who are reliable, follow orders, and operate within a strict chain of command, all areas where Han Solo consistently falls short.

2038,Did Van Gogh suffer from a mental disorder?,"Vincent van Gogh's life was marked by periods of intense emotional instability and erratic behavior. While a definitive diagnosis is impossible posthumously, his symptoms, including profound sadness, anxiety, episodes of intense agitation, and auditory hallucinations, strongly suggest a mental illness.  He experienced several hospitalizations and was known to self-harm.  Historians and psychiatrists have proposed various diagnoses, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, though no single conclusion is universally accepted.  However, the overwhelming evidence points to a significant mental health condition impacting his life and work.

2040,Are Saturn's famous rings solid?,"Saturn's rings are not solid structures.  They are composed of countless icy particles, ranging in size from tiny dust grains to house-sized boulders. These particles orbit Saturn individually, creating the appearance of continuous rings.  Therefore, the rings are a massive collection of independent objects, not a single, solid entity.

Answer: {false}
"
2041,Do you need both hot and cold water to peel a tomato?,"To peel a tomato, you need to use hot water to loosen the skin.  Cold water isn't strictly necessary for the peeling process itself, although a quick dip in cold water after the hot water treatment can help stop the cooking process and make the skin easier to remove. Therefore, while hot water is essential, cold water is optional.

Answer: {false}
"
2042,Would a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer be shunned by their Amish cousins?,"Amish people have a very strict dress code, characterized by plainness and simplicity.  They shun modern fashions and luxury items. A Dolce & Gabbana suit is a high-fashion, expensive garment, clearly contrasting with Amish values and attire. Therefore, an Amish person wearing such a suit would be highly unusual and likely to face significant social repercussions within their community.

2044,Is Great Pyramid of Giza the last wonder of its kind?,"The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.  However, it's the *only* one that still largely exists in its original form.  The other six have been significantly damaged or destroyed over time.  Therefore, while it's not the ""last"" wonder in the sense of being the most recently built, it is the last remaining wonder in a largely intact state, making it unique among its peers.

Answer: {true}
"
2045,Was Alexander the Great baptized?,"Alexander the Great was born and raised in ancient Greece, a society that practiced pagan religions.  Christianity, and therefore baptism as a Christian rite, did not exist during his lifetime.  Therefore, it's impossible for him to have been baptized.

"
2050,Are coopers required in the beverage industry?,"Coopers, traditionally skilled barrel-makers, are not universally required in the modern beverage industry. While their craft was essential for aging and storing beverages like wine and beer in wooden barrels, many modern beverage producers utilize alternative methods such as stainless steel tanks, glass containers, and other non-wooden vessels.  Therefore, while coopers might be employed by some beverage companies, particularly those specializing in traditional methods or certain types of aged products, their presence isn't a mandatory requirement across the board.

Answer: {false}
"
2051,Were any of despised Pope Alexander VI's descendants canonized?,"Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) was a controversial figure known for nepotism and corruption.  His children, Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, were particularly infamous for their involvement in political intrigue and violence.  While their lives were certainly eventful and their stories are well known, neither Cesare nor Lucrezia Borgia were canonized.  Canonization is the process by which the Catholic Church declares a person a saint. Given the significant moral failings attributed to Alexander VI and his children, their canonization would be highly unlikely.  Therefore, it's safe to conclude that no descendants of Alexander VI were canonized.

Answer: {false}
"
2052,Can a student from Smithtown's Cleary School understand the speech of a French person?,"The question asks whether a student from Smithtown's Cleary School can understand the speech of a French person.  This depends entirely on whether the student has learned French. There's no inherent connection between attending Cleary School in Smithtown and French language proficiency.  Some students might have taken French as a foreign language, others might not.  Therefore, it's impossible to definitively answer the question without more information about the specific student.

2054,Did Terry Pratchett write about quantum mechanics?,"Terry Pratchett's Discworld series incorporates fantasy elements and satire, often using scientific concepts as analogies or humorous points of contrast.  While he doesn't delve into the complex mathematical equations of quantum mechanics, his writing often touches upon concepts related to probability, chance, and the nature of reality in ways that could be loosely interpreted as reflecting some aspects of quantum theory.  However, he never explicitly attempts a serious or detailed exploration of quantum mechanics as a scientific field.

"
2057,Could Maroon 5 have hypothetically held a concert at Roman Colosseum?,"Explanation:
The Roman Colosseum is an ancient amphitheater in Rome, Italy.  Maroon 5 is a contemporary American pop band. While the Colosseum could theoretically host concerts today (although it's not typically used for that purpose and would require significant logistical arrangements), Maroon 5's existence is firmly within the modern era, long after the Colosseum's use as an amphitheater ended.  Therefore, a concert by Maroon 5 at the Roman Colosseum in the way we understand modern concerts would not be possible.


Answer: {false}
"
2058,Is Cookie Monster's diet Paleo friendly?,"The Paleo diet emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and nuts, while avoiding processed foods, grains, and dairy.  Cookie Monster's diet primarily consists of cookies, which are highly processed and contain refined sugar, flour, and often dairy and other ingredients not allowed on the Paleo diet. Therefore, Cookie Monster's diet is not Paleo-friendly.

"
2061,Did Millard Fillmore help to establish the University of Pittsburgh?,"Millard Fillmore's presidency (1850-1853) predates the establishment of the University of Pittsburgh's modern form.  While the University of Pittsburgh has a long history dating back to 1787,  it wasn't until much later, in 1908, that it formally became the University of Pittsburgh. Therefore, Millard Fillmore could not have played a role in establishing the University of Pittsburgh as it exists today.

Answer: {false}
"
2062,Is Christianity better for global warming than Satanism?,"Neither Christianity nor Satanism, as organized religions or belief systems, have inherent policies or practices directly aimed at mitigating global warming.  The impact on the environment stems from the actions of individual adherents, not the doctrines themselves.  While some Christians may engage in environmentally conscious practices due to their interpretation of stewardship, others may not.  Similarly, the actions of Satanists regarding environmental issues are diverse and not dictated by their religious beliefs. Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say one is ""better"" than the other concerning global warming.  It depends entirely on the individual actions of believers within each group.

Answer: {false}
"
2063,Was Robert Downey Jr. a good role model as a young man?,"Robert Downey Jr.'s early life and career were marked by significant struggles with substance abuse and legal troubles.  This behavior would not be considered exemplary or indicative of a positive role model for young people. While he has since achieved sobriety and a successful acting career, his younger years were characterized by actions that are generally viewed as irresponsible and harmful.

"
2065,Is Newt Gingrich's nickname a type of Reptile?,"Newt Gingrich's nickname is ""Newt"".  ""Newt"" is a common name for a type of amphibian, specifically a newt.  Newts are amphibians, not reptiles.  While both amphibians and reptiles are ectothermic (cold-blooded) and have certain similarities, they are distinct classes of vertebrates.

Answer: {false}
"
2066,Did Christopher Columbus break the fifth commandment in Christianity?,"The Fifth Commandment in Christianity is ""Honor thy father and thy mother.""  While there's no direct evidence suggesting Christopher Columbus directly disobeyed this commandment through actions against his own parents, his actions towards the indigenous populations of the Americas could be interpreted as a violation of the commandment's broader spirit.  The commandment isn't just about familial obedience, but also about respecting authority and treating others with dignity.  Columbus's brutality, enslavement, and exploitation of the native populations could be viewed as a profound lack of respect for their inherent human dignity, which some might argue is a transgression against the principle underlying the Fifth Commandment.  The interpretation is subjective and depends on how broadly one defines ""honor.""

Answer: {true}
"
2067,Can a Reconstruction era coin buy DJI Mavic Pro Drone?,"Here's an explanation to determine whether a Reconstruction-era coin could buy a DJI Mavic Pro drone:

To answer this question, we need to consider the following:

1. **Purchasing power of Reconstruction-era coins:**  The purchasing power of a coin from the Reconstruction era (roughly 1865-1877) would be significantly less than its face value today due to inflation.  Even a gold coin, while holding intrinsic value, would not command the same purchasing power as it did 150 years ago.

2. **Cost of a DJI Mavic Pro drone:** The DJI Mavic Pro drone has a relatively high price.  The exact cost would depend on the specific model and retailer but we can safely assume it would cost thousands of dollars.

3. **Inflation:**  The cumulative effect of inflation over more than a century makes it highly unlikely that even a large sum of Reconstruction-era currency could purchase a modern drone.

Therefore, based on the vast difference in purchasing power between the era of the coin and the present day, it's highly improbable that a single Reconstruction-era coin could buy a DJI Mavic Pro drone.

Answer: {false}
"
2068,Is week old chlorine water safe to drink?,"Chlorine is added to water to kill harmful bacteria and viruses.  However, chlorine itself is a chemical and its effectiveness diminishes over time.  A week-old chlorine solution will have a significantly reduced chlorine concentration, meaning its ability to disinfect is greatly compromised.  This leaves the water vulnerable to recontamination by bacteria and other pathogens. Therefore, drinking week-old chlorinated water is unsafe.

"
2070,Is a paraplegic suitable for conducting an orchestra?,"Answer: A paraplegic individual's ability to conduct an orchestra depends entirely on the specific nature of their paralysis and their adaptability.  While some might have limited mobility in their arms and hands, impacting their ability to wield a baton and make precise movements, many paraplegics possess sufficient upper body strength and dexterity to conduct.  Adaptive techniques, such as specialized conducting equipment or alternative methods of communication with the orchestra, could also overcome physical limitations.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to make a blanket statement about suitability.  Some paraplegics would be perfectly capable, while others might find it challenging or impossible.

Answer: {false}
"
2071,Can 1980 United States presidential election result be considered a photo finish?,"The 1980 United States presidential election saw Ronald Reagan win a landslide victory over incumbent Jimmy Carter.  Reagan won 44 states to Carter's 6, and secured 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49.  This was not a close election; the margin of victory was substantial. A ""photo finish"" implies an extremely close result, requiring close scrutiny to determine the winner.  Therefore, the 1980 election cannot be considered a photo finish.

Answer: {false}
"
2072,Is a fever cured by listening to a cowbell?,"Answer: There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that listening to a cowbell cures a fever.  Fevers are caused by infections or other illnesses, and require medical treatment to address the underlying cause.  Listening to a cowbell has no impact on the body's immune response or the physiological processes causing the fever.

Answer: {false}
"
2073,Can a single honey bee sting multiple humans?,"A honeybee's stinger is barbed.  When a honeybee stings a human, the stinger becomes embedded in the skin, along with the venom sac and some of the bee's internal organs. This action rips the stinger and attached organs from the bee's abdomen, fatally injuring the bee.  Therefore, a single honeybee can only sting once.

Answer: {false}
"
2074,Could Bob Marley's children hypothetically win tug of war against Kublai Khan's children?,"Answer: Bob Marley had 11 children.  The exact number of Kublai Khan's children is debated by historians, but it's generally accepted he had numerous children, likely less than 11.  Even if Kublai Khan had a larger number of children, the ages of Bob Marley's children at various points in their lives would have created situations where 11 children, depending on their ages and strength, could potentially defeat a smaller group, or even a larger group of younger children.  Tug-of-war depends on strength and coordination, not solely on numbers.  Therefore, it's possible, though not certain, for Bob Marley's children to win.

Answer: {true}
"
2075,Did Harry Houdini's wife make psychics look foolish?,"Explanation:
Bess Houdini, Harry Houdini's wife, was known for her skepticism towards psychics and mediums.  After Houdini's death, she actively debunked fraudulent psychics who claimed to communicate with him.  She used her platform and influence to expose their tricks and methods, thus making them look foolish.

Answer: {true}
"
2076,Did Joan Crawford guest star on  JAG (TV series)?,"Joan Crawford's career spanned several decades, but it concluded before the JAG TV series began airing.  JAG premiered in 1995, and Joan Crawford passed away in 1977. Therefore, she could not have guest starred on the show.

Answer: {false}
"
2077,Do some home remedies result in your skin color turning blue?,"Silver nitrate is a chemical compound that can be used in some home remedies, though it's not commonly recommended due to its toxicity.  When silver nitrate comes into contact with skin, it can cause a condition called argyria, which results in a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin. This discoloration is permanent.  While not a common home remedy, the possibility exists that its use could lead to blue skin.

Answer: {true}
"
2078,Did the Berlin Wall prevent any athletes from competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics?,"The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany.  The Berlin Wall was not built until 1961, long after the 1936 Olympics. Therefore, the Berlin Wall could not have prevented any athletes from competing in the 1936 Games.

Answer: {false}
"
2079,Is Batman (1989 film) likely to be shown on flight from NY to Kansas City?,"In-flight entertainment varies greatly depending on the airline.  However, older films like Batman (1989) are frequently included in airline movie selections due to their enduring popularity and broad appeal.  The film's length is also manageable for a flight of that duration.  Therefore, it is quite likely, though not guaranteed, that it would be shown.

Answer: {true}
"
2080,Has Don King killed more people than Charles Manson did with his own hands in 1971?,"Answer: Don King's involvement in violent deaths is connected to his boxing promotion career, with allegations and convictions related to manslaughter and other violent incidents.  Charles Manson, on the other hand, was directly convicted of conspiracy to commit murders. While it's impossible to definitively say how many people Don King is responsible for killing, the evidence strongly suggests that he's not responsible for more deaths with his own hands than Charles Manson.  Although there are accusations of violence linked to Don King, Manson was directly involved and responsible for multiple deaths.  Therefore, the statement is likely false.

Answer: {false}
"
2081,Could amoebas have played a part in the Black Death?,"The Black Death, primarily caused by *Yersinia pestis*, was spread through fleas that lived on rodents.  While amoebas themselves aren't directly linked to the transmission of *Yersinia pestis*,  it's possible to theorize indirect roles.  For example, amoebas could have provided a niche or environment within a rodent's body where the bacteria could thrive or be protected. However, there is no strong scientific evidence suggesting amoebas played a significant role in the spread of the Black Death. The primary vector was the flea, and the primary cause was the bacterium.  Any involvement of amoebas would be highly indirect and speculative.

Answer: {false}
"
2082,Does Ludacris have Greek heritage?,"Ludacris's ancestry has been publicly discussed to include African-American heritage.  There's no readily available information suggesting Greek ancestry.

2084,Could the Pope be on an episode of Pimp My Ride?,"The premise of ""Pimp My Ride"" is to customize and upgrade vehicles for deserving individuals.  While the Pope is a highly influential figure, he is not known for needing or wanting a customized vehicle.  His transportation is typically provided through the Vatican.  The idea of the Pope participating in a show focused on car modification is highly improbable.

Answer: {false}
"
2085,Can an African Elephant get pregnant twice in a year?,"African elephants have a gestation period of approximately 22 months.  This means that it takes over two years for a pregnancy to come to term.  Therefore, it's biologically impossible for an African elephant to get pregnant twice in a single year.

Answer: {false}
"
2086,Did Hamlet's author use email?,"The author of Hamlet, William Shakespeare, lived from 1564 to 1616. Email was invented centuries later.  Therefore, Shakespeare could not have used email.

Answer: {false}
"
2087,Could a newborn look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant?,"Horseradish plants typically grow to a height of 1-2 feet (30-60 cm).  A newborn baby is very small, lying generally around 20 inches (50cm) in length.  While a newborn's head is relatively large in proportion to their body, it is unlikely that a newborn would be able to look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant due to the average heights of both.  The baby's ability to lift their head would also need to be taken into account.


Answer: {false}
"
2088,Is Cambodia too expensive for 2020 richest billionaire to own?,"Explanation:
The question asks if Cambodia is too expensive for the richest billionaire in 2020 to own.  This is a nonsensical question.  One cannot ""own"" a country.  The question conflates personal wealth with national sovereignty. Even the wealthiest individual in the world could not purchase or take ownership of an entire nation.  Therefore, the answer must be false.

Answer: {false}
"
2089,Will a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell balance out a giant scale?,"Explanation:
To determine if a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell would balance a giant scale, we need to compare their weights.  A Holstein cow typically weighs between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds. The Liberty Bell weighs approximately 2,080 pounds.  Therefore, the combined weight of a Holstein cow and the Liberty Bell would significantly exceed the weight of either alone.  They would not balance each other on a scale.

Answer: {false}
"
2090,Did Cleopatra have ethnicity closer to Egyptians than Greeks?,"Cleopatra VII Philopator was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt.  While she was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, her lineage was Macedonian Greek, tracing back to Ptolemy I Soter, one of Alexander the Great's generals.  Although she ruled Egypt and presented herself as a pharaoh, adopting Egyptian customs and religious practices, her ethnicity was fundamentally Greek. Therefore, her ethnicity was closer to Greek than to Egyptian.

Answer: {false}
"
2091,Can ham make a cut seal up quicker?,"Ham contains salt, and salt is a known astringent. Astringents cause tissues to contract, which can help to stop bleeding and promote clotting.  While applying ham directly to a cut is not a medically recommended practice due to hygiene concerns and potential for infection, the salt content *could* theoretically contribute to faster clotting. However, this effect would be minimal compared to proper wound care techniques and is not a reliable or safe method.

Answer: {true}
"
2092,Can COVID-19 spread to maritime pilots?,"COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  Maritime pilots, like any other human being, are susceptible to respiratory illnesses.  They interact with crew members of various vessels, potentially exposing them to the virus.  Therefore, it is entirely possible for COVID-19 to spread to maritime pilots.

Answer: {true}
"
2093,Would a duke hypothetically be subservient to a Tsar?,"Answer: A Tsar is the title of a Russian emperor.  A Duke is a nobleman of high rank in various European countries.  Historically, there was no formal relationship of subservience between the two titles.  While a Tsar might exert political influence or even military power over a Duke's territory, the Duke wouldn't be inherently subservient in a way akin to a vassal to a king.  The relationship would depend on the specific political context and historical period.  Therefore, it's not a universally true statement.

Answer: {false}
"
2094,Are all twins the same gender?,"Answer: Fraternal twins can be different genders, while identical twins are always the same gender.  Therefore, not all twins are the same gender.

2096,Is Jack Black unlikely to compete with Bear McCreary for an award?,"Jack Black is primarily known as an actor and comedian, while Bear McCreary is a composer known for his work in film and television scores.  They operate in entirely different fields of entertainment and therefore are unlikely to compete for the same awards.  While there might be extremely rare exceptions (e.g., a very unusual award show), generally, their careers don't overlap in a way that would put them in competition.

Answer: {true}
"
2097,Is eggplant deadly to most atopic individuals?,"Answer: Eggplant, like many other nightshade plants, contains compounds that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals.  However, it's not deadly to *most* atopic individuals.  Atopic individuals are those with a tendency toward allergic conditions, but the severity of allergic reactions varies widely. While some atopic individuals might experience mild symptoms like skin rashes or digestive upset from eggplant,  a fatal reaction is rare.  A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is possible, but this is not the norm and requires a significant level of sensitization.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to say eggplant is deadly to *most* atopic individuals.

Answer: {false}
"
2098,Could you go to New York Public Library and the Six Flags Great Escape in the same day?,"The New York Public Library is located in New York City. Six Flags Great Escape is located in Queensbury, New York, which is approximately a 3-hour drive from New York City, depending on traffic.  Even with optimal travel conditions, the travel time alone would make it impossible to visit both locations in a single day.  This does not account for time spent at either location.

"
2100,Is there radiation where Nikola Tesla once worked?,"Nikola Tesla worked in various locations throughout his life, including his laboratory in New York City and Colorado Springs.  While some of his experiments involved high-voltage electricity, which could potentially produce ionizing radiation, there's no evidence suggesting persistent, dangerous levels of radiation remain at these locations today.  The types of radiation produced by his experiments would have been largely transient and decayed quickly.  Modern building materials and environmental factors would also significantly reduce any residual radiation.  Therefore, it is unlikely there is significant or harmful radiation at sites where Nikola Tesla once worked.

Answer: {true}
"
2108,Would the chef at La Grenouille find salsa to be a strange request?,"La Grenouille is a classic, Michelin-starred French restaurant known for its elegant, traditional French cuisine.  Salsa, a condiment originating from Mexican cuisine, is not typically found on a French menu, and would likely be considered unconventional or out of place in such a fine dining establishment. Therefore, the chef at La Grenouille would likely find a request for salsa to be unusual or strange.

2109,Does Abdulqawi Yusuf go to the Hague on a typical work day?,"Abdulqawi Yusuf is a prominent international lawyer who served as the President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) from 2018 to 2021.  The ICJ is located in The Hague, Netherlands.  As President, and even as a judge before that,  his work would have required him to be in The Hague on most typical workdays.

Answer: {true}
"
2110,Is it understandable to compare a blood spatter pattern to a Jackson Pollock piece?,"Jackson Pollock's drip paintings are characterized by their chaotic and unpredictable nature, with paint splattered and dripped onto the canvas in seemingly random patterns.  Blood spatter patterns, similarly, can exhibit a wide range of shapes and distributions depending on the force and angle of impact, the type of weapon used, and other factors. Both involve the unpredictable dispersal of a substance (paint or blood) across a surface.  While the underlying mechanisms are vastly different, the resulting visual effect—a complex pattern created by the uncontrolled distribution of a material—shares a superficial resemblance.  The comparison is valid on a purely aesthetic level, acknowledging the significant differences in the cause and meaning of the patterns.

Answer: {true}
"
2111,Can the city of Miami fit inside Uppsala?,"To determine if Miami fits inside Uppsala, we need to compare their areas.  We'll need to find reliable data on the land area of each city.  The area of Miami is relatively easy to find, but Uppsala's built-up area might be less consistently defined depending on the source and definition used.  We'll need to find a comparable metric for both cities, ideally the area of the urban area or built-up area.  If the area of Miami's urban area is smaller than Uppsala's urban area, then Miami could theoretically fit inside Uppsala. However, this is only a theoretical fit, ignoring practical considerations like geography and the distribution of land in each city.

Answer: {true}
"
2113,As of 2020 have more women succeeded John Key than preceded him?,"John Key was the 38th Prime Minister of New Zealand.  To determine if more women have succeeded him than preceded him, we need to consider the Prime Ministers before and after his term.  While a definitive list requires checking official records, a quick search indicates that several women have held the office of Prime Minister in New Zealand *after* John Key.  It's highly unlikely that more women served *before* him, given the historical context of female representation in political leadership.

Answer: {true}
"
2114,Can a microwave melt a Toyota Prius battery?,"Microwave ovens work by generating electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range, which causes water molecules to vibrate and generate heat.  While this can be effective at heating food, it's not designed to generate the kind of intense, focused heat needed to melt the components of a Toyota Prius battery.  Prius batteries are sophisticated lithium-ion batteries, and the materials and their construction are designed to withstand a wide range of temperatures.  A standard household microwave's output is simply not powerful enough to overcome the thermal protection mechanisms and melt the battery.  Even if some localized heating occurred, it is highly unlikely that the entire battery would melt.

Answer: {false}
"
2115,Did J. P. Morgan have healthy lungs?,"J.P. Morgan's health is a matter of historical record, and while details about his specific lung health aren't extensively documented in readily available sources, accounts suggest he suffered from various health issues throughout his life, including heart problems.  There's no strong evidence to suggest he had particularly healthy lungs.  The lack of evidence of healthy lungs, coupled with the knowledge of other health concerns, makes it unlikely he possessed exceptionally healthy lungs.

Answer: {false}

"
2117,Can a wheelbarrow full of starch kill hyperglycemics?,"Explanation:
A wheelbarrow full of starch contains a large amount of carbohydrates.  Carbohydrates break down into glucose in the body. Hyperglycemia is a condition characterized by high blood glucose levels.  Ingesting a large quantity of starch would drastically increase blood glucose levels, potentially causing dangerous complications or even death in someone with hyperglycemia, especially if they are unable to regulate their blood sugar effectively.  Therefore, a wheelbarrow full of starch could be lethal to someone with hyperglycemia.

Answer: {true}
"
2118,Could the Austrian casualties from Seven Years' War fit in Indianapolis Motor Speedway?,"The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has a capacity of around 257,000 people.  To determine if the Austrian casualties from the Seven Years' War could fit, we need to estimate the number of Austrian casualties.  Reliable figures for total Austrian casualties during the Seven Years' War are difficult to find, and vary depending on the source and definition of ""casualty"" (killed, wounded, captured, etc.). However, estimates generally range in the tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands.  Even a high estimate of, say, 80,000 casualties is far less than the seating capacity of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  Therefore, the Austrian casualties from the Seven Years' War could easily fit inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

Answer: {true}

Therefore, a loaf of bread would be heavier than the physical manifestation of World of Warcraft.

Answer: {false}
"
2122,Are right wing Amreicans opposed to marxism?,"Answer: Right-wing Americans generally adhere to capitalist ideologies, emphasizing individual liberty and free markets. Marxism, on the other hand, advocates for a classless society and collective ownership of the means of production, fundamentally contrasting with right-wing principles.  Therefore, it's highly probable that right-wing Americans would be opposed to Marxism.

Answer: {true}
"

2126,Do Shinto practitioners keep to a kosher diet?,"Shinto is a Japanese religion that focuses on the veneration of *kami*, spirits associated with natural objects and phenomena.  It doesn't have dietary restrictions or commandments like kosher laws which are central to Judaism.  Kosher dietary laws prescribe specific rules about what foods can be eaten and how they must be prepared.  There's no overlap or connection between these two systems of belief and practice.

Answer: {false}
"
2127,Does the texture of leaves remain the same independent of their coloring changing?,"Leaf texture is determined by the structure of the leaf's cells and tissues, including the epidermis, mesophyll, and veins.  The process of changing leaf color (typically in the autumn) is primarily due to the breakdown of chlorophyll and the increased visibility of other pigments like carotenoids and anthocyanins.  These changes in pigmentation do not significantly alter the fundamental structure of the leaf's cells and tissues. While some minor changes in cell structure might occur as a result of the senescence process (aging), the overall texture —smooth, rough, leathery, etc.— generally remains relatively consistent.

Answer: {true}
"
2128,Does Sam Harris worship Shiva?,"Sam Harris is a prominent neuroscientist, philosopher, and author known for his work on atheism, skepticism, and moral philosophy.  His public persona and writings strongly suggest he does not adhere to any religious beliefs, including Hinduism, of which Shiva is a major deity.  There's no evidence to suggest he worships Shiva or any other deity.

Answer: {false}
"
2129,Is the tree species that the name Leipzig refers to an evergeen tree?,"The question is ambiguous.  ""Leipzig"" is a city in Germany, not a tree species. There is no tree species commonly known by that name.  Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether such a tree would be evergreen or not.

Answer: {false}
"
2130,Does acupuncture cause pain in many people?,"Acupuncture involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. While some people experience minimal or no discomfort, many others report varying degrees of pain, ranging from mild to moderate.  The level of pain can depend on factors such as the individual's pain tolerance, the location of the needles, the depth of insertion, and the skill of the acupuncturist.  Therefore, it's accurate to say that acupuncture causes pain in *many* people, although the intensity varies significantly.

Answer: {true}

"
2132,"If one of your feet is in a leg cast, should the other be in a sandal?","A leg cast restricts movement and mobility on one leg.  Wearing a sandal on the other foot wouldn't directly cause harm, but it might not be the most practical or comfortable choice.  The individual may experience imbalance or discomfort due to the difference in foot support and mobility. While there's no inherent danger in wearing a sandal, it's not necessarily the ideal footwear choice given the circumstances.  A more supportive shoe might be preferable to help maintain balance and reduce the risk of further injury.

Answer: {false}
"
2133,Would food made with black salt smell of sulfur?,"Black salt, also known as Kala Namak, contains sulfur compounds which give it a distinct smell reminiscent of sulfur or rotten eggs.  Therefore, food cooked with black salt will likely have a noticeable sulfurous smell.

Answer: {true}
"
2134,Would the average Hawaiian male experience more days on Earth compared to a wild cane toad?,"Explanation:

The average lifespan of a Hawaiian male is significantly longer than that of a wild cane toad.  While precise average lifespans can vary depending on the specific study and factors like health conditions and environment, human lifespans are measured in decades, whereas cane toads typically live for a much shorter period, usually only a few years.  Therefore, the average Hawaiian male would experience far more days on Earth.

Answer: {true}
"
2135,Did eggs need to be kept cold in the middle ages?,"Refrigeration as we know it did not exist in the Middle Ages.  Eggs were preserved using various methods, such as pickling, salting, or storing them in cool, dark places like cellars.  While these methods helped to extend their shelf life, they didn't require refrigeration in the modern sense. Therefore, eggs did not *need* to be kept cold in the way we do today.

Answer: {false}
"
2136,Do people with swallowing disorders need high viscosity drinks?,"People with swallowing disorders, or dysphagia, often have difficulty moving food or liquid from their mouth to their stomach.  High viscosity drinks, meaning thicker liquids, are often recommended because they are easier to swallow and less likely to cause aspiration (food or liquid entering the lungs).  This is because thicker liquids tend to stick together and create a more cohesive bolus (mass) which is easier to control during the swallowing process.  Therefore, people with swallowing disorders frequently *do* need high viscosity drinks.


Answer: {true}
"
2137,Is Krishna similar to Holy Spirit?,"Answer: {False}

Explanation:

While both Krishna and the Holy Spirit represent divine aspects within their respective belief systems, they are not directly comparable.  The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Christian Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), a single entity within a unified God.  Krishna, in Hinduism, is an avatar (incarnation) of the supreme god Vishnu, one among many manifestations within a broader pantheon of deities.  Their roles, attributes, and theologies surrounding them differ significantly, making a direct comparison inaccurate.  Similarities may exist in their roles as guides or sources of spiritual wisdom, but their fundamental natures and contexts within their respective belief systems are distinct.
"
2138,Was the Treaty of Versailles settled over blueberry scones?,"The Treaty of Versailles was a political agreement, signed after the First World War, that dealt with the consequences of the war.  There is no historical record or evidence to suggest that the treaty's negotiations or settlement involved blueberry scones or any other food item in a significant way.  The negotiations were complex and involved numerous political figures and decisions, focusing on territorial changes, reparations, and the establishment of the League of Nations.

2139,Are Disney's seven dwarves the original ones?,"The seven dwarfs in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are a creation of Disney animators.  While the fairy tale of Snow White predates Disney, the specific names and personalities of the seven dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey) are original to the Disney film.  There's no original set of seven dwarfs from the original fairy tale.

"
2140,"In most Mennonite homes, would children know of The Powerpuff Girls?","The Powerpuff Girls is a popular cartoon show with widespread distribution and appeal.  While Mennonite communities vary in their levels of engagement with popular culture, it's highly likely that many Mennonite children would have access to television and therefore be familiar with The Powerpuff Girls, either through their own viewing or through exposure at the homes of friends or relatives.  The show's widespread availability makes it improbable that children in most Mennonite homes would be entirely unaware of it.

Answer: {true}
"
2141,Is Capricorn the hypothetical zodiac sign of Satanism?,"Answer: There is no evidence linking the zodiac sign Capricorn to Satanism.  Satanism, in its various forms, does not typically associate itself with astrological signs.  While some individuals might personally connect Capricorn to Satanic imagery or themes, this is not a widely held belief or association within Satanism itself.  The zodiac signs are associated with different personality traits, not with religious affiliations.

"
2143,Does Hanuman have some of the same duties as Athena?,"Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god, is known for his strength, loyalty, and devotion to Rama.  He often acts as a messenger, protector, and warrior, undertaking difficult tasks for his master.  He displays intelligence and resourcefulness in achieving his goals.

Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, warfare, crafts, and strategic battle, is also known for her intelligence, strategic thinking, and protective nature.  She often acts as a guide and advisor to heroes, helping them achieve victory in battle and other endeavors.

While their mythologies differ, both Hanuman and Athena share some overlapping duties.  Both are associated with protection, strength, and the ability to overcome obstacles, often acting as powerful allies to those they serve.  However, their specific roles and powers are unique to their respective pantheons.  They are not direct equivalents, but there are some thematic similarities in their functions.

Answer: {true}
"
2144,Is a jellyfish safe from atherosclerosis?,"Atherosclerosis is a disease that affects the arteries. It involves the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls, leading to plaque formation and narrowing of the arteries.  This process restricts blood flow, potentially leading to heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular problems.

Jellyfish are invertebrates without a circulatory system like humans and other animals susceptible to atherosclerosis.  They do not have arteries, or the equivalent, to develop plaques in.  Therefore, they are not susceptible to atherosclerosis.

Answer: {true}
"
2145,Would Temujin hypothetically be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests?,"Temujin, later known as Genghis Khan, was a highly successful conqueror who built the vast Mongol Empire.  Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, also created a significant empire in Europe.  Both were known for their military prowess and expansionist policies.  It's reasonable to assume that a ruler as ambitious and driven as Genghis Khan would be aware of and potentially envious of the scale and impact of Charlemagne's conquests, even if separated by time and geography.  The competitive nature of rulers often leads to comparisons and a desire to surpass others' achievements.

Answer: {true}
"
2146,Does Antarctica have a lot of problems relating to homelessness?,"Antarctica has no permanent human residents.  All people present are there temporarily for research, tourism, or other specific purposes. Homelessness, by definition, requires a permanent place of residence that a person is without.  Therefore, the concept of homelessness doesn't apply to Antarctica.

Answer: {false}
"
2147,Can Immersion Baptism lead to a death like Jeff Buckley's?,"Jeff Buckley's death was caused by accidental drowning.  While immersion baptism involves submersion in water, it is a controlled and supervised event.  The circumstances surrounding Buckley's death—specifically, the unexpected and uncontrolled nature of his entry into the water—differ significantly from the carefully managed procedure of a religious baptism. Therefore, while both involve submersion in water, the risk of death is vastly different.  Immersion baptism, when properly conducted, does not pose a significant risk of death like that experienced by Jeff Buckley.

Answer: {false}
"
2148,Are raw carrots better for maximizing vitamin A intake?,"Carrots contain beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin A.  However, the body is more efficient at absorbing vitamin A when it's already in its pre-formed vitamin A (retinol) state, rather than converting it from beta-carotene.  While raw carrots do contain beta-carotene, cooking carrots can actually increase the bioavailability of beta-carotene, making it easier for the body to absorb and convert to vitamin A.  Therefore, raw carrots are not necessarily better for maximizing vitamin A intake.  Other foods naturally containing pre-formed vitamin A (like liver) would be a more efficient source.

Answer: {false}
"
2149,Could someone have arrived at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius?,"The Toyota Prius was first introduced to the market in 1997. Wrestlemania X took place in 1994.  Therefore, it would not have been possible to arrive at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius.

"
2150,Would Emmanuel Macron celebrate Cinco de Mayo?,"Emmanuel Macron is the President of France.  Cinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday celebrating the Mexican army's victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. While Macron might be aware of Cinco de Mayo as a significant historical event and a cultural celebration in Mexico, it's unlikely he would personally celebrate it as a national French holiday.  His participation, if any, would likely be limited to diplomatic or formal acknowledgements, not a personal celebration.

Answer: {false}
"
2151,Do sand cats avoid eating all of the prey of eels?,"Sand cats are small desert-dwelling cats that primarily eat small rodents and insects.  Eels are aquatic animals and are not part of a sand cat's natural diet.  Therefore, it is safe to say that sand cats avoid eating all of the prey of eels because their diets don't overlap.

Answer: {true}

2152,Is Drew Carey important to the history of wrestling?,"Drew Carey's involvement with professional wrestling is primarily associated with his hosting of the WWE's ""The Price Is Right"" style show, ""The Price Is Right"" but he did not have a significant impact on the sport's history, rules, or major storylines.  His connection is more related to entertainment surrounding wrestling than to the wrestling itself.

Answer: {false}
"
2153,Are fossil fuels reducing jobs in the Gulf of Mexico?,"The oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico is a major employer.  However, the transition towards renewable energy sources and increasing automation within the fossil fuel industry itself are leading to job losses in some sectors.  While some new jobs may be created in related fields, the overall effect of the decline in fossil fuel reliance is likely a net reduction in employment opportunities in the region.

Answer: {true}
"
2154,Would Roman Gallic Wars army struggle to build the pyramids faster?,"The Roman army during the Gallic Wars was highly organized and skilled in engineering and construction, as evidenced by their road building and fortification projects.  However, their expertise was in military infrastructure, not necessarily large-scale monument building like the pyramids. The pyramid construction techniques involved massive amounts of manpower, specialized tools, and intricate logistical planning that likely differed significantly from Roman military engineering practices. While the Romans were capable builders, it's unlikely they could have built the pyramids faster than the Egyptians who developed and perfected the necessary techniques over centuries.  Their specialized skill sets are simply not directly comparable in this context.

Answer: {true}

"
2157,Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?,"A Bunco game typically requires at least three players, although more is common.  A felony jury in the United States has 12 members.  Since 12 is greater than 3, a felony jury has enough people for a Bunco game.

Answer: {true}
"
2158,Could the Eiffel Tower be completely submerged at the Arctic Ocean's deepest point?,"The Eiffel Tower's height is approximately 330 meters (1,083 feet).  The Arctic Ocean's deepest point is the Molloy Hole, with a depth of approximately 5,600 meters (18,373 feet).  Since the deepest point of the Arctic Ocean is significantly deeper than the height of the Eiffel Tower, the Eiffel Tower could be completely submerged.

2161,Was Moliere Queen Margot's ill fated lover?,"Molière was a famous playwright, and Marguerite de Valois (Queen Margot) was a historical figure.  However, there's no historical evidence suggesting a romantic relationship, let alone an ""ill-fated"" one, between them.  Their lives overlapped in time, but their circles were different.  Molière was a playwright in Paris, while Marguerite de Valois was a queen involved in the complex politics of the French court.

Answer: {false}

2162,"For Hostas to look their best, do they need lots of chlorophyll?","Chlorophyll is the pigment that gives plants their green color and is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.  Hostas are known for their vibrant green foliage, and the intensity of their color is directly related to the amount of chlorophyll they produce.  Therefore, for Hostas to look their best, meaning to have a healthy, vibrant green color, they need a sufficient amount of chlorophyll.

Answer: {true}
"
2163,Would Rime of the Ancient Mariner make a good sonnet?,"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a long narrative poem, far exceeding the length and structure of a sonnet.  A sonnet is a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme and meter (typically iambic pentameter).  The Mariner's tale is far too expansive to be condensed into a sonnet while retaining its essence and impact.  Therefore, it would not make a good sonnet.

Answer: {false}
"
2164,Is an astronomer interested in drosophila?,"Astronomers study celestial objects and phenomena in the universe.  Drosophila, on the other hand, are fruit flies, a common subject of study in genetics and biology. There's no inherent connection between the study of stars and galaxies and the study of fruit flies.  Therefore, an astronomer would not typically be interested in drosophila unless they had a personal interest unrelated to their professional work.

Answer: {false}
"
2165,Could you buy Hershey's Kisses in red foil with farthings after 1960?,"Hershey's Kisses in red foil were introduced in 1962.  Farthings ceased to be legal tender in the United Kingdom in 1960.  Therefore, it would not have been possible to purchase Hershey's Kisses in red foil with farthings after 1960, even if farthings were accepted as currency in the US (which they were not).

"
2167,Is dopamine snorted nasally by drug users?,"Answer: Cocaine is a drug that contains dopamine.  Cocaine is often snorted nasally. Therefore, while dopamine itself isn't typically snorted (it's a neurotransmitter, not a drug in its pure form), it is ingested nasally when cocaine is snorted.

Answer: {true}
"
2168,Is it common for women to have moustaches?,"Explanation: While some women may have naturally occurring facial hair, including moustaches, it is not common.  The amount and visibility of facial hair varies greatly depending on genetics, hormones, and ethnicity.  While some women choose to embrace facial hair, many others opt for hair removal methods like waxing, threading, or laser treatments.  Therefore, having a moustache is not a typical characteristic for women.

Answer: {false}
"
2169,Did Demi Lovato's ancestors help turn maize into popcorn?,"Answer: {false}

Explanation: There's no evidence linking Demi Lovato's ancestry to the development of popcorn.  While maize (corn) has a long history and was cultivated by various indigenous groups in the Americas, connecting this specifically to Demi Lovato's ancestors requires genealogical evidence that's currently unavailable and unlikely to be found.  The development of popcorn as a distinct variety of maize was a gradual process spanning centuries and involved multiple cultures.  The question implies a direct and verifiable connection that is improbable.
"
2170,Does Long John Silver's serve sea otter?,"Long John Silver's is a fast-food restaurant chain specializing in seafood.  Sea otters are marine mammals, and while they are sometimes hunted in certain regions for their fur (though heavily regulated and often illegal), they are not typically considered a food source for human consumption in the vast majority of cultures and certainly not a common menu item at a restaurant chain like Long John Silver's.  Their menu consists of more commonly consumed seafood such as fish and shrimp.

"
2177,Does Neville Longbottom have more courage as a child than as an adult?,"Neville Longbottom's character arc in the Harry Potter series shows a significant growth in courage.  As a child, his courage is present but often overshadowed by his nervousness and self-doubt. He shows bravery in moments like standing up to his bullies and facing his fears, but these acts are often fueled by desperation or external pressures.  As an adult, Neville demonstrates consistent, unwavering courage, leading the rebellion against Voldemort at Hogwarts and becoming a respected Auror.  His adult courage is a mature, developed, and reliable trait, whereas his childhood courage is more sporadic and reactive. Therefore, he demonstrates significantly *more* courage as an adult than as a child.

Answer: {false}
"
2178,Would a model be appropriate to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake?,"A model's primary skill is posing and presenting visually appealing imagery.  While some models may have acting experience, it's not a requirement of their profession.  The lead role in a remake of *La Femme Nikita* demands strong acting ability, intense emotional range, and the capacity to convincingly portray a highly skilled assassin.  While a model *could* potentially have these skills, it's not likely, and casting solely based on being a model would be a high risk.  A more suitable choice would be an actor or actress with a proven track record in action roles and dramatic performances.

"
2181,Could the first European visitor to Guam been friends with Queen Victoria?,"The first European to visit Guam was Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. Queen Victoria reigned from 1837 to 1901.  Since Magellan died in 1521 and Queen Victoria wasn't born until 1819, it's impossible for them to have been friends.

Answer: {false}
"
2182,Can an American black bear swallow a sun bear whole?,"Explanation:
American black bears are significantly larger than sun bears.  While an American black bear's diet is varied and includes meat, swallowing another bear whole is highly unlikely due to the size difference and the physical constraints of their jaws and digestive systems.  The size disparity makes this scenario improbable.


Answer: {false}
"
2183,Would the average American family find Adam Sandler's home to be too small?,"Adam Sandler's home is reported to be quite large and luxurious, far exceeding the size of the average American home.  The average American home size is significantly smaller than what would be considered a mansion. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that the average American family would consider Adam Sandler's home too small.

Answer: {false}
"
2184,Would many meals heavy in brussels sprouts benefit someone on Coumadin?,"Brussels sprouts contain vitamin K, which plays a crucial role in blood clotting. Coumadin (warfarin) is an anticoagulant medication that works by reducing the body's ability to clot blood.  Consuming large amounts of vitamin K can counteract the effects of Coumadin, potentially leading to dangerous blood clots. Therefore, a diet consistently heavy in brussels sprouts would likely be detrimental to someone taking Coumadin, as it would create unpredictable fluctuations in their blood clotting levels.  This requires careful monitoring and possibly dose adjustments of the medication.

Answer: {false}
"
2185,Is the Holy Land important to Eastern religions?,"The Holy Land, encompassing areas in modern-day Israel and Palestine, holds immense religious significance for several Eastern religions.  Judaism considers Jerusalem and other sites within the Holy Land to be central to its history and faith, including sites related to the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Hebrew Bible.  Christianity also regards the Holy Land as incredibly important, as the birthplace, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are all located within its boundaries.  While not as explicitly focused on the region as Judaism and Christianity, some branches of Islam consider Jerusalem a holy city, with significant sites like the Dome of the Rock located there. Therefore, the Holy Land's importance to Eastern religions is undeniable.

Answer: {true}
"
2186,Does the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom have poor job security?,"The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom does not have a fixed term in office.  They can be removed from office through a vote of no confidence by their own party, or by a general election.  While a Prime Minister can serve for a considerable length of time, they are always subject to these potential removal mechanisms.  Therefore, their job security is considered relatively poor compared to many other political leaders with fixed terms.

Answer: {true}
"
2187,Could all People's Volunteer Army hypothetically be transported on Symphony of the Seas?,"The People's Volunteer Army (PVA) was a large military force during the Korean War.  Estimates for its size vary, but even conservative estimates place it in the hundreds of thousands of soldiers.  The Symphony of the Seas is a large cruise ship, but its passenger capacity is far less than the number of soldiers who served in the PVA.  Even if we only consider the number of personnel who could simultaneously fit on board, the ship could not accommodate anywhere near the total number of PVA soldiers.


Answer: {false}
"
2188,Can professional boxers expect to have low dental bills?,"Professional boxers are frequently involved in high-impact contact that can result in significant dental injuries, such as chipped, broken, or knocked-out teeth.  The treatment of such injuries is expensive, involving restorative procedures like crowns, implants, or dentures.  Therefore, it is unlikely that professional boxers would have low dental bills.

2189,Could the leader of Heaven's Gate save images in JPEG format?,"The Heaven's Gate group's mass suicide occurred in 1997.  JPEG image format was already widely used and available by 1997.  Therefore, it's highly likely they could have saved images in JPEG format.

Answer: {true}
"
2190,Has type of political association Pompey had with Caesar influenced reality TV?,"Explanation:
The question asks whether Pompey's political association with Caesar influenced reality TV.  There's no direct causal link between the political relationship of Pompey and Caesar (a historical event from ancient Rome) and the creation of reality television (a modern entertainment format). Reality TV's development is rooted in various factors including technological advancements, evolving entertainment preferences, and the rise of specific television production techniques.  Pompey and Caesar's political rivalry, while historically significant, has no demonstrable impact on the genres, formats, or themes of modern reality television.

Answer: {false}
"
2191,Are the knights in the Medieval Times show not authentic knights?,"The Medieval Times show is a dinner theater production featuring staged jousting and other forms of entertainment.

They are not trained in actual medieval combat techniques and the events are choreographed for entertainment.

Answer: {true}
"
2192,Did the 23rd amendment give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president?,"The 23rd Amendment to the United States Constitution grants Washington D.C. electors in the Electoral College.  It does *not* grant voting rights to Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but are not a state and therefore do not have voting rights in presidential elections.

Answer: {false}
"
2194,Would Bruce Gandy be an odd choice for Messiah (Handel)?,"The question asks if Bruce Gandy would be an odd choice for the role of Messiah in Handel's oratorio.  Handel's Messiah is a classical vocal work requiring a highly trained singer capable of performing demanding arias and choral sections.  There is no publicly known individual named Bruce Gandy who is a renowned classical singer with the requisite vocal skills for such a role.  Therefore, choosing someone without that established musical background would be unusual and likely a poor casting decision.

Answer: {true}
"
2195,Does Amtrak run from NYC directly to the Moai location?,"Amtrak is a passenger rail service operating within the United States.  The Moai statues are located on Easter Island, a remote island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, far outside the reach of Amtrak's rail network.  Therefore, Amtrak does not offer a direct route from New York City to Easter Island.

Answer: {false}
"
2196,Could someone in a coma experience fear?,"Fear is a complex emotional response involving conscious processing of perceived threats and physiological changes like increased heart rate and adrenaline release.  A person in a coma is largely unresponsive and lacks conscious awareness. While some brain activity may still occur, the level of processing required to experience fear is generally absent in a coma.  While the body might react physiologically to stimuli,  a true experience of *fear*, which requires cognitive appraisal and emotional interpretation, is highly unlikely in a coma state.

Answer: {false}
"
2197,Does Andrew Johnson's presidential number exceed Elagabalus's Emperor number?,"Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States. Elagabalus was the Roman Emperor number 22.  Therefore, Andrew Johnson's presidential number (17) is less than Elagabalus's emperor number (22).

Answer: {false}
"
2198,Can Lamborghini's fastest model win a race against a Porsche 911?,"To determine whether Lamborghini's fastest model could win a race against a Porsche 911, we need to compare the performance specifications of the fastest models from each manufacturer.  This includes factors like horsepower, torque, 0-60 mph time, top speed, and handling.  While a specific outcome depends on many variables (track conditions, driver skill, etc.), a general comparison of top-end specs can give a reasonable indication of which car is likely to be faster.  Lamborghini and Porsche both produce extremely high-performance vehicles, and the specific fastest models at any given time can vary. Therefore, a definitive answer without specifying exact models is difficult.  However,  Porsche's 911 line is known for its overall performance balance and often boasts impressive lap times, making it a strong competitor.  Lamborghini is generally known for higher top speeds and more aggressive power delivery.  The actual race result would depend on the specific models involved and other factors.

Answer: {It depends on the specific Lamborghini and Porsche 911 models being compared and race conditions.}
"
2199,Are fresh garlic cloves as easy to eat as roasted garlic cloves?,"Roasted garlic cloves have a softer, sweeter, and less pungent flavor than raw garlic cloves.  The roasting process reduces the harshness of the raw garlic, making it more palatable for many people.  Raw garlic cloves, on the other hand, have a strong, sharp, and sometimes overpowering flavor that can be unpleasant for some to eat raw. Therefore, roasted garlic cloves are generally considered easier to eat than fresh garlic cloves.

Answer: {false}
"
2200,Do most college students own a fax machine?,"The vast majority of college students today do not own fax machines.

2202,Did the Qwerty keyboard layout predate computers?,"The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed for mechanical typewriters, which significantly predate computers.  The layout, while arguably suboptimal for modern typing, was intended to address mechanical limitations of early typewriters to prevent key jams. Therefore, the QWERTY layout existed long before computers were invented.

Answer: {true}
"
2203,Do any Islamic dominated countries have a Starbucks?,"Starbucks' global presence is extensive, encompassing numerous countries with diverse religious and cultural landscapes.  While the precise number of Starbucks locations in each country isn't consistently published in readily accessible, comprehensive lists, it is a matter of public knowledge that Starbucks operates in many countries with significant Muslim populations.  Therefore, it's highly likely that at least one Islamic-dominated country hosts Starbucks locations.  To definitively state otherwise would require exhaustive, up-to-the-minute data on every Starbucks worldwide, which is not readily available.

Answer: {true}
"
2204,Is it normal to blow out candles during a funeral?,"Answer: Blowing out candles is not a typical part of funeral traditions in most cultures.  Candles are often used in memorial services, sometimes representing the life of the deceased, but the act of blowing them out would be considered unusual and inappropriate by most people.  The symbolism associated with candles at a funeral is usually one of remembrance and light, not something to be actively extinguished.

Answer: {false}
"
2205,Was Eve involved in an incestuous relationship?,"Answer: Eve was the first woman, according to the Book of Genesis.  She had no siblings or parents before she was created.  Therefore, she could not have been involved in an incestuous relationship.

"
2206,Do placozoa get learning disabilities?,"Placozoa are simple multicellular animals with a very basic nervous system.  They lack a brain or any complex central nervous system, which are structures associated with learning and cognitive abilities. Learning disabilities, as we understand them, require a certain level of neurological complexity to manifest.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that Placozoa, with their extremely rudimentary organization, could experience learning disabilities.

Answer: {false}
"
2207,Are System of a Down opposed to globalization?,"System of a Down's lyrics frequently express criticism of war, imperialism, and government corruption.  Globalization is often associated with these negative aspects, as it can lead to exploitation, economic inequality, and the erosion of national sovereignty. While the band doesn't explicitly state ""we are opposed to globalization,"" their consistent messaging aligns with critiques of the negative consequences often associated with globalization. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer their opposition to the detrimental aspects of globalization, even if they don't use the term directly.

Answer: {true}
"
2208,Was Dr. Seuss a liar?,"Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, was a prolific children's author known for his whimsical stories and illustrations.  While his books are beloved for their creativity and fantastical elements, there's no evidence suggesting he was a liar in the conventional sense of deliberately telling falsehoods.  His works are fictional narratives, and it's inaccurate to judge their factual accuracy. While some of his earlier works contain elements that could be considered culturally insensitive by modern standards, this doesn't equate to him being a liar.


Answer: {false}
"
2209,Is it normally unnecessary to wear a coat in Hollywood in July?,"Hollywood, California, has a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  July falls squarely within the summer months, meaning temperatures are generally high and a coat would likely be unnecessary for most people.

"
2210,Will silicon wedding rings outsell bromine wedding rings?,"Silicon is a common, relatively inexpensive material used in many applications, including some jewelry.  Bromine, on the other hand, is a highly reactive and toxic halogen.  It would be extremely dangerous and impractical to use bromine to make wedding rings. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that bromine wedding rings would even exist, let alone outsell silicon wedding rings.

Answer: {true}
"
2211,Would Saddam Hussein hypothetically choose Saladin as ally over Idris I?,"Answer: Saddam Hussein was a Ba'athist, and Ba'athism is a secular Arab nationalist ideology.  Saladin was a major figure in the resurgence of Islam and a renowned military leader who recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders. Idris I, on the other hand, was a significant figure in the early history of Morocco and the founder of the Idrisid dynasty, and is revered in Moroccan history. While both were Muslim, their historical contexts and the nature of their accomplishments differ significantly.  Given Saddam Hussein's secular Arab nationalism, it's more likely he would align himself with Saladin, a powerful Arab military leader, than Idris I, a figure from a different historical and geographical context whose importance is primarily within Moroccan history.  While both were Muslims, the pan-Arab ideology of Ba'athism would likely prioritize a figure like Saladin.

Answer: {true}
"
2212,Is March named after Jupiter's son in Roman mythology?,"March is named after Mars, the Roman god of war.  While Jupiter is the king of the gods in Roman mythology, March is not named after his son.

Answer: {false}
"
2213,Was Subway involved in a pedophilia scandal?,"Subway restaurants have faced several lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct and child abuse by franchise owners or employees, not the corporation itself.  These cases involved individual franchisees' actions, not company-wide policies or involvement. While Subway is not directly implicated in a single, overarching pedophilia scandal, the numerous lawsuits alleging such actions by individuals associated with the franchise create a situation where the question becomes complex and potentially misleading.  The lack of direct company involvement doesn't negate the serious allegations and harm caused.

Answer: {true}
"
2214,Is the current Chief Justice of the United States forbidden from buying alcohol?,"The current Chief Justice of the United States is John Roberts.

Answer: {false}
"
2216,Would Iris (mythology) and Hermes hypothetically struggle at a UPS job?,"Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, is associated with swift movement and messages.  However, her abilities are supernatural, not applicable to the physical demands of a UPS job.  Hermes, the Greek messenger god, is known for his speed and efficiency, but again, his powers are divine and wouldn't translate directly to real-world logistics.  Both would likely struggle with the physical labor, repetitive tasks, and strict adherence to schedules required of a UPS employee.  Their divine abilities wouldn't be helpful in this context.


Answer: {true}
"
2217,Was Dorothea Wendling from same place Porsche originated?,"Dorothea Wendling was a German actress.  Porsche automobiles originated in Stuttgart, Germany.  Therefore, it's highly probable Dorothea Wendling was from the same country as the origin of Porsche, Germany.

Answer: {false}
"
2219,Would Tom Cruise ever insult L. Ron Hubbard?,"Tom Cruise is a devout Scientologist, and L. Ron Hubbard is the founder of Scientology.  It's highly improbable that Cruise would publicly insult Hubbard, given Hubbard's central role in the religion and Cruise's deep commitment to it.  Insulting Hubbard would be considered highly disrespectful within the Scientology community.

2220,Does Felix Potvin have a position on a dodgeball team?,"There is no publicly available information indicating Felix Potvin's involvement in dodgeball.  While he is a known former NHL goaltender, there's nothing to suggest he participates in or holds a position on a dodgeball team.

Answer: {false}
"
2221,Is the Gujarati script the same category of script as Kanji?,"Gujarati is an abugida, a type of alphabet where consonants are written with inherent vowels, and vowels are indicated by diacritics.  Kanji, on the other hand, is a logographic script, meaning each character represents a word or morpheme, rather than a sound. While both are writing systems used for different languages, they fundamentally differ in their structure and how they represent language.  Therefore, they are not in the same category of script.

Answer: {false}
"
2222,Do any video games about the end of civilization have slot machines?,"Many post-apocalyptic video games incorporate elements of survival, scavenging, and resource management.  Slot machines, as a symbol of pre-apocalypse consumerism and potentially a source of rare resources or currency in a broken world, could realistically be included in such a game's setting. However, it's not a universal feature.  Some games might focus on other aspects of survival and eschew such elements. Therefore, while it's *possible*, it's not guaranteed.


Answer: {false}
"
2223,Do you find glutamic acid in a severed finger?,"Glutamic acid is a non-essential amino acid, meaning the human body can produce it.

2225,Did President William Howard Taft read DC Comics?,"William Howard Taft's presidency ended in 1913. DC Comics, as we know it, did not begin publishing until 1934.  Therefore, it would have been impossible for him to have read DC Comics.

Answer: {false}
"
2226,Do Muslims have a different idea of Seraphim than Christians?,"The concept of Seraphim differs significantly between Christian and Islamic theological traditions, despite both religions sharing Abrahamic roots.  In Christianity, Seraphim are typically described as the highest order of angels, residing closest to God and characterized by their burning holiness and six wings.  They are often depicted in art and literature.

Islam, on the other hand, doesn't have a direct equivalent to Christian Seraphim. Islamic angelology features a hierarchy of angels with specific roles and names,  but there's no distinct angel group specifically called ""Seraphim"" with comparable characteristics. While Islamic tradition recognizes numerous angels with immense power and proximity to God, their descriptions and roles don't perfectly align with the Christian understanding of Seraphim.  The focus in Islam is often more on the names and roles of angels like Jibril (Gabriel) and Mikail (Michael), rather than hierarchical classifications mirroring Christian angelology.  Therefore, while both traditions believe in angels, their specific conceptions of these celestial beings, including their classification and attributes, differ substantially.

Answer: {true}
"
2227,Would you hire someone with dyscalculia to do surveying work?,"Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to understand numbers and mathematical concepts.  Surveying work heavily relies on accurate calculations, measurements, and spatial reasoning, all of which are significantly impacted by dyscalculia.  While someone with dyscalculia might be able to perform certain aspects of surveying work with appropriate accommodations, the core mathematical demands of the profession would likely make them unsuitable for the role without significant support, which might not be feasible or cost-effective for a surveying company.  Therefore, hiring someone with dyscalculia for surveying work without substantial accommodations would likely lead to inaccuracies and potential safety hazards.

2230,"If your skin was turning the color of a zombie, could it be because of nickel?","Nickel is a known allergen, and one of the reactions to nickel allergy can be a skin rash that may appear discolored or even slightly greenish, depending on the severity.  While a nickel allergy wouldn't make your skin look exactly like a zombie (which is a fictional representation), the discoloration could, in some extreme cases, lead to a significant change in skin tone.  The color change would not be solely due to the presence of nickel, but rather to the body's inflammatory response to it.

Answer: {true}
"
2231,Could a single bitcoin ever cover cost of a Volkswagen Jetta?,"The price of a Volkswagen Jetta varies depending on the model year, features, and location.  However, a reasonable estimate for a used Jetta might be between $15,000 and $25,000 USD.

The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and fluctuates constantly.  There have been periods where the price of Bitcoin was far below $15,000, and periods where it was far above.  Therefore, it is entirely possible that in the past, a single Bitcoin was worth less than the cost of a Jetta. It's also possible that in the future, a single Bitcoin could be worth far more.  Currently, however, a single Bitcoin's value often exceeds the cost of a Jetta.


Answer: {true}
"
2232,Does Fraktur have a sordid history?,"Fraktur, a Blackletter typeface, was widely used in German-speaking regions for centuries.  While not inherently ""sordid"" in its design, its association with Nazi Germany during the Holocaust gives it a highly problematic and controversial history.  The Nazis adopted Fraktur for official documents and propaganda, further associating it with their regime of oppression and genocide. Although the typeface predates Nazism, and its use wasn't invented or created by the Nazi party, the strong association with this dark period in history taints its image and makes it a highly sensitive choice in modern usage.  Thus, while the typeface itself is not inherently evil, its historical context and association with the Nazi regime lends a strong element of negative connotation.

Answer: {true}
"
2233,Was Martin Luther same sect as Martin Luther King Jr.?,"Martin Luther was a 16th-century German theologian who initiated the Protestant Reformation.  Martin Luther King Jr. was a 20th-century American Baptist minister and civil rights activist.  While both men were Christians, they belonged to entirely different denominations and theological traditions. Martin Luther was a founder of Protestantism, while Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist, a denomination that emerged much later within the Protestant tradition but with significant differences in theological emphasis and practice.  Therefore, they were not the same sect.

2236,Will someone die without white blood cells?,"White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are crucial components of the immune system.  They are responsible for defending the body against infection and disease.  Without white blood cells, the body would be extremely vulnerable to pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) and would be unable to mount an effective immune response.  This would lead to overwhelming and potentially fatal infections.

2238,Can Simon Cowell vote for the next Supreme Court judge?,"Explanation:
The power to appoint Supreme Court justices lies with the President of the United States, and those appointments must be confirmed by the Senate.  Simon Cowell is a British television personality and music executive. He is not a citizen of the United States, nor is he an elected official. Therefore, he does not have a vote in the selection of Supreme Court justices.

"
2239,Can Michael Bloomberg fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade?,"Explanation:

To determine if Michael Bloomberg could fund Micronesia's debt for a decade, we need to consider the following:

1. **Micronesia's debt:** We need the approximate total debt of Micronesia.  This information isn't readily available in a single, easily accessible source and can fluctuate.  We'd need to research official government financial reports.

2. **Michael Bloomberg's net worth:**  Michael Bloomberg's net worth is substantial and publicly reported, though it fluctuates.  We would need a current estimate.

3. **Annual debt servicing:** Micronesia's annual debt servicing costs (interest payments and principal repayments) would need to be determined from its financial statements.

4. **Ten-year cost:**  The ten-year cost would be the annual debt servicing cost multiplied by ten.

Only by obtaining the precise figures for Micronesia's debt and Bloomberg's net worth and calculating the ten-year cost of servicing Micronesia's debt can we accurately determine if Bloomberg could fund it.  Without these figures, it is impossible to provide a definitive yes or no answer.

"
2241,Could a cat ride Panzer VIII Maus tank missile from Barcelona to Madrid?,"Explanation:
The Panzer VIII Maus was a German super-heavy tank during World War II.  It was never mass-produced and only two prototypes were built.  Its sheer size and weight (188 tons) make it impractical for travel, let alone between two major cities like Barcelona and Madrid.  The tank would be unable to navigate roads, bridges, or terrain.  Even if it could, it would be highly illegal to operate such a vehicle on public roads, and it would require immense logistical support and would likely be impounded immediately if detected.   Moreover, the Maus did not have any missile systems; it was armed with a 128mm main gun and a 7.92mm machine gun.  Therefore, a cat riding on a Maus tank from Barcelona to Madrid is impossible.

2242,Are Aldi's foods discounted due to being out of date?,"Aldi is known for its business model of offering low prices on groceries.  This is achieved through various strategies, including efficient supply chains, private label brands, and limited store sizes. While some products might be nearing their expiration dates and thus discounted, this is not the primary reason for Aldi's low prices.  Aldi actively manages its inventory to minimize waste, but the overall low pricing strategy is not primarily based on discounting soon-to-expire goods.

2245,Is it impossible to tell if someone is having a stroke?,"Strokes have a range of symptoms, and some strokes are subtle or have symptoms easily mistaken for other conditions.  However, there are known signs and symptoms of a stroke (such as sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, vision problems), and medical professionals have tests to diagnose them. Therefore, while not every stroke is immediately obvious, it's not impossible to tell if someone is having one.  Medical attention can help confirm a diagnosis.

2246,Can you taste Law & Order?,"The question ""Can you taste Law & Order?"" is a figurative question, not a literal one.  It plays on the idea of the show's repetitive formula and predictable plot lines.  The question implies whether the show is so formulaic that it lacks flavor or originality, making it ""tasteless"" in a metaphorical sense.  There's no literal tasting involved.

2249,Should you wrap a gift for a mother of a stillborn in stork wrapping paper?,"The loss of a stillborn child is incredibly painful and sensitive.  Stork wrapping paper is typically associated with the celebration of a new baby's birth. Using this type of wrapping paper would be insensitive and inappropriate for a gift given to a mother grieving the loss of her child.  A more thoughtful and appropriate choice would be something more neutral or somber.

2251,Would Immanuel Kant be disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement?,"Immanuel Kant's philosophy emphasized universal moral principles based on reason and rationality.  He strongly believed in the inherent dignity and worth of every rational being. While he didn't address the specific context of the Black Lives Matter movement directly, his emphasis on treating all individuals with respect, regardless of race or any other arbitrary characteristic, suggests he would likely oppose any form of systemic racism or discrimination. The Black Lives Matter movement fundamentally advocates for equal rights and an end to racial injustice.  Therefore, Kant's commitment to universal moral principles and the inherent dignity of all persons aligns with the movement's core values.  It is unlikely he would approve of the violence sometimes associated with protests, but his core philosophical stance would likely be supportive of the movement's overall goal of racial equality.

Answer: {false}
"
2252,Are pancakes a bad snack for cats?,"Pancakes are generally not a good snack for cats.  They often contain ingredients that are toxic to cats, such as xylitol (an artificial sweetener), chocolate (if present), and high amounts of sugar and fats.  These ingredients can lead to digestive upset, pancreatitis, and other health problems.  Cats require a diet specifically formulated for their nutritional needs, and pancakes are not part of that healthy diet.

While both have sharp teeth for tearing meat, the exact shapes and sizes of their teeth would differ.  Their jaw structures and muscle arrangements would also vary, leading to differences in bite force and chewing mechanics.  Therefore, their dentures would be different.

2256,Have any members of the 2020 British royal family allegedly committed a felony?,"Answer:  The question asks whether any member of the British Royal Family in 2020 has been *allegedly* accused of a felony.  While there have been various scandals and controversies involving members of the Royal Family over the years,  it requires establishing whether any of these rose to the level of a felony *allegation* in 2020.  Publicly available information doesn't immediately reveal such a case.  While accusations or controversies may exist, proving a formal felony allegation requires evidence of a criminal charge filed and not simply negative press.  Therefore, without definitive proof of a formal felony allegation against a member of the Royal Family in 2020, a definitive ""yes"" is not possible.

2259,Could Robert Wadlow hypothetically see Frankenstein's monster's bald spot from above?,"Robert Wadlow was the tallest man ever recorded, reaching a height of 8 feet 11 inches (2.72 meters).  Frankenstein's monster, as depicted in various adaptations, is typically portrayed as very tall but not exceptionally so, often around 8 feet or less.  Assuming a scenario where both are standing, Robert Wadlow's superior height would allow him to see over Frankenstein's monster's head, including any bald spot on top.

Answer: {true}
"
2260,Would a kindergarten teacher make a lesson of the New Testament?,"A kindergarten teacher's curriculum would likely focus on age-appropriate subjects such as basic literacy, numeracy, and social skills. While some kindergartens might incorporate stories from various religious traditions in a way that respects diverse backgrounds, a full lesson dedicated to the New Testament would likely be inappropriate due to its complexity and potentially sensitive content for young children.  The depth of understanding and maturity needed to engage meaningfully with the New Testament's themes and narratives is generally not present at the kindergarten level.  Therefore, a focused lesson on the New Testament would be unusual and unlikely.

2262,Does taking ukemi halt kinetic energy?,"Ukemi, the Japanese term for breakfalls, is a technique used in martial arts to safely absorb and redirect the force of a fall or throw.  While it doesn't completely halt kinetic energy (energy of motion), it significantly reduces the impact on the body by spreading the force over a larger area and extending the time over which the force is absorbed.  This reduces the potential for injury.  The kinetic energy isn't destroyed; it's transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat and sound, through the deformation of muscles and the impact with the ground. However, a significant portion of the initial kinetic energy is dissipated, preventing it from causing severe damage to the body.

Answer: {false}
"
2263,"Should children be kept from ""special brownies""?","Explanation: ""Special brownies"" are brownies containing cannabis, a drug that is illegal in many places and poses risks to developing brains and bodies.

Their immature bodies are especially vulnerable to the effects of the drug. The consumption of cannabis by children is unethical and potentially harmful.

2264,Will Futurama surpass the number of episodes of The Simpsons by the end of 2020?,"Explanation:
To determine if Futurama could surpass The Simpsons in episode count by the end of 2020, we need to know the episode counts of both shows and whether Futurama had any new seasons planned for release in 2020.  While The Simpsons had a very large number of episodes by 2020, Futurama's production history was more sporadic, with cancellations and revivals.  Therefore, we need to research the exact number of episodes of each show by the end of 2020 to provide an accurate answer.  This requires external information beyond the knowledge I currently have.

2266,Does being good at guitar hero make you a good guitarist?,"Answer: Guitar Hero is a video game that simulates playing the guitar.  While it may improve hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and rhythm, it doesn't translate directly to the skills needed to play a real guitar.  Real guitar playing requires knowledge of musical theory, chords, scales, finger dexterity, and other technical skills that Guitar Hero does not teach.  A person might be excellent at Guitar Hero but lack the fundamental skills to play a real guitar well.

Answer: {false}
"
2267,Did any killer Manson band members were named for exceed Charles Manson's kills?,"The question asks if any members of the Manson Family exceeded Charles Manson's kill count.  Charles Manson himself did not directly kill anyone; he was convicted as a mastermind and accomplice in the murders committed by his followers.  While several members of the Manson Family were convicted of murder in relation to the Tate-LaBianca murders, none of them individually killed more people than the total number attributed to the Manson Family as a whole, and certainly not more than the collective number of victims across all related crimes. Therefore, no single member's kill count surpasses the collective count associated with Charles Manson and his followers.

Answer: {false}
"
2268,Can the US branch of government that has power over the military also have the power to veto?,"The US branch of government with power over the military is the Executive Branch, headed by the President.

2269,Do Christians anticipate an existence in Sheol after death?,"Christian theology generally does not envision Sheol as a place of eternal existence for believers.  Sheol, in the Old Testament, is often understood as a general term for the underworld, a place of the dead.  However, Christian belief centers on the resurrection and eternal life in heaven or a similar state of being with God. While some denominations may interpret certain biblical passages differently, the core Christian belief system moves beyond the concept of Sheol as the ultimate destination for believers.  The common understanding is that Christ's sacrifice and resurrection altered the fate of believers, offering them eternal life in a place separate and superior to the Old Testament understanding of Sheol.

Answer: {false}
"
2270,Were the Great Pyramids built by a theocratic government?,"The Great Pyramids of Giza were built during the Old Kingdom of Egypt (roughly 2686-2181 BCE).  During this period, Egypt was ruled by pharaohs who were considered divine rulers, embodying the power of the gods.  The pharaoh's authority was deeply intertwined with religious beliefs, and the construction of the pyramids was a massive undertaking directly tied to the pharaoh's role as a divine intermediary and their preparation for the afterlife.  The workforce, resources, and organization required for this monumental task were all controlled and directed by the pharaoh and his officials. Therefore, the construction was intrinsically linked to and controlled by a theocratic government.

2271,Can Justin Timberlake ride Shipwreck Falls at Six Flags?,"To answer this question, we need to determine if Justin Timberlake meets the height restriction for Shipwreck Falls at Six Flags.  The height restriction varies slightly depending on the specific Six Flags location, but generally, it's around 48 inches (4 feet).  We do not have information on Justin Timberlake's height.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not he can ride the ride.

"
2274,Can amoebas get cancer?,"Amoebas are single-celled organisms.  Cancer, as we understand it, is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division, typically resulting from mutations in multiple genes within a cell that regulate cell growth and death.  Because amoebas are single-celled, they don't have the complex multicellular organization and systems of cell regulation that are necessary for the development of cancer as it's defined in multicellular organisms. While an amoeba can experience uncontrolled cell division leading to potentially harmful consequences, this isn't considered cancer in the same way as in complex organisms.  There might be analogous processes that lead to uncontrolled growth in amoebas, but it's not the same disease.

Answer: {false}
"
2275,Did U.S. soldiers listen to Justin Bieber's Believe album during the Battle of Baghdad?,"The Battle of Baghdad was a major military engagement that took place in April 2003, as part of the Iraq War.  Justin Bieber's album ""Believe"" was released in June 2012. Therefore, it's highly improbable that U.S. soldiers would have been listening to ""Believe"" during the Battle of Baghdad, as the album didn't exist yet.

Answer: {false}

"
2280,Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?,"The Kingdom of Hungary had a complex political system throughout its history, evolving from early medieval tribal structures to a more centralized monarchy.  While there were periods of influence by landed elites, a direct system where land owners *elected* their rulers in the same way as a modern democracy wasn't consistently in place.  The power of the nobility was significant, influencing the succession and often pushing for their own interests, but this typically took the form of pressure, alliances, and even rebellion rather than a structured electoral process.  The King's authority was paramount, and while the nobility had influence, they didn't hold the power to directly elect the ruler.

Answer: {false}
"
2281,Would Topa Inca Yupanqui have encountered the western honey bee?,"Topa Inca Yupanqui was the Sapa Inca (emperor) of the Inca Empire from 1471 to 1493.  The western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is not native to the Americas.  It was introduced to the Americas by European colonists after 1492.  Therefore, Topa Inca Yupanqui could not have encountered the western honey bee during his lifetime.

Answer: {false}
"
2283,Is a fairy more prevalent in world myths than a valkyrie?,"Fairies appear in a vast range of folklore traditions across the globe, from Europe to Asia and beyond.  Their forms and roles vary, but the presence of small, often magical, human-like beings is a common thread. Valkyries, on the other hand, are specifically part of Norse mythology, associated with Odin and the battlefield. While Valkyries are important figures in their own mythology, their presence is limited compared to the widespread prevalence of fairy-like creatures in mythologies worldwide.

Answer: {true}

A chinchilla cannot be a type of cat.

2286,Does the Boy Who Cried Wolf hypothetically have reason to pray to Pan?,"The story of ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" involves a shepherd boy who repeatedly lies about seeing a wolf, causing the villagers to eventually ignore his genuine cries for help when a wolf actually appears.  Pan is the Greek god of the wild, shepherds, flocks, and rustic music.  Given the boy's profession as a shepherd and the ultimate consequences of his lies relating to the safety of his flock, it could be argued that he has reason to pray to Pan for forgiveness or for better judgment.  He might pray for protection for his sheep, or for a second chance to regain the villagers' trust.

2288,Is it unusual to play Happy hardcore music at a funeral?,"Happy hardcore is a fast-paced, energetic genre of electronic dance music often associated with high energy and excitement.  Funerals, on the other hand, are typically somber and solemn occasions.  The stark contrast between the celebratory nature of happy hardcore and the mournful atmosphere of a funeral makes it highly unusual and inappropriate to play this type of music at such an event.

Answer: {true}
"
2289,Could Sainsbury's buy Tesco?,"To determine if Sainsbury's could buy Tesco, we need to compare their market capitalizations (market value).  Sainsbury's market capitalization is significantly smaller than Tesco's.  A successful takeover would require Sainsbury's to either secure massive external financing (debt or equity) or offer a premium significantly above Tesco's current market valuation, which would be a highly risky and possibly unsuccessful endeavor given the size difference and potential regulatory hurdles.  While theoretically possible, it's highly improbable due to the significant financial challenges involved.
