561,Is Godzilla's image likely grounds for a lawsuit in 2050?,"Answer: Godzilla is a fictional monster, first appearing in the 1954 film ""Godzilla"". Copyright protection generally lasts for a limited time, and for works created by corporations, it can last for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.

Therefore, by 2050, Godzilla's image *might* be in the public domain.  However, even if the original Godzilla is in the public domain, Toho (the company that owns Godzilla) has created numerous iterations of Godzilla over the years, each potentially with its own copyright.

734,Would a baby gray whale fit in a tractor-trailer?,"Answer:
A newborn gray whale calf can measure up to 16 feet long and weigh up to 2,000 pounds. A standard tractor-trailer has an interior length of about 53 feet. So, in terms of length, a baby gray whale could fit in a tractor-trailer. However, the height and width of the trailer are also important.  A typical trailer's interior height is around 110 inches, which is a little over 9 feet. A baby gray whale can have a girth (circumference) of up to 12 feet, meaning a diameter of roughly 4 feet. Given this, fitting the calf inside the trailer, height-wise, is questionable. Finally, trailers also are restricted in weight, even with multiple axles.

738,Can your psychologist say hello to you while you are out at the supermarket?,"It depends on the nature of the relationship and the specific circumstances. If it's a purely professional relationship, it would be considered a boundary crossing, especially if the psychologist initiated the contact outside of a scheduled appointment. If they happen to run into each other by chance, a brief, polite acknowledgment would be acceptable, but extending it beyond a simple ""hello"" would be unprofessional. If they have a pre-existing personal relationship outside of the therapeutic one, then a more casual interaction would be appropriate. However, even in that case, the psychologist should be mindful of maintaining professional boundaries and avoid any behavior that could be perceived as blurring the lines between their professional and personal roles.

Answer: {It's possible, but depends on the nature of their relationship and the specific circumstances. Generally, it's best for a psychologist to maintain professional boundaries.}

All of these are products of a complex society.  A single individual, or even a small group, lacking the infrastructure and collective knowledge of a society could not possibly design and build a jet engine, let alone an entire functioning airplane.  The materials science, the precision machining, the fuel refinement, the navigation systems, the communication technologies—all of these require the combined efforts of many specialized individuals working within a sophisticated societal structure.
{false}
"
1094,Would human race go extinct without chlorophyll?,"Answer: Chlorophyll is the pigment in plants that allows them to absorb energy from sunlight for photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of sugars.  These sugars are the base of the food chain, providing energy for plant growth and reproduction, and also serving as the primary food source for herbivores. Herbivores, in turn, are eaten by carnivores.  Without chlorophyll and photosynthesis, plants could not produce food, leading to the collapse of the entire food chain. This would ultimately lead to the extinction of humans, who depend on plants and animals for sustenance.

1120,Do some people soak in olive oil and water?,"Answer: Olive oil is commonly used as a moisturizer for skin and hair. Soaking in water can be relaxing and hydrating. While some people might add olive oil to a bath, it's not a common practice to ""soak"" in a mixture of olive oil and water, as oil and water don't mix well, and it would likely leave an oily residue.

"
1127,Could Plato have agreed with the beliefs of Jainism?,"Answer:
Plato lived from 428/427 or 424/423 BC to 348/347 BC. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion.  Mahavira, considered the last of the Jain Tirthankaras, is believed to have lived and taught around the same time as Buddha and is seen by Jains as the founder of modern Jainism. It is generally accepted by scholars that Jainism existed before Mahavira. Jainism spread throughout ancient India.  It's unclear how much contact there would have been between Ancient Greece and India during Plato's life.  Alexander the Great's campaigns in India started in 326 BC, after Plato's death. While there was trade and some exchange of ideas between Greece and parts of the East during Plato's time, it would have been limited.  However, it is possible that some rudimentary ideas from Jain philosophy might have made it to Greece. 

Jainism emphasizes nonviolence (ahimsa), a concept that aligns with Plato's emphasis on justice and harmony.  Jainism also focuses on the idea of karma and reincarnation, which has some similarities to Plato's theory of Forms and the immortal soul. Jainism's emphasis on asceticism and detachment from material possessions could also be seen as somewhat compatible with Plato's emphasis on the pursuit of wisdom and the ideal world of Forms.

It is conceivable that had Plato been exposed to Jain ideas, he might have found some common ground, especially with regards to ethical principles and the pursuit of a higher, spiritual reality. However, there are also key differences. Plato's philosophy is heavily focused on reason and logic, while Jainism is more centered on spiritual practices and the attainment of liberation (moksha).

"
1132,Can Spartina Patens thrive in the Sahara Desert?,"Answer: Spartina patens, also known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments like salt marshes.  The Sahara Desert is characterized by aridity, not salinity. In fact, desert soils can become saline due to evaporation, but the primary issue is lack of water. Spartina patens needs a wet, salty environment, not a dry, potentially salty one. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that Spartina patens could thrive in the Sahara Desert.

"

1160,Did Julius Caesar read books on Pharmacology?,"Julius Caesar lived from 100 BCE to 44 BCE. Pharmacology, as a distinct field of study, did not exist during Caesar's lifetime. The term ""pharmacology"" itself is derived from the Greek word ""pharmakon,"" which could mean drug, medicine, poison, or spell. While ancient civilizations had knowledge of medicinal plants and their uses, a systematic study of drugs and their effects on the body did not emerge until much later.  Dioscorides, a Greek physician and pharmacologist, is considered one of the founders of pharmacology. He lived from c. 40 AD to c. 90 AD, well after Caesar's death. Therefore, Caesar could not have read books on pharmacology as we understand it today.

1165,Would Achilles dominate Legolas in a hypothetical fight?,"Answer: Achilles is a demigod in Greek mythology, known for his superhuman strength, speed, and near invulnerability, except for his heel. Legolas is an elf from Lord of the Rings, known for his archery skills, agility, and some degree of enhanced strength and speed compared to humans.  While Legolas is a formidable warrior, Achilles' demigod status grants him a significant advantage. Legolas' arrows, even if they could pierce Achilles' skin (which is debatable given his near invulnerability), would likely not inflict enough damage to overcome him quickly. Achilles' superior strength and speed would likely overwhelm Legolas in close combat.

1167,Did Metallica band members cutting their hair hurt their sales?,"Answer: Metallica cut their hair in the mid-90s, a period that coincided with a decline in mainstream popularity for thrash metal and a rise in alternative rock and grunge. While their album ""Load"" (1996) and ""Reload"" (1997) still sold well, they marked a stylistic shift away from their earlier thrash sound, which alienated some fans.  The haircuts were a visual representation of this change, and became symbolic for some of the shift in the band's direction.  Whether the haircuts *themselves* hurt sales is debatable, and likely impossible to prove. More probable is that the change in musical style, coupled with the changing musical landscape of the time, contributed to the perceived decline. The haircuts were likely a relatively minor factor, if a factor at all.

The Black Sea has a surface area of 436,400 sq km.  The moon has a diameter of 3,474 km, meaning a radius of 1737 km. The surface area of a circle (we'll use this as a rough approximation for the moon's cross-section) is pi*r^2, so roughly 3.14 * 1737^2 = approximately 9,500,000 sq km. The moon's cross-sectional area is considerably larger than the Black Sea. Thus the moon could not fit inside the Black Sea.

1194,Would a spider wasp be more effective than a bullet ant to stop a criminal?,"Answer: Spider wasps hunt spiders, paralyzing them with their sting to feed their larvae.  Bullet ants are known for having an incredibly painful sting, considered one of the most painful in the insect world. While both could cause significant pain and potentially deter a criminal, neither would be as effective as more traditional methods of stopping a criminal. A bullet ant's sting, while intensely painful, is unlikely to be immediately incapacitating. The spider wasp's sting is primarily meant to paralyze spiders, not humans, and its effectiveness on a human would be questionable.

1203,Is tobacco use made to seem enjoyable in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?,"Answer: In Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, the Caterpillar smokes a hookah. While the act of smoking is present, the Caterpillar's character and the overall context don't necessarily portray it as enjoyable. The Caterpillar is depicted as aloof and enigmatic, and his smoking seems more tied to his philosophical musings than to any particular pleasure.  The book doesn't explicitly endorse or condemn smoking, but it doesn't present it in a way that would entice readers to take up the habit. So while tobacco use is depicted, it isn't presented as particularly enjoyable.

Judges in the 1700s, particularly in England where much of Presbyterian influence originated, often wore wigs and robes as symbols of their office and authority.  These practices stem from traditions predating the Reformation and would likely be seen as extraneous and possibly ostentatious by a strict adherent to the relatively simpler practices of Orthodox Presbyterianism.

While they can tolerate some pollution, extreme changes in water quality can negatively affect their health and survival.  However, this tolerance and adaptability doesn't mean they aren't sensitive to their environment. Changes in environmental conditions can still influence their behavior, reproduction, and overall health. So, while resilient, they are still affected by their surroundings. {true}

1421,Can E6000 cure before a hoverboard finishes the Daytona 500?,"Here's how we break down this question:

* **E6000 Cure Time:** E6000 is a strong adhesive.  Its initial set time is relatively quick (a few minutes to an hour), but it takes 24-72 hours to fully cure.

* **Hoverboard Daytona 500:** A hoverboard, even a theoretically advanced one, is significantly slower than a race car and couldn't complete the Daytona 500.  The Daytona 500 is 500 miles. Even assuming an average speed of 20 mph, it'd take 25 hours for a hoverboard. A real race car averages over 170 mph.

* **Conclusion:**  Since the hoverboard is incredibly unlikely to finish the Daytona 500 in under 72 hours (the maximum cure time for E6000), the E6000 would almost certainly cure first.

1439,Does Hammurabi's Code violate Christians Golden Rule?,"Hammurabi's Code, while a significant step in legal history, relies heavily on the principle of ""an eye for an eye."" This means that punishments are often retributive and proportional to the crime committed. The Christian Golden Rule, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" emphasizes empathy, compassion, and treating others with the same kindness and respect you desire.  Many aspects of Hammurabi's code, particularly its emphasis on harsh, retaliatory punishments, would be considered violations of the Golden Rule by most Christian interpretations.  For example, if someone steals, the code might mandate their hand be cut off.  A Christian following the Golden Rule would not want their hand cut off for stealing and therefore should not inflict that punishment on another.

"
1445,Is it bad to have lactic acid in your body?,"Lactic acid is often portrayed negatively, likely due to its association with muscle soreness and fatigue after intense exercise. However, lactic acid itself isn't the direct cause of these sensations. It's a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, a process our bodies use to produce energy quickly when oxygen is limited. While the burning sensation during exercise is often attributed to lactic acid buildup, it's actually due to a decrease in pH within muscle cells as a result of this process.  Furthermore, lactic acid is quickly cleared from the body, usually within an hour or two after exercise. It's also important to note that lactic acid is a crucial energy source for the body. It can be converted back into glucose in the liver and used to fuel working muscles or other tissues. Therefore, having some lactic acid in your body is normal and even necessary for certain metabolic processes. It's the excessive buildup, often due to intense exertion, that can lead to temporary discomfort.

1459,Would 2020 Toyota Supra lag behind at a Nascar rally?,"Answer: NASCAR races typically involve cars specifically designed for stock car racing, often with modifications for speed and handling. The Toyota Supra, while a sports car, is not typically used in NASCAR.  NASCAR vehicles are purpose-built race cars, significantly modified from their street-legal counterparts, and are capable of much higher speeds and performance levels than a standard Toyota Supra.

"
1490,Does meat from cows fed only grass taste more like wild game?,"Answer: Wild game animals, like deer or elk, primarily eat grasses, forbs, and other vegetation.  Grass-fed beef comes from cows that are raised on a diet of pasture grasses and other forage. Grain-fed beef comes from cows raised on a diet primarily of grains, like corn.  The difference in diet can significantly affect the flavor profile of the meat.  Grain-fed beef tends to have a milder flavor and more marbling (fat within the muscle), making it more tender.  Grass-fed beef often has a leaner, more intense, and sometimes ""gamey"" flavor due to the different fat composition and the presence of certain compounds derived from the grasses they consume.  So, the taste can be similar due to diet.

1524,Did mercenaries fight for England in the Glorious Revolution?,"Answer: The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, took place in England from 1688-1689.  William of Orange invaded England with a Dutch army. While some individual soldiers within William's army might have been mercenaries, the army itself was a national army of the Dutch Republic, not a mercenary force.  The core of William's invasion force was the Dutch States Army.  Therefore, while there may have been some mercenaries *within* the Dutch army, it wasn't a mercenary army *per se*. The English forces fighting *against* James II were English.  Therefore the characterizing the conflict as England employing mercenaries is inaccurate.

"
1532,Should someone prone to jealousy be in a polyamorous relationship?,"Jealousy is a complex emotion that can arise in any type of relationship, including monogamous ones.  Polyamorous relationships, by their nature, involve multiple romantic partners, which can create more opportunities for jealousy to surface if it's an emotion someone is prone to. While some people manage jealousy successfully in polyamorous relationships through communication, self-awareness, and established boundaries, others find it too challenging. Whether or not someone prone to jealousy *should* be in a polyamorous relationship depends entirely on the individual, their capacity for self-reflection and emotional management, and their willingness to work through these feelings with their partners. It's not inherently a bad idea, but it requires careful consideration and honest self-assessment.  A person prone to jealousy would likely find polyamory difficult and potentially damaging to themselves and their partners without a significant amount of personal growth and strong communication skills.

1897,Can you listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year?,"Here's how we can figure this out:

1. **Estimate the size of the iTunes catalog:**  It's difficult to get an exact number, but estimates place the iTunes catalog (now Apple Music) at over 60 million songs. Let's use 60 million for our calculation.

2. **Calculate the total listening time:** Assuming the average song is 3 minutes long, the total listening time would be 60,000,000 songs * 3 minutes/song = 180,000,000 minutes.

3. **Convert to hours:** 180,000,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3,000,000 hours.

4. **Calculate the available hours in a year:** There are 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day, so there are 365 days/year * 24 hours/day = 8,760 hours/year.

5. **Compare listening time to available time:** 3,000,000 hours (needed) > 8,760 hours (available).
