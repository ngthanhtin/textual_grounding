127,Can Stone Cold Steve Austin apply his finisher to a mule deer?,"Answer: Stone Cold Steve Austin's finisher, the Stone Cold Stunner, involves grabbing an opponent, dropping to a seated position, and forcing the opponent's jaw to impact their shoulder. A mule deer, a large wild animal, would be extremely difficult to grab and control in the manner necessary to execute the move. Mule deer are powerful and agile, and attempting to perform a wrestling move on one would be dangerous and likely unsuccessful. Even if Stone Cold were able to get a hold of the deer, its anatomy differs significantly from a human's, making the impact of the Stunner unlikely to have the same effect.  Furthermore, the ethics of attempting such a maneuver on a wild animal are highly questionable.

A squid has one central brain and multiple smaller ganglia associated with each tentacle, but these are not considered separate brains. One blast from a shotgun, even if it hits the squid directly, is highly likely to destroy the central brain, which would effectively kill the squid. However, completely destroying *all* the neural tissue, including the relatively small and distributed ganglia in the tentacles, is less certain. The blast might not physically reach all of them. Therefore, while the squid would undoubtedly die, claiming destruction of *all* squid ""brains"" is slightly overreaching.

So the answer is {false}.
"
142,Do women often need new shoes during their pregnancy?,"Answer: Pregnant women often experience swelling in their feet, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.

Medieval English lords held significant power over the peasants who worked their land.

This lactic acid is what gives pickles their characteristic sour flavor and also acts as a preservative, preventing spoilage. While other pickling methods exist, traditional pickling relies on lactobacillus.

The DRL Racer X can reach speeds of over 160 mph, but whether it can sustain such speeds over that distance and whether it could navigate the bridge structure are unclear. While theoretically close, it's unlikely it could manage that speed for the entire duration due to battery life and maneuvering challenges.

Reagan won 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49, capturing 44 states.  To determine if there were greater landslides, we need to compare the electoral vote margins and the number of states won.  While other elections have had larger percentages of the popular vote, the electoral college is the deciding factor in presidential elections.  Looking at historical data, the 1936 election (Roosevelt vs. Landon) had a wider electoral vote margin (523 to 8) and Roosevelt won 46 states.  The 1984 election (Reagan vs. Mondale) also saw a wider margin (525 to 13) with Reagan winning 49 states.  Therefore, while the 1980 election was a landslide, there have been elections with larger margins in the Electoral College.

However, even with these measures, some pregnancies will still occur.  Factors like fetal abnormalities, risks to the mother's health, rape, and incest can lead to the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy.

Conditions like anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or certain personality disorders can sometimes be managed or concealed, at least to a degree. People develop coping mechanisms, learn to mask symptoms in social situations, or simply avoid situations that trigger their symptoms.  It's important to remember that ""hiding"" a mental disorder doesn't mean it isn't present or impacting the individual's life. It just means the symptoms aren't readily apparent to others.  It's also worth noting that the effort of concealing a mental disorder can be incredibly draining and can worsen the condition over time.

A leap year has 366 days.  There are 24 hours in a day, so a leap year has 366 * 24 = 8784 hours.

The Young and the Restless has been running since 1973.  Assuming roughly 260 episodes a year (5 per week, accounting for some breaks), there would be (2024 - 1973) * 260 = 13260 episodes.

Each episode is about 40 minutes long, which is 40/60 = 2/3 of an hour.  So, the total run time is 13260 episodes * (2/3) hours/episode = 8840 hours.

Since 8840 hours > 8784 hours, it would take longer than a leap year to binge-watch the entire series.

The question asks if $1 for each 2009 eclipse could buy a copy of TIME magazine in 2020.  This implies we need to figure out how many eclipses there were in 2009, multiply that by $1, and see if that amount is enough to buy a TIME magazine in 2020.

There were two solar eclipses in 2009 (one annular and one total). There were also two lunar eclipses. That's four eclipses total.

$1 per eclipse * 4 eclipses = $4

The price of a single issue of TIME magazine in 2020 varied, but it was generally over $5.  A subscription would be even more.

He brought with him a Dutch army, but also received support from English nobles and their forces.  While some individual soldiers within William's army might have been mercenaries in the traditional sense, the overall force wasn't a mercenary army in the way that, for instance, armies of the Italian city-states sometimes were.  The Dutch army was a national army, and while William paid some English officers to defect to his side, that's different than hiring a mercenary company. So while some individuals fighting on William's side might have been technically mercenaries, the armies involved were not primarily made up of mercenaries. {false}

If the viscosity is too low (e.g., the gelatin isn't properly dissolved or the mixture is too warm), the jello shots won't set. If the viscosity is too high (e.g., using too much gelatin), the texture might be rubbery or unpleasant. Therefore, viscosity is crucial for achieving the desired consistency of jello shots.  So the answer is {false}.

1676,Can bottlenose dolphins hypothetically outbreed human women?,"Answer: Bottlenose dolphins have a gestation period of 12 months. Human women have a gestation period of 9 months.  Reproduction rates depend on many factors, including sexual maturity age, frequency of reproduction, and number of offspring per pregnancy. These factors differ greatly between the two species and make a direct comparison challenging.  However, considering only the gestation period, a dolphin could theoretically produce slightly fewer offspring than a human over the same extended time frame. This doesn't consider any other biological factors or social structures that influence reproduction. Therefore, simply based on gestation, the premise of outbreeding is questionable.

1797,Is the QWERTY keyboard layout meant to be slow?,"Answer: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed in the 1870s for typewriters.  A common misconception is that it was designed to slow down typing to prevent the typewriters' keys from jamming.  However, the actual reason is more nuanced.  While it aimed to separate commonly used letter pairs to reduce jamming, the layout also considered factors like placing commonly used letters on the stronger fingers and alternating hands for efficient typing.  While not the most efficient layout possible, it wasn't explicitly designed to be slow. So the answer is {false}.

1812,Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?,"Answer: Sophists were ancient Greek teachers of rhetoric and philosophy who emphasized the art of persuasion, regardless of the truth.  Lawyers are also in the business of persuasion, constructing arguments to win cases. While modern legal systems value evidence and truth, the Sophists' focus on persuasive techniques could have been valuable in a legal setting.

1822,Can binary numbers and standard alphabet satisfy criteria for a strong password?,"Binary numbers use only two digits, 0 and 1.  The standard alphabet consists of 26 letters.  While using both would increase the character set available, it still falls short of recommendations for strong passwords. Strong passwords typically require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and a length of at least 12 characters.  While a password made up of binary and alphabet characters *could* be long, it lacks the diversity of character types recommended for strong security.

The availability of fast food restaurants has arguably contributed to a decrease in the need for hunting and foraging for food.  Snowshoes are used for winter travel over snow, often for hunting and foraging. However, the connection between fast food and a decrease in snowshoe use is tenuous at best, and there are many other factors that likely have a much larger impact on snowshoe usage (like urbanization, decline in hunting for food, availability of other transportation methods, etc).

1865,Do Leafhoppers compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources?,"Answer: Leafhoppers feed on plant sap. Log Cabin syrup is made from maple sap.  Therefore, leafhoppers and Log Cabin syrup producers both utilize tree sap, although from different trees. Leafhoppers can be pests to maple trees. While leafhoppers do consume tree sap, they likely don't consume enough sap to significantly impact large-scale maple syrup production, they're a pest in that they can transmit plant diseases which can affect maple tree health and sap production. Therefore, competition exists.
So the answer is {true}.
"

1868,Was proofreading Edgar Allan Poe works lucrative?,"Edgar Allan Poe struggled financially throughout his life, often living in poverty.  While he did work as an editor and literary critic, the pay was meager.  It's unlikely that proofreading his own work, even if he did it extensively, would have generated substantial income, given the limited publishing opportunities and low pay rates for writers during his time.  Any proofreading work he may have done for others wouldn't have been particularly lucrative either, for the same reasons.

The Porsche 992 Turbo S can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds.  Usain Bolt's world record for the 100m is 9.58 seconds. A quick conversion shows 60mph is roughly 26.8 meters per second.  If the Porsche maintains its initial acceleration (unlikely, but let's assume for the sake of argument), it would cover approximately 67 meters in those 2.5 seconds.  Even with some deceleration later, it would almost certainly beat Bolt to the 100-meter mark.

{true}
"
1878,Are the brooms from curling good for using on house floors?,"Answer: Curling brooms, or brushes, are specifically designed for sweeping ice in front of a curling stone to influence its speed and trajectory. They typically have heads made of horsehair, hog hair, or synthetic materials that are good at creating friction on ice.  These materials are not ideal for cleaning house floors.  Traditional brooms for household use are made of stiffer materials like straw, synthetic fibers, or even plastic bristles, designed to sweep up dirt and debris.  Using a curling broom on a household floor would likely be ineffective and could potentially damage the broom.

"
1881,Is J.D. Salinger's most successful work influential to killers?,"J.D. Salinger's most successful work is *The Catcher in the Rye*.  This novel has been cited by several assassins and would-be assassins, including Mark David Chapman (John Lennon's killer) and John Hinckley Jr. (who attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan). They seemed to identify with the protagonist Holden Caulfield's alienation and angst. While the book itself doesn't advocate violence, its themes of isolation and rebellion have resonated with some disturbed individuals who have committed violent acts.  Therefore, it could be argued that the book has been influential, though not intentionally so, to some killers.

"
1891,Can the theory of cultural hegemony explain global warming?,"Cultural hegemony refers to the dominance of one culture's values, beliefs, and practices over others. While it can influence behaviors related to resource consumption and environmental policies, it cannot directly explain the scientific phenomenon of global warming. Global warming is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, largely due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. While cultural values and practices can contribute to these activities, the underlying mechanism of global warming is rooted in physics and chemistry, not solely cultural dynamics.  A culture of consumerism, for example, fostered by powerful nations, might contribute to increased emissions, but the warming effect of those emissions is a scientific process independent of cultural influence.

Even if you listened 24/7, you wouldn't come close.

Answer: {false}
"
1898,Did the Beatles write any music in the Disco genre?,"Answer: The Beatles' main period of activity was from 1960-1970.  Disco music emerged as a genre in the early 1970s, peaking in popularity in the late 1970s.  Although some of the Beatles' later work, particularly on Abbey Road (1969), incorporated elements of funk and dance music, they predate the disco era.  While individual members may have experimented with disco influences in their solo careers after the band's breakup, The Beatles themselves did not produce any music specifically classified as disco.  {false}
"

1909,Would a Pict be confused by Old English?,"Answer: The Picts were a group of people who lived in what is now Scotland during the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval periods.  Old English developed from the Germanic languages brought to Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers starting in the 5th century.  The Pictish language, while not completely understood, is believed to be related to Brythonic Celtic languages rather than Germanic ones.  Therefore, a Pict would likely be very confused by Old English.
So the answer is {true}.
"
1910,Did Charlemagne have a bar mitzvah?,"Answer: Charlemagne was born in 742 CE.  The Bar Mitzvah is a Jewish coming-of-age ritual. Charlemagne was a Frankish king and later Holy Roman Emperor. He was Christian, not Jewish. Therefore, he would not have had a Bar Mitzvah.

"
1911,Would Garfield like canid food?,"Answer: Garfield is a cat, a member of the *felidae* family.  Canid food is designed for members of the *canidae* family, such as dogs, wolves, foxes, etc. While some ingredients might overlap, canid food isn't formulated for the specific dietary needs of cats.  Therefore, it's unlikely Garfield, or any cat, would find canid food appealing or healthy in the long term.

"
1913,Do restaurants associate meatballs with the wrong country of origin?,"Answer: Meatballs are often associated with Italian-American cuisine.  However, meatballs exist in many cultures around the world, including Middle Eastern, Asian, and Scandinavian cuisines, often predating Italian variations. While Italy certainly has its own versions of meatballs (polpette), the ubiquitous image of spaghetti and meatballs is largely an American creation. Thus, associating meatballs *exclusively* with Italy is inaccurate.

Answer: {true}
"
1914,Will the torso be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in body?,"The largest bone in the body is the femur (thigh bone).  The smallest bone is the stapes (in the ear).  A blow to the femur would certainly impact the torso, as the femur is connected to the pelvis.  A blow to the stapes, located within the ear, would not directly impact the torso. So the torso is not safe from blows to both the largest and smallest bones in the body.

1915,Can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight?,"Centurylink's max internet plan offers speeds up to 940 Mbps, which is roughly equivalent to 117.5 MBps (Megabytes per second).  A fortnight is 14 days.  Let's calculate:

117.5 MB/s * 60 s/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 14 days = 1,425,600,000 MB

1,425,600,000 MB is equal to 1,425,600 GB.  Therefore, even with overhead and potential slowdowns, uploading 1000 GB in two weeks is well within the theoretical capabilities of CenturyLink's max plan.

Answer: {false}
"
1922,Would an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility result in a supersonic shock wave?,"Answer: Explosions, especially large ones like those involving a gunpowder storage facility, release a tremendous amount of energy very rapidly.  This rapid release of energy causes the air around the explosion to be compressed and heated, forming a shock wave that expands outwards. Shock waves can travel at supersonic speeds, meaning faster than the speed of sound. So, it is likely that an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility would result in a supersonic shock wave.

Answer: {true}
"
1923,"At midnight in Times Square on New Years Eve, are you likely to meet people in diapers?","Answer: New Year's Eve in Times Square is a massive, crowded public event.

"
1931,Can a snow leopard eat twice its own body weight?,"Answer: Snow leopards typically weigh between 60 and 120 pounds.  Even at the low end of that range, twice their body weight would be 120 pounds.  While snow leopards are formidable predators, they primarily hunt prey smaller than themselves, like blue sheep, ibex, and marmots.  Consuming 120+ pounds of meat in a single sitting is highly unlikely and beyond the capacity of their digestive systems.  Large cats, like snow leopards, will make a kill and feed on it over several days, not consume it all at once.

{false}
"
1932,Is it expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla?,"Answer: Charla Nash was mauled by a chimpanzee in 2009.

Such a traumatic experience would likely cause a deep-seated fear of similar animals, including gorillas. So the answer is {true}.
"
1933,Do guitarists need both hands to play?,"Guitarists typically use one hand to fret the strings on the fretboard, selecting the notes or chords to be played.

He was a secular leader who sought to modernize and westernize Iran, and part of this involved diminishing the power of the Shia clergy. He is known to have persecuted and executed many Shia religious leaders, including imams. Jesus had twelve disciples. Considering Reza Shah's persecution of imams, it's highly improbable he believed in any of them, let alone a number exceeding twelve.

"
2162,"For Hostas to look their best, do they need lots of chlorophyll?","Answer: Hostas are known for their foliage, which comes in a variety of colors, including shades of green, blue, yellow, and white.  The green color in leaves comes from chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.  While all hostas need some chlorophyll to survive, the intensity of the green color depends on the amount of chlorophyll present. Hostas with variegated leaves, or leaves with multiple colors, have less chlorophyll in the lighter areas.  However, even these hostas need enough chlorophyll to produce the energy they need to grow.  So, while hostas don't necessarily need *lots* of chlorophyll to survive, they do need enough to thrive, and the amount needed will vary depending on the variety.  A healthy hosta, regardless of its leaf color, will have sufficient chlorophyll to support its growth.

2167,Is dopamine snorted nasally by drug users?,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. While dopamine agonists (drugs that activate dopamine receptors) are sometimes abused, dopamine itself cannot be effectively snorted. This is because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, meaning it cannot enter the brain from the bloodstream.  Therefore, snorting dopamine would not produce the desired psychoactive effects.  Drugs that *increase* dopamine levels in the brain (like cocaine or amphetamines) are sometimes snorted, but these are distinct from dopamine itself.

As an adult, he participates in the final battle against Voldemort, even destroying the final Horcrux, Nagini, which requires immense bravery.

2251,Would Immanuel Kant be disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement?,"Answer: Immanuel Kant was a proponent of the idea that all humans are ends in themselves, and possess inherent dignity and worth.  This concept is central to his moral philosophy.  While Kant lived in a time of slavery and his views on race were complex and not fully aligned with modern understandings of racial equality, his core philosophical principles emphasize respect for all rational beings.  The Black Lives Matter movement fundamentally asserts the equal dignity and worth of Black individuals, aligning with Kant's emphasis on treating all humans as ends in themselves. Therefore, it's unlikely Kant would be disgusted by a movement advocating for the equal treatment and respect of a group of people.

2253,Will a Euro sink in water?,"Answer: A Euro is a currency, specifically the official currency of the Eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union.  Physical representations of a Euro exist as coins and banknotes.  Coins and banknotes, being physical objects, have mass and volume. Water also has density.  Objects with a density greater than water will sink, while objects with a density less than water will float.  Euro coins are made of metal, and metal generally has a higher density than water.  Euro banknotes are made of paper, and while paper can absorb water and eventually sink, its initial density is often less than water.  Since the question asks if *a* Euro will sink, and there are Euro coins, the question can be answered affirmatively. {true}

2258,Is honey associated with queens?,"Answer: Honey is frequently associated with queen bees, as they are the only fertile females in a hive and are responsible for laying eggs.  Furthermore, royal jelly, a secretion produced by worker bees, is the exclusive food of the queen bee and is sometimes referred to as ""bee milk"" or even ""honey"" in colloquial terms.  The queen bee's diet of royal jelly is crucial for her development and sustained fertility. Beyond bees, ""queen"" is a title given to female monarchs, and there are numerous cultural and historical references to honey as a symbol of royalty and luxury.  Therefore, the association of honey with queens is valid through multiple lenses.

"
2259,Could Robert Wadlow hypothetically see Frankenstein's monster's bald spot from above?,"Answer: Robert Wadlow was the tallest man in recorded history, measuring 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall. Frankenstein's monster is typically depicted as being very large, but there's no canonical height.  Since the question is hypothetical, and Frankenstein's monster is fictional, it's impossible to definitively say whether Robert Wadlow could see the monster's bald spot.

While they can tolerate some temperature fluctuations,  they are not typically found in truly cold waters.

2280,Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?,"The Kingdom of Hungary had a complex and evolving system of governance. While there were periods where landowners, or the nobility, held significant power and influence in the selection of rulers, it wasn't a simple case of direct election.  The early Árpád dynasty (1000-1301) saw a system of inheritance and sometimes election by the nobility. Later, the influence of powerful magnates and foreign powers played a significant role.  There were periods of elective monarchy, but even then, the eligibility was typically limited to members of noble families or those approved by them. So, while landowners, specifically the nobility, held considerable sway in the selection of rulers at various points, a simple characterization of landowners electing their rulers is an oversimplification.
