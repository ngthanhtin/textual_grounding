4,28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,"Explanation:
First, find the net change in the number of children on the bus.  There were 28 children initially, and 30 children at the end. This means 30 - 28 = 2 more children were on the bus at the end.  Since 82 children got on, the number of children that got off must be 82 (those who got on) - 2 (the net increase) = 80 children.  Therefore, 82 - 80 = 2 more children got on the bus than got off.

27,"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the total number of items:** Matthew had 13 crackers + 15 cakes = 28 items in total.

2. **Determine the number of items per person:** He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to 28 friends. This means each friend received 28 items / 28 friends = 1 item each.

3. **Determine the number of crackers and cakes per person:** Since each friend got only one item, and the number of crackers and cakes are equal, each friend received 1/2 a cracker and 1/2 a cake.  Therefore, each person ate 0.5 crackers and 0.5 cakes. Since this is a real-world problem dealing with food items, it may be clearer to state that each person ate half a cracker and half a cake.

"
35,"Dan has $ 4. He bought a candy bar for $ 8. Then his friend have him $ 5, how much money is left?","Answer: First, we need to determine if Dan has enough money to buy the candy bar.  He starts with $4 but the candy bar costs $8, meaning he is short $4 ($8 - $4 = $4).  We assume he borrows the money or the transaction doesn't happen (it's not possible for him to buy it with only $4). If the transaction does not happen, he still has $4. If he borrows $4 and buys the candy bar, he has $0 left. His friend then gives him $5, so he has $5.
If he borrows the money, the correct calculation is: $4 (starting amount) - $8 (candy bar cost) + $5 (friend's money) = $1.

However, the problem is poorly worded. It's unclear if the candy bar purchase actually occurs.  Assuming the purchase happened and he borrowed the money, he would have $1.  If the purchase did not happen he would have $9.  Due to the ambiguity, we'll assume the transaction went through.

36,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?","The problem provides information about the number of visitors on a single day (246) and the number of visitors on the previous day (703).  However, this information is irrelevant to the question of how many visitors came in 25 days.  We need an assumption to solve the problem.  We will assume that the number of visitors each day is consistent.


If we assume a consistent average number of visitors per day, we must first find the average number of visitors per day.  This is not directly given, and using the provided single day count could be misleading.


Since we lack sufficient information to determine the average daily number of visitors over a longer period, we cannot accurately calculate the total number of visitors over 25 days. The problem needs more information about the daily visitor numbers to be solved correctly.

88,Paco had 12 cookies. He ate 16 cookies and gave 21 of them to his friend. How many more cookies did he give to his friend than those he ate?,"First, we need to determine how many cookies Paco had in total.  The problem states he started with 12 cookies, but ate 16 and gave away 21.  Since he ate more cookies than he started with, this indicates that he must have had additional cookies beyond the initial 12.  To find out how many additional cookies he had, let's assume he had x additional cookies.  This means he started with 12 + x cookies.  He then ate 16, leaving (12 + x) - 16 cookies.  Finally, he gave 21 cookies away.  The total number of cookies given away and eaten must be less than or equal to his total.

However, the wording of the problem is problematic.  It's impossible for Paco to have eaten 16 cookies and given away 21 cookies if he only started with 12. The question contains an error.  Let's assume the problem meant that he started with 12 cookies, and then *obtained* another number of cookies before eating and giving some away. Without further clarification this is impossible to solve.

Let's reframe the problem. If the problem stated that Paco *had* a total of 12 + x cookies, ate 16, leaving (12 + x) - 16, and gave away 21, we can't solve the problem without knowing x.

If the problem correctly stated Paco had 12 cookies, ate 16, then *borrowed* some more before giving away 21, that still cannot be calculated.

135,"A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes, how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?","The farmer initially had 175 tomatoes.  The number of tomatoes didn't change, so he still has 175 tomatoes.

He initially had 77 potatoes. He picked 172 potatoes, but this is impossible since he only had 77 to begin with.  We assume there's a mistake in the problem statement.  If he picked *all* his potatoes, he would have 0 potatoes left.  If the problem meant he picked 77 potatoes, he would have 0 potatoes remaining.

If we assume he only had 77 potatoes to begin with and picked them all, then he has:

175 tomatoes + 0 potatoes = 175 tomatoes and potatoes total.


If he picked 172 potatoes (presumably a typo,  as this is more potatoes than he started with), we have to make an assumption.  Let's assume the question is flawed, and he picked all 77 potatoes.

1. **Find the total number of items:** Matthew had 10 crackers + 8 cakes = 18 items in total.

2. **Find the number of items per friend:** He gave equal numbers of items to 4 friends, so each friend received 18 items / 4 friends = 4.5 items.  Since you can't give half an item, there's a slight error in the problem's wording; he couldn't have given equal amounts of both crackers and cakes.  Let's assume the problem meant he gave away as many cakes as possible, while distributing the crackers equally.

3. **Determine cakes per friend:**  If he gave away as many cakes as possible equally among his 4 friends, that would be 8 cakes / 4 friends = 2 cakes per friend.

159,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?,"First, we need to find the number of students per classroom. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 58 students / 87 classrooms ≈ 0.67 students/classroom.  However, this result doesn't make sense since you can't have a fraction of a student.  There seems to be an error in the problem statement.  The number of students (58) is less than the number of classrooms (87).  It's impossible for each classroom to have the same number of students if there aren't enough students to fill all the classrooms.

Assuming the problem intended to say there are 87 students instead of 58, then we'd proceed as follows:

1. **Students per classroom:** If there are 87 students and 87 classrooms, each classroom has 87 students / 87 classrooms = 1 student per classroom.

2. **Students per bus:** Each bus has 2 seats.

3. **Buses needed:** To transport all 87 students, we need 87 students / 2 students/bus = 43.5 buses.  Since we can't have half a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the school would need 44 buses.

To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to work backward from the current number of bottle caps.  He currently has 33 bottle caps.  He found 63 more, meaning before finding those caps, he had 33 - 63 = -30 bottle caps.  This negative number indicates that he had already thrown away more bottle caps than he had in his collection at the beginning of the day.

How many apples did Rachel pick in all?,"Answer: Rachel initially had 4 trees * 7 apples/tree = 28 apples on her trees.  She picked 28 - 29 = -1 apples (This should be 28 - 29 = -1, there's a mistake in the problem statement because you cannot pick a negative number of apples).  If we assume that 29 apples are left on the trees *after* she picked some apples, the problem would be solvable.  In that case, Rachel picked 4*7 - 29 = 28 - 29 = -1 apples.  This is impossible, so there must be an error in the problem statement. If the problem meant that there were initially 29 apples on the trees in total before picking any apples, then she picked a total of 29 -28 = 1 apples.   Lets assume the question meant to say that there were 29 apples left *after* she picked 7 apples from each tree. In that case, she picked 4 * 7 = 28 apples.

209,Paco had 6 cookies. He gave 30 cookies to his friend and ate 23 cookies. How many more cookies did he give to his friend than those he ate?,"Explanation:
First, we need to determine how many cookies Paco had in total.  The problem states he *gave away* 30 cookies and *ate* 23 cookies.  This implies he initially possessed more than 30 + 23 = 53 cookies.  The problem states he started with 6 cookies.  This information is contradictory.  We will assume the problem meant Paco *had* 6 cookies initially.

If Paco started with 6 cookies, and gave away 30, he would have needed to have 30 - 6 = 24 more cookies.  The problem is inconsistent in its given information. However, if we disregard the initial 6 cookies and only consider what the question asks, which is the difference between the number of cookies given away (30) and the number eaten (23), we can proceed.

289,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?","To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of visitors over two days and then extrapolate that to an estimate over 57 days.  However, we're given no information to suggest that the number of visitors will remain constant. The number of paintings in the palace is irrelevant to this calculation.


The number of visitors on the two days mentioned is 557 + 188 = 745 visitors.

We cannot reliably estimate the number of visitors over 57 days based on only two days' worth of data.  The number of visitors could vary greatly from day to day due to various factors (day of the week, season, special events, etc.).  Therefore, we cannot give a precise answer to how many visitors there were in 57 days.  Any attempt to extrapolate would be a highly unreliable guess.

"
303,Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 4 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find Jill's peaches:** Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, and Steven has 4 peaches.  Therefore, Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches.  Since you can't have a negative number of peaches, there must be an error in the problem statement.  Let's assume the problem meant to say Steven has 11 *fewer* peaches than Jill.  In that case, Jill has 4 + 11 = 15 peaches.

2. **Find Jake's peaches:** Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 4 peaches.  Therefore, Jake has 4 - 12 = -8 peaches. Again, this is impossible. Let's assume the problem intended to say Jake has 12 *more* peaches than Steven. In that case, Jake has 4 + 12 = 16 peaches.


3. **Find the difference:** If Jill has 15 peaches and Jake has 16 peaches, Jake has 1 more peach than Jill. The question asks for the difference between the number of peaches Jill has and the number of peaches Jake has. Since there are errors in the original wording, let's assume Jill has 15 and Jake has 16.  Then Jill has 15 - 16 = -1 more peaches than Jake.  Meaning Jake has 1 more peach than Jill.

Let's try using the original, erroneous wording: If Jill has -7 peaches and Jake has -8 peaches, Jill has -7 - (-8) = 1 more peach than Jake.


Because of the contradictory information in the problem, we need to make assumptions about what the question *intended* to ask. The most likely assumption would be that the question meant Steven had 11 fewer peaches than Jill and Jake had 12 fewer peaches than Steven.


**If the question meant Steven had 11 fewer peaches than Jill and Jake had 12 fewer peaches than Steven:**
* Jill has 4 + 11 = 15 peaches
* Jake has 15 -12 = 3 peaches
* Jill has 15 - 3 = 12 more peaches than Jake.

306,"There are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 14 of the movies and watched 19 of the books, how many more books than movies have you read?","First, we need to find out how many books and movies were consumed in total.  The problem states that there are 10 different books and that 19 of the books were watched (presumably meaning read, as one watches movies, not books).  The problem states that there are 6 different movies and 14 of the movies were read (presumably meaning watched, as one watches movies, not reads them).

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of books ""read"" and movies ""watched"".  This is done by subtracting the number of movies watched from the number of books read: 19 books - 14 movies = 5.

Therefore, 5 more books were read than movies watched.

307,"Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left, how many days did she drink for?","To find out how many days Debby drank water bottles, we first need to determine how many bottles she drank in total.  We can do this by subtracting the number of bottles she has left from the original number of bottles she bought:

Total bottles drank = Total bottles bought - Bottles left
Total bottles drank = 301 - 157 = 144 bottles

Now, we know she drank 144 bottles per day.  To find the number of days, we divide the total number of bottles drank by the number of bottles she drank per day:

Number of days = Total bottles drank / Bottles drank per day
Number of days = 144 / 144 = 1 day

333,There were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,"To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we first need to determine how many roses were removed from the vase.  She started with 2 roses and threw away 4.  Since she can't throw away more roses than were originally there, this means there must have been at least 4 roses in the vase, even though she only started with 2.  Let's assume that there were additional roses that she didn't mention. She ended up with 23 roses. To figure out how many roses she added, we subtract the number of roses she started with and the number of roses she ended with: 23 (final amount) - 2 (initial amount) = 21 roses.

However, this calculation doesn't account for the 4 roses she threw away. This suggests the problem is contradictory, indicating a mistake in the initial conditions. If she started with 2 roses, throwing away 4 is not possible.  Let's assume the problem meant to say she *added* 4 roses initially instead of throwing them away.  Then:

Starting roses: 2
Added roses (initially, incorrectly phrased as throwing away): 4
Total before new roses: 2 + 4 = 6 roses
Roses in vase at the end: 23
Roses cut from garden: 23 - 6 = 17 roses

350,"After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died. If she had grown 3 trees initially, how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?","Explanation:
Haley initially had 3 trees. After the typhoon, 13 trees died.  This means that the number of trees that survived is 3 - 13 = -10. Since you can't have a negative number of trees, it means that all 3 initial trees and an additional 10 trees died. The number of trees that died more than the number that survived is 13 - 0 = 13 (or 13 - (-10) = 23). The question asks how many more trees died than survived. Since all the initial trees died, and 10 additional trees died, the number of trees that died is 13 and the number that survived is 0.  Therefore, 13 more trees died than survived.

2. **Find how many peaches Jill has:** Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill.  Since Jake has 7 peaches, Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches.  This means Jill has 11 fewer peaches than Jake.

If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon, how many students suggested bacon?","Let's say 'x' represents the number of students who suggested adding bacon.
Since 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is x + 63.

426,"Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends, how many cakes did each person eat?","Explanation:
First, find the total number of crackers and cakes Matthew has. He had 29 crackers and 30 cakes, so he has a total of 29 + 30 = 59 items.

Next, find the number of items each friend received.  Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to 2 friends, each friend received 59 / 2 = 29.5 items.  However, you can't give half a cracker or cake.  This means there was a slight inaccuracy in the question's wording, implying that each friend received a number that would be close to equal, not exactly equal.  Therefore, it's necessary to determine how many cakes each friend received.

To do this, we can assume Matthew attempted to distribute the items as evenly as possible.  The most even way to distribute the 30 cakes between two people is to give each friend 15 cakes. The remaining cracker would likely be kept by Matthew.

469,Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **David's push-ups:** David did 15 (Zachary's push-ups) + 39 = 54 push-ups.

2. **John's push-ups:** John did 54 (David's push-ups) - 9 = 45 push-ups.

If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that, how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the total visitors over the previous two days:** Add the number of visitors from the previous day (191) and the day before that (457).  191 + 457 = 648 visitors.

2. **Find the difference in visitors:** Subtract the total visitors from the previous two days (648) from the number of visitors on the current day (705). 705 - 648 = 57 visitors.

3. **The question is misleading:** The problem asks for the difference between visitors on that day and the previous 245 days, but only provides data for two days.  We can only calculate the difference compared to the previous two days.

Therefore, the answer is 57 more visitors on the current day compared to the previous two days.  The question's inclusion of ""245 days"" is irrelevant with the given information.

512,"David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups, how many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?","Answer: David did 38 push-ups.  Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups.  Since it's not possible to do a negative number of push-ups, there must be an error in the problem statement.  Assuming the problem meant David did 56 *more* push-ups than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 pushups which is impossible.  If the problem meant that David did 56 pushups *less* than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 + 56 = 94 push-ups. Then together they did 38 + 94 = 132 push-ups.  However, the problem states David did *more* push-ups.  There's an inconsistency in the problem.  If we assume the question meant David did 56 fewer pushups than Zachary, then Zachary did 94 push-ups and together they did 132 pushups.  If we assume the question is correct and accept a negative number of pushups for Zachary then together they did 20 pushups (38 + (-18)). However given the context this is unlikely.  Therefore the most likely intended answer is 132, but the question is flawed.

649,"Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends, how many crackers did each person eat?","Explanation:
First, find the total number of crackers and cakes Matthew has: 22 crackers + 34 cakes = 56 items.
Next, divide the total number of items by the number of friends to find how many items each friend receives: 56 items / 11 friends = 5.09 items per friend.  Since Matthew can only give whole items, each friend receives 5 items.
Since each friend receives an equal number of crackers and cakes, and each friend receives 5 items, each friend receives 5/2 = 2.5 crackers and 2.5 cakes. However, it's impossible to give half a cracker or cake. Therefore, each friend can receive a maximum of 2 crackers and 3 cakes.  The problem asks how many crackers each person ate.  Given the distribution would need to be whole items, each friend received at most 2 crackers.

652,"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 17 classrooms. There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full, how many seats are in each bus?","Here's how to solve the problem:

The number of classrooms and the number of students in the school are irrelevant to the problem of determining how many seats are in each bus.  The problem only requires knowing the total number of students and the number of buses.  Since each bus is full, the total number of seats is equal to the total number of students. To find the number of seats per bus, we divide the total number of students by the number of buses.

Calculation: 92 students / 46 buses = 2 seats per bus

675,Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?,"First, we need to determine how many pages are in each chapter.  The book has 193 pages and 15 chapters, so each chapter has 193 pages / 15 chapters = 12.866... pages. Since we can't have a fraction of a page, this must be a mistake in the problem statement.  Let's assume there's a typo and each chapter has approximately the same number of pages.  If the pages are distributed equally among chapters, it's not a perfect division.

Let's assume the book has approximately the same number of pages per chapter for simplicity. This means that he read roughly one chapter every 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days.

To find the number of chapters he read *per day*, we should have divided the number of chapters by the number of days. 15 chapters / 660 days is approximately 0.0227 chapters per day.  However, given the fact it takes more than a day to read a chapter, we should instead calculate how many chapters are read per day by dividing the number of days by the number of chapters:

660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter

This means that he read approximately 1/44 of a chapter per day.

Answer: {1/44}

The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?","The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.  The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, meaning the frog jumped 19 - 4 = 15 inches. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, meaning the mouse jumped 15 - 44 = -29 inches (This indicates the problem statement might contain an error as the mouse cannot jump a negative distance). However, if we consider the wording strictly and that the question is actually asking how far the frog jumped, the answer is 15 inches.

696,"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs, how many eggs does Rebecca have?","Explanation:
The problem states that Rebecca wants to split her eggs into groups of 11 eggs each.  However, it then contradicts itself by saying each group has only 2 eggs.  This is a flawed problem statement. If each group contains 2 eggs, the number of groups doesn't matter; the number of eggs per group determines the total number of eggs in each group, which is 2.  To get a meaningful answer, we need to correct the problem.  Let's assume the problem meant to say ""Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups, with 11 groups of 2 eggs each.""

If Rebecca splits her eggs into 11 groups of 2 eggs each, then she has 11 groups * 2 eggs/group = 22 eggs.

714,"Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes, how many students suggested bacon?","Let's say the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is 'x'.
The number of students who suggested bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes, so it's 'x + 166'.
The total number of students who made suggestions is 182.  Therefore, the sum of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon is 182.  This can be written as an equation:

x + (x + 166) = 182

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 166 = 182

Subtracting 166 from both sides:

2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 8

So, 8 students suggested mashed potatoes.

The number of students who suggested bacon is x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174

Let's say Jerry initially had 'x' action figures on the shelf.
He added 2 more, so the total became x + 2.
Then he removed 7, so the total became (x + 2) - 7.
We know that there are 10 action figures left, so we can set up an equation:
(x + 2) - 7 = 10
Simplifying the equation:
x - 5 = 10
Adding 5 to both sides:
x = 15

730,"Paul had 21 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones. If he has 15 books now, how many more books did he sell than he bought?","Explanation:
First, find the total number of books Paul had after buying new ones: 21 (initial books) - x (sold books) + 42 (new books) = 63 - x.
Then, subtract the number of books he currently has from the total number of books after buying new ones: 63 - x - 15 = 48 - x. This represents the number of books he sold.
Finally, find the difference between the number of books sold and the number of books bought: (48 - x) - 42 = 6 - x. Since this value is not directly calculable, we can approach this differently.

The number of books Paul has now is 15.  He started with 21 and bought 42 more, which is a total of 63 books (21 + 42 = 63).  To get to 15 books, he sold 63 - 15 = 48 books.  The difference between the number of books sold (48) and the number of books bought (42) is 48 - 42 = 6.

784,Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?,"Explanation:
First, we need to determine how many marbles each boy had after their playground experiences.  Ed started with 24 more marbles than Doug, meaning if Doug had 'x' marbles, Ed had 'x + 24'.

Doug lost 27 marbles, so he now has 'x - 27' marbles.
Ed found 9 more marbles, so he now has '(x + 24) + 9' marbles, which simplifies to 'x + 33'.

To find the difference, subtract Doug's current number of marbles from Ed's current number of marbles:

(x + 33) - (x - 27) = x + 33 - x + 27 = 60

807,"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially, how many crackers did each person eat?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the total number of items:** Matthew had 32 crackers + 98 cakes = 130 items in total.

2. **Find the number of items per friend:** Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, each friend received 130 items / 4 friends = 32.5 items.  However, since you can't give half a cracker or cake, there must be a mistake in the problem statement as it's impossible to distribute items equally in this scenario.  The problem states he gave equal numbers of *crackers and cakes*, which means the number of crackers and cakes given to each friend are the same, but the total number of items given to each friend are not the same.

3. **Assuming equal crackers and cakes per friend:** We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 32 and 98 to determine the maximum number of crackers and cakes each friend could receive equally.

The GCD of 32 and 98 is 2.  This means that the maximum number of crackers and cakes that can be equally distributed is 2 of each.

4. **Number of crackers per person:** Therefore, each friend received 2 crackers.

How many apples does Bob have?,"First, we need to find out how many apples Adam and Jackie each have. Let's use 'x' to represent the number of apples Jackie has.  Adam has 4 more than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 apples.  Together they have 14 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14.  This simplifies to 2x + 4 = 14. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 2x = 10, and dividing by 2 gives x = 5.  Therefore, Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many apples Bob has. Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. Adam and Jackie have a total of 5 + 9 = 14 apples.  Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples.

810,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, how many more cups of flour does she need to add?","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the difference in cups between flour and sugar:**

The recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar, meaning a difference of 13 - 6 = 7 more cups of sugar than flour.

**2. Determine the additional flour needed:**

Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.  This means she needs 8 + 7 = 15 cups of flour more than sugar.  Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, she will need 15 + 6 = 21 cups of flour in total.

**3. Calculate the additional flour to add:**

Since she needs 21 cups total and has already put in some amount (let's call this x), she still needs to add 21 - x cups of flour.  The problem only tells us she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, which means that the amount of flour she's already added is not relevant to the question.  The only important thing is she needs 15 more cups of flour than sugar and the recipe requires 6 cups of flour.  This means she will need to add an additional 15 cups of flour.

The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Frog's jump:** The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches.  Since a negative jump isn't possible, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. We'll assume the problem meant to say the grasshopper jumped 25 inches *less* than the frog.  Therefore, the frog jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches.

2. **Mouse's jump:** The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches.

3. **Difference:** The grasshopper jumped 21 inches and the mouse jumped 30 inches. The difference is 30 - 21 = 9 inches.

If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days, how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?","To find the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited, we first need to find the total number of visitors in the 84 days before Rachel's visit.  Since 45 visitors came on the previous day, and there were a total of 829 visitors in the 85 days, the number of visitors in the 84 days before Rachel's visit is 829 - 45 = 784 visitors.  This calculation is incorrect because it ignores the fact that an unknown number of people visited on the day Rachel visited. We need to subtract the number of visitors for the previous day only.

Therefore, to find the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited, we subtract the total number of visitors in the previous 84 days from the total number of visitors in the 85 days.

Number of visitors on Rachel's visit day = Total visitors in 85 days - Total visitors in the previous 84 days
Number of visitors on Rachel's visit day = 829 - (829 - 45)
Number of visitors on Rachel's visit day = 829 - 784
Number of visitors on Rachel's visit day = 45

To find the number of flower beds, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed: 36 seeds / 12 seeds/flower bed = 3 flower beds. The information about how many seeds grew into flowers (58 seeds) is extra information and not needed to solve the problem.

997,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?,"First, we need to determine how many flower beds Paige and her mom planted.  They planted 55 seeds total, and put 15 seeds in each bed.  Therefore, they planted 55 seeds / 15 seeds/bed = 3.67 beds. Since you can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we round this down to 3 flower beds.  (It's implied the remaining seeds were either not planted or didn't make it to a flowerbed).

Next, we determine how many seeds grew into flowers.  They planted 3 flower beds and 60 seeds grew in each bed, so 3 beds * 60 seeds/bed = 180 seeds.

However, the question states they only planted 55 seeds total. Therefore we must use the number of seeds planted, not the number of seeds that *could* have grown in each bed. There were 55 seeds planted and 60 seeds grew per flower bed. This is not possible.  There is contradictory information within the problem.  We will assume that 60 seeds per flower bed is incorrect, and that we should only consider the 55 seeds that were planted.

The problem doesn't state that *all* 55 seeds grew.  It only says they planted 55 seeds and that there are 15 seeds per flower bed.  Assuming each seed grows into a flower, and we're using the 3 flower beds (the whole number from 55/15), then the number of flowers grown is 55.
