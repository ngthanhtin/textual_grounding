27,"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?","Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes. He cannot divide 13 crackers and 15 cakes equally among 28 friends without cutting the crackers and cakes into fractions. It is implicitly assumed in the problem that each friend must receive a whole number of crackers and cakes. Since 13 and 15 are not evenly divisible by 28, some crackers and cakes will be left over.
However, if the question intends to ask how many crackers and cakes Matthew *gave out* in total, we can proceed as follows: Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend, he could give a maximum of 0 crackers and 0 cakes to each friend. This means he gave out a total of 0 crackers and 0 cakes.

Answer: {0 crackers and 0 cakes}

It then says you *read* 19 movies and *watched* 16 books. This is a trick question, playing on the usual association of ""reading"" with books and ""watching"" with movies.  You can't read a movie or watch a book. You read 0 movies. You watched/read 16 books. Therefore, you have read 16-0=16 more books than movies.

49,Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?,"Nell started with 309 baseball cards + 356 Ace cards = 665 cards total.
She gave some away and has 415 cards left.
So she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards.
Since she gave away cards and ended up with more baseball cards than Ace cards, she must have given away more Ace cards than baseball cards.  However, we are only asked how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell *has*.

Nell has 415 cards left.  Let 'x' be the number of baseball cards she has left. Then she has 415 - x Ace cards.  We are looking for the difference between the number of baseball cards and the number of Ace cards Nell has left.

We aren't told exactly how many of each type of card she gave away, so we can't determine exactly how many of each she has left. But we know she started with 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, so she started with 356 - 309 = 47 more Ace cards.

Let 'b' be the number of baseball cards Nell gave away, and let 'a' be the number of Ace cards Nell gave away.
Then b + a = 250.

Number of baseball cards left = 309 - b
Number of Ace cards left = 356 - a

Difference in cards left = (309 - b) - (356 - a) = a - b - 47
We don't know a or b.

However, we *do* know that the total number of cards she has left is 415.
Baseball cards left + Ace cards left = 415
Let B be baseball cards left and A be Ace cards left.
B + A = 415
We are looking for B - A = ?

Let's think of it this way: Nell started with 47 more Ace cards. She gave away some cards.
Suppose she gave away an equal number of both types of cards. Then she would still have 47 more Ace cards. But we know that after giving away some cards, she had a total of 415 cards. Let 'x' be the number of baseball cards she has. Then she has 415-x Ace cards. 
The difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards is given as
x - (415 - x) = 2x - 415
This is equal to some number.

If we knew how many baseball cards she gave away and how many Ace cards she gave away, we could answer.

Without additional information, we cannot determine how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. The provided information is not sufficient.
Answer: {The provided information is not sufficient}

If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially, how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?","Initially, there were 45 bird families near the mountain. 86 bird families flew away for the winter. This means 45 - 86 = -41. Since the question asks how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind. Let's find how many families stayed behind: 45 - 86 = -41, which means there were no families left, and in fact, 41 more families flew away than were initially there. So, 41 more families flew away than stayed behind (which is 0). The difference between the number of families that flew away (86) and the number that stayed (which is 45 - 86 = -41, meaning 0 stayed behind since it cannot be negative) is 86 - 0 = 86. However, since 41 more bird families flew away, we'll use 41 as that accounts for the excess. Since all the original families left and 41 additional families left, this means 41 more families flew away than stayed. Alternatively, if we interpret ""stayed behind"" as the number of families initially there, the difference between the families that flew away and families initially there is 86 - 45 = 41.

If you read 14 of the movies and watched 19 of the books, how many more books than movies have you read?","The question states there are 10 books and 6 movies.  It then asks how many more books than movies *you have read*. You watched 19 books (which is impossible since there are only 10 books), and read 14 movies (which is impossible since there are only 6 movies). The question seems to have intentionally mixed up movies and books to confuse the reader. Since we can only read books and watch movies, the question should be asking ""how many more books than movies *have you watched*?"". In that case, you have watched 19 - 14 = 5 more books. If we change ""watched"" to ""read"", you read 14 movies, which is impossible.
The question is improperly written and has several issues.  However, if we take the question literally, you read 19 books and 14 movies. So, the difference would be 19-14=5.

Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,"Marco and his dad initially collected 22 pounds of strawberries.

498,5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,"Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
63 children got off the bus, so there were 5 - 63 = -58 children. This means the bus was empty.
Then, some children got on, and the total became 14. So, 14 children got on the bus.
The difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 14 - 63 = -49.
However, the question asks how many *more* got on than got off.  Since 14 got on and 63 got off, 63-14 = 49 *fewer* children got on compared to the number who got off, or 49 *more* got off than got on.  So we are looking for a positive number.  We can conclude that 49 *more* children got off the bus than got on the bus.  
The wording of the problem has an issue: the number of children can't be negative.  It must be the case that more children got on the bus than got off.
At the first stop, 63 children got off the bus, leaving 5-63=-58. It's not possible for the number of children on the bus to be negative.
Let's assume that the 5 children initially on the bus was a typo, and there were 68 children on the bus.
63 got off, leaving 68-63=5. Then some more got on, for a total of 14. Thus 14-5=9 more children got on.
The question asks how many more children got on than got off, which is 9-63=-54.
Let's calculate how many got on. After the 63 got off, there were 14-63 = -49. Because the number of kids cannot be negative, we can't find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. Assuming the question meant how many more children got off than got on the answer would be 63 - 14 = 49.
Given that the question must have a real answer, we are going to work backwards. At the end of the problem, there are 14 students on the bus. If 63 students got off, there must have been 14+63=77 students on the bus originally, not 5. So 5 is incorrect. 63 students got off, and there were originally 77 students. That means at that stop, 14-0=14 students got on the bus. The question is How many more children got on the bus than those that got off? So, 63-14 =49 more got off than on.

512,"David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups, how many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?","David did 38 push-ups. Zachary did 56 fewer push-ups than David, so Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. Since it's not possible to do negative push-ups, there must be an error in the problem. Perhaps it meant to say that Zachary did 56 push-ups *less* than David. Let's assume the problem meant that David did 56 *more* push-ups than Zachary. In that case, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups, which again doesn't make sense. It seems that the question is flawed. However, if David did 56 more than Zachary, and David did 38, then Zachary did 38-56 = -18. Since Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 pushups, we can assume that the question meant David did 38 and Zachary did 38-56, but since the answer is negative, it means Zachary did 0 pushups. Thus, 38 + 0 = 38.

If we assume the question meant Zachary did 56 push-ups and David did 56 more than him, David would have done 56 + 56 = 112 push-ups. Altogether, they did 56 + 112 = 168 push-ups.  However, the question explicitly states David did 38 push-ups.

If David did 38 and did 56 MORE than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18, which is not possible.  Thus, Zachary must have done 0. Together, they did 38 + 0 = 38.
