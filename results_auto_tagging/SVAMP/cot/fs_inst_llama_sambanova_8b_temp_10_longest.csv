If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack, how much do you have to pay to buy each pack?","Each pack of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each pack. To find the price after the discount, we need to subtract the discount from the original price.

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $76 - $25
Price after discount = $51

The answer is {51}."
1,"Dan had $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar. If he had $ 4 at the start, how much did the candy bar cost?","To find the cost of the candy bar, we need to subtract the amount Dan had left from the amount he had initially. 

Dan had $4 initially and $3 left after buying the candy bar. 

So, the cost of the candy bar is $4 - $3 = $1.

3,43 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some children got off the bus. Then there were 21 children left on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?,"To find the number of children who got off the bus, we need to subtract the number of children left on the bus from the initial number of children.

Initial number of children = 43
Number of children left on the bus = 21

Number of children who got off the bus = Initial number of children - Number of children left on the bus
= 43 - 21
= 22

The answer is {22}."
4,28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.
2. Then, 82 children got on the bus, making the total number of children on the bus 28 + 82 = 110.
3. However, after some children got off the bus, there were 30 children left on the bus.
4. So, the number of children who got off the bus is 110 - 30 = 80.

Now, let's find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off:

The number of children who got on the bus is 82.
The number of children who got off the bus is 80.

The difference between the two is 82 - 80 = 2.

So, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

5,There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?,"To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to first find out how much money she had initially, and then subtract the amount she spent from the amount she collected.

Olivia initially had $3 in her wallet. She then collected $49 from the ATM. So, she had a total of $3 + $49 = $52.

After visiting the supermarket, she had $49 left. This means she spent $52 - $49 = $3 at the supermarket.

Now, to find out how much more money she collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we subtract the amount she spent from the amount she collected: $49 (collected) - $3 (spent) = $46.

The answer is {$46}."
6,"Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. If there are a total of 10 action figures on his shelf now, how many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?","To find out how many action figures Jerry had initially on the shelf, we need to subtract the number of action figures he added later from the total number of action figures on the shelf now.

Let's say Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf.

Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, making the total number of action figures 10.

So, we can write the equation as: x + 7 = 10

To find the value of x, we need to subtract 7 from both sides of the equation.

x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7
x = 3

Therefore, Jerry had 3 action figures initially on the shelf.

Answer: {3}"
7,Paco had 41 cookies. He gave 9 cookies to his friend and ate 18 cookies. How many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend?,"To find out how many more cookies Paco ate than those he gave to his friend, we need to first find out how many cookies he ate and how many cookies he gave to his friend.

Paco had 41 cookies initially. He gave 9 cookies to his friend and ate 18 cookies. 

To find out how many cookies he had left after giving some to his friend, we subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the initial number of cookies. 
41 - 9 = 32 cookies left.

However, we know that he ate 18 cookies. So, to find out how many cookies he ate, we don't need to do anything because we already know that he ate 18 cookies.

Now, to find out how many more cookies he ate than those he gave to his friend, we subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate.
18 - 9 = 9

The answer is {9}."

11,"They decided to hold the party in their backyard. If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, how many chairs do they have in the backyard?","To find the total number of chairs in the backyard, we need to multiply the number of sets of tables by the number of chairs in each set.

Number of sets of tables = 11
Number of chairs in each set = 13

Total number of chairs = Number of sets of tables * Number of chairs in each set
Total number of chairs = 11 * 13
Total number of chairs = 143

The answer is {143}."
12,"In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girls, how many pupils are there in that school?","To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to find the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. We are given that there are 458 more girls than boys, and we know that there are 692 girls. 

Let's denote the number of boys as x. Since there are 458 more girls than boys, we can write the equation: x + 458 = 692.

To solve for x, we subtract 458 from both sides of the equation: x = 692 - 458.

x = 234.

This means that there are 234 boys in the school. To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys to the number of girls: 234 + 692 = 926.

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in the school.

Answer: {926}"
13,"After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet, how deep was the water?","To find the depth of the water, we need to first find Dean's height. We know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, and Ron stands at 13 feet. 

So, Dean's height is 13 + 4 = 17 feet.

We are also given that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. 

Therefore, the depth of the water is 15 * 17 = 255 feet.

The answer is {255}."
14,6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. How many birds are sitting on the fence?,"Initially, there were 6 birds on the fence. 4 more birds joined them, making a total of 6 + 4 = 10 birds. Then, 8 more storks joined them, but storks are not birds, so they do not add to the count of birds. Therefore, the total number of birds sitting on the fence is still 10.

15,Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,"To find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weighed after losing some, we first need to determine how much they weighed before. 

Marco and his dad collected a total of 36 pounds of strawberries. After Marco's dad lost 8 pounds, Marco was left with 12 pounds. This means that the 8 pounds lost by Marco's dad must have been the weight of his strawberries, as Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds after the loss.

So, the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries before the loss was 8 pounds. 

However, we need to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed after losing 8 pounds. Since they lost 8 pounds, the weight after the loss would be the initial weight minus the lost weight.

Therefore, the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries after losing 8 pounds is 8 pounds.

The answer is {8}."
16,"In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys, how many boys are there in that school?","To find the number of boys in the school, we need to first find the total number of students. We know that there are 697 girls and that there are 228 more girls than boys. Let's represent the number of boys as 'x'. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can write an equation:

697 = x + 228

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 228 from both sides:

697 - 228 = x
469 = x

So, there are 469 boys in the school.

The answer is {469}."
17,In a school there are 732 girls and 761 boys. 682 more girls and 8 more boys joined the school. How many girls are there in the school now?,"To find the total number of girls in the school now, we first need to calculate the initial number of girls and then add the number of new girls who joined.

The initial number of girls is 732.

682 more girls joined the school, so we add this to the initial number of girls:

732 + 682 = 1414

Therefore, the total number of girls in the school now is 1414.

Answer: {1414}"
18,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?,"To find out how many wrappers Danny had at first, we need to know how many wrappers he has now and how many wrappers he found at the park. We are also given the number of bottle caps he found at the park. 

We know that Danny has 57 wrappers now and he found 30 wrappers at the park. To find out how many wrappers he had at first, we need to subtract the number of wrappers he found from the number of wrappers he has now.

However, we also need to consider the bottle caps, as the question asks for the number of wrappers he had at first. The number of bottle caps he has now and the number of bottle caps he found at the park will help us determine if we need to add or subtract any bottle caps from the wrappers.

Danny has 17 bottle caps now and he found 22 bottle caps at the park. This means that he must have had 17 - 22 = -5 bottle caps before going to the park. Since we can't have a negative number of bottle caps, this means that he must have had 22 - 17 = 5 bottle caps before going to the park.

Now we know that he had 5 bottle caps before going to the park. Since the number of bottle caps and wrappers are independent of each other, we don't need to consider the bottle caps when calculating the number of wrappers he had at first.

We know that he has 57 wrappers now and he found 30 wrappers at the park. To find out how many wrappers he had at first, we need to subtract the number of wrappers he found from the number of wrappers he has now.

57 - 30 = 27

So, Danny had 27 wrappers at first.

Answer: {27}"
19,Paul got a box of 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 523 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?,"To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we need to compare the number of crayons he had left with the number of erasers he had initially. 

Paul had 523 crayons left and he started with 457 erasers. To find the difference, we subtract the number of crayons from the number of erasers: 457 - 523 = -66.

Since we can't have a negative number of crayons, we need to take the absolute value of the difference: |-66| = 66.

So, Paul had 66 more erasers than crayons left.

Answer: {66}"
20,Baker made 121 cakes. He sold 105 of them and bought 170 new cakes. How many cakes does baker still have?,"Baker initially made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them. To find out how many cakes he has left, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made: 121 - 105 = 16. 

Then, Baker bought 170 new cakes. To find out how many cakes he has in total now, we add the number of new cakes bought to the number of cakes he had left: 16 + 170 = 186.

The answer is {186}."
21,An industrial machine worked for 5 minutes. It can make 4 shirts a minute. How many shirts did machine make?,"The machine worked for 5 minutes and can make 4 shirts per minute.

5 minutes * 4 shirts/minute = 20 shirts

So, the machine made 20 shirts.

Answer: {20}"
22,"The bananas in Philip's collection are organized into groups of size 18. If there are a total of 180 bananas in Philip's banana collection, how many groups are there?","To find the number of groups of bananas, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the size of each group. 

The total number of bananas is 180, and each group has 18 bananas. 

So, the number of groups is 180 / 18 = 10.

The answer is {10}."
23,"There were some birds sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 5 birds on the fence now, how many birds had been sitting on the fence at the start?","There were some birds sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 5 birds on the fence now, we need to find out how many birds had been sitting on the fence at the start.

Let's say the number of birds that were sitting on the fence at the start is x. Then, when 4 more birds came to join them, the total number of birds became x + 4.

We are given that the total number of birds on the fence now is 5. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x + 4 - 4 = 5 - 4
x = 1

So, there was 1 bird sitting on the fence at the start.

Answer: {1}"
24,"Jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones. If there are 6 action figures on his shelf now, how many action figures did he remove from the shelf?","To find out how many action figures Jerry removed from the shelf, we need to first determine how many action figures were on the shelf before he added 4 more. 

Jerry initially had 3 action figures and added 4 more, making 3+4=7 action figures in total. However, he now has 6 action figures on the shelf. 

To find out how many action figures he removed, we need to subtract the current number of action figures from the total number of action figures before he removed some of the old ones. 

So, Jerry removed 7-6=1 action figure from the shelf.

The answer is {1}."
25,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps did danny find at the park?,"To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny found at the park, we need to know how many wrappers and bottle caps he found at the park in total.

Danny currently has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers. He initially had 5 bottle caps and 65 wrappers. To find the number of wrappers and bottle caps he found at the park, we subtract the initial amount from the current amount.

For bottle caps: 31 (current) - 5 (initial) = 26 bottle caps found at the park.
For wrappers: 9 (current) - 65 (initial) = -56 wrappers found at the park. However, this is incorrect as you can't have a negative number of wrappers. This means that Danny must have discarded some wrappers after finding them at the park.

Since we are looking for the difference between wrappers and bottle caps found at the park, we can ignore the discarded wrappers for now. We know that Danny has 26 bottle caps that he found at the park.

However, we can't directly compare the number of wrappers found at the park to the number of bottle caps. We need to find the total number of wrappers found at the park. Since Danny has 9 wrappers now and initially had 65 wrappers, the number of wrappers he found at the park is not directly calculable from the given information.

But we can calculate the difference between the number of wrappers he found at the park and the bottle caps he found at the park by first calculating the total number of wrappers he found at the park and then subtracting the number of bottle caps he found at the park.

Let's denote the total number of wrappers he found at the park as W. We know that he has 9 wrappers now and initially had 65 wrappers, so the total number of wrappers he has now is 9 + W.

We also know that the number of wrappers he has now is less than the number of wrappers he found at the park, so the total number of wrappers he has now is less than W. However, we can't directly calculate W from the given information.

We can calculate the difference between the total number of wrappers he has now and the number of bottle caps he found at the park. The total number of wrappers he has now is 9 + W, and the number of bottle caps he found at the park is 26.

However, we can't calculate the difference between the total number of wrappers he found at the park and the number of bottle caps he found at the park without knowing the total number of wrappers he found at the park.

But we can calculate the difference between the total number of wrappers he has now and the number of bottle caps he has now. The total number of wrappers he has now is 9 + W, and the number of bottle caps he has now is 31.

To find the difference between the total number of wrappers he has now and the number of bottle caps he has now, we need to know the total number of wrappers he has now. We can't calculate the total number of wrappers he has now without knowing the total number of wrappers he found at the park.

However, we can calculate the difference between the number of wrappers he has now and the number of bottle caps he has now. The number of wrappers he has now is 9, and the number of bottle caps he has now is 31.

To find the difference between the number of wrappers he has now and the number of bottle caps he has now, we subtract the number of wrappers he has now from the number of bottle caps he has now. 

The difference between the number of wrappers he has now and the number of bottle caps he has now is 31 - 9 = 22.

However, we are looking for the difference between the number of wrappers he found at the park and the number of bottle caps he found at the park.

We know that the number of wrappers he has now is 9, and the number of bottle caps he now is 31. We also know that the number of wrappers he initially had is 65, and the number of bottle caps he initially had is 5.

To find the number of wrappers he found at the park, we subtract the number of wrappers he now has from the number of wrappers he initially had. The number of wrappers he found at the park is 65 - 9 = 56.

To find the number of bottle caps he found at the park, we subtract the number of bottle caps he now has from the number of bottle caps he initially had. The number of bottle caps he found at the park is 31 - 5 = 26.

To find the difference between the number of wrappers he found at the park and the number of bottle caps he found at the park, we subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park from the number of wrappers he found at the park.

The difference between the number of wrappers he found at the park and the number of bottle caps he found at the park is 56 - 26 = 30.

The answer is {30}."
26,"Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate, how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?","To find the total number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we need to find the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and adding bacon, and then add the number of students who suggested both items to avoid double counting.

Let's start by finding the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes. We know that 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, but we don't know how many students suggested adding bacon. However, we do know that 38 students suggested adding bacon.

To find the total number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to find the number of students who suggested adding both bacon and mashed potatoes. Since we don't know this number, let's call it x. Then, the total number of students who suggested adding bacon is 38 + x.

The total number of students who participated in suggesting new food items is the sum of the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes, the number of students who suggested adding bacon, and the number of students who suggested both items. This can be represented as:

Total = 450 + (38 + x) + x

27,"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?","To find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate, we first need to determine how many of each item Matthew had left after giving some to his friends. 

Initially, Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, he must have given away the same number of each item. 

Let's assume he gave away x crackers and x cakes to each friend. Since he has 28 friends, he gave away a total of 28x crackers and 28x cakes.

We know that he had 13 crackers initially, so after giving away 28x crackers, he must have had 13 - 28x crackers left. However, we are not given any information about the number of crackers he had left, so we cannot determine the value of x from this equation.

Similarly, we know that he had 15 cakes initially, so after giving away 28x cakes, he must have had 15 - 28x cakes left. However, we are not given any information about the number of cakes he had left, so we cannot determine the value of x from this equation.

Since we cannot determine the value of x from the given information, we cannot determine how many crackers and cakes each person ate.

32,"There are some baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches. If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, how many baskets of peaches are there?","To find the number of baskets, we need to determine the total number of peaches in each basket and then divide the total number of peaches by that amount.

Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, so the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 3 = 7 peaches.

If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, and each basket has 7 peaches, then the number of baskets is 7 / 7 = 1.

However, this means that there is only 1 basket with 7 peaches. But the question asks for the number of baskets if there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets. This is a trick question because the question states that each basket has 7 peaches, which means that there is only 1 basket with 7 peaches.

However, if we assume that the question is asking for the number of baskets if there are a total of 7 peaches, and each basket has a different number of peaches, then we can say that the question is ambiguous.

But if we assume that the question is asking for the number of baskets if there are a total of 7 peaches, and each basket has 7 peaches, then the answer is 1.

However, the question asks for the number of baskets if there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, which means that there is only 1 basket with 7 peaches.

34,"Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon and some more in the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day, how many emails did Jack receive in the afternoon?","To find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon, we first need to know how many emails he received in the morning and the evening. We know that he received a total of 10 emails in the day, and 6 of them were in the morning. 

Let's denote the number of emails Jack received in the evening as x. Since he received 3 emails in the afternoon, the total number of emails he received is 6 (morning) + 3 (afternoon) + x (evening) = 10.

We can solve for x by subtracting 6 and 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 10 - 6 - 3.

x = 1.

So, Jack received 1 email in the evening. However, we are asked to find out how many emails he received in the afternoon, which is 3.

36,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?","To find the total number of visitors within 25 days, we need to add the number of visitors on the previous day to the number of visitors for each of the 25 days.

We know that 246 visitors came on the previous day, and 703 visitors came on the day before that. This means that the average number of visitors per day is (246 + 703) / 2 = 474.5.

Since we want to find the total number of visitors for 25 days, we can multiply the average number of visitors per day by 25:

474.5 * 25 = 11,862.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep the answer as a decimal for accuracy.

The total number of visitors within 25 days is approximately 11,862.5.

Answer: {11862.5}"
37,For Gwen's birthday she received 5 dollars from her dad. Her mom gave her 7 more dollars. If she spent 4 dollars.

Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and 7 dollars from her mom. 

So, the total amount of money she received from her mom is 7 dollars, and the total amount of money she received from her dad is 5 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the amount she received from her dad from the amount she received from her mom: 7 - 5 = 2

38,"There are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 47 groups and oranges are organized into 178 groups, how big is each group of oranges?","To find out how big each group of oranges is, we need to know the total number of oranges and the number of groups they are organized into. We are given the total number of oranges, which is 356. However, we are given the number of groups the bananas are organized into, not the oranges.

We are given the number of groups the bananas are organized into, which is 47, and the total number of bananas, which is 142. We can use this information to find out how many bananas are in each group. 

To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups they are organized into: 142 ÷ 47 = 3.02 (approximately). This means that each group of bananas contains approximately 3 bananas.

However, we are asked to find out how big each group of oranges is. We know the total number of oranges, which is 356, and the number of groups the bananas are organized into, which is 47. We are not given the number of groups the oranges are organized into, but we are given the number of groups the oranges are organized into in another part of the question, which is 178.

So, to find out how big each group of oranges is, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups they are organized into: 356 ÷ 178 = 2.

How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?,"To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park, we need to calculate the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park and the number he already had.

Danny found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. He already had 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection.

The number of wrappers he found at the park is 46, but he already had 52, so the total number of wrappers he has is 46 + 52 = 98.

The number of bottle caps he found at the park is 50, but he already had 21, so the total number of bottle caps he has is 50 + 21 = 71.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he has. The difference is 71 - 98 = -27.

However, since we are looking for how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found at the park, we need to consider the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park, not the total number he has. The number of bottle caps he found at the park is 50, and the number of wrappers he found at the park is 46.

The difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park is 50 - 46 = 4.

Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. 

David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 35 + 58 = 93 push-ups. 

David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches. 

Since we can't have a negative number of crunches, we'll assume that the question means David did 84 fewer crunches than Zachary, not 87.

If there are 8 action figures on his shelf now, how many action figures did he add to the shelf?","To find out how many action figures Jerry added to the shelf, we need to first determine how many action figures were on the shelf after he added some but before he removed 10 of the old ones.

Let's denote the number of action figures Jerry added as x.

Initially, Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf. After adding x action figures, he had 7 + x action figures on the shelf.

However, before we can determine the value of x, we need to know how many action figures were on the shelf before Jerry removed 10 of the old ones. We know that after removing 10 action figures, Jerry had 8 action figures left on the shelf.

So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x - 10 = 8

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 3 = 8

Adding 3 to both sides, we get: x = 11

Therefore, Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.

48,Julia played tag with 12 kids on monday. She played tag with 14 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days. How many kids did she play with altogether?,"To find out how many kids Julia played with altogether, we need to add the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday. However, we also need to consider the time she spent playing tag with each group of kids.

Let's assume that the time she spent playing tag with each kid is constant. We can use the total time she spent playing tag (34 hours) and the number of hours she spent playing tag with each group of kids to find out how many hours she spent playing tag with each kid.

Since we don't know the exact number of hours she spent playing tag with each kid, let's call it x. We can set up an equation to represent the total time she spent playing tag:

12x + 14x = 34

Combine like terms:

26x = 34

Divide both sides by 26:

x = 34/26
x = 1.31 hours

Now that we know the time she spent playing tag with each kid, we can find out how many kids she played with altogether. We can set up an equation to represent the total time she spent playing tag:

12x + 14x = 34

We already know that x = 1.31 hours. We can substitute this value into the equation:

12(1.31) + 14(1.31) = 34

Multiply the numbers:

15.72 + 18.18.34 = 34

Add the numbers:

34 = 34

The equation is true, so our assumption that x = 1.31 hours is correct.

Now that we know the time she spent playing tag with each kid, we can find out how many kids she played with altogether. We can divide the total time she spent playing tag (34 hours) by the time she spent playing tag with each kid (1.31 hours):

34/1.31 = 25.95

Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, we can round down to the nearest whole number:

25.95 ≈ 26

However, this is not the correct answer. We can try rounding up to the nearest whole number:

49,Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?,"To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we need to first determine how many cards she gave away. We know that she had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards initially, and now she has a total of 415 cards. 

Let's calculate the total number of cards she had initially: 
309 (baseball cards) + 356 (Ace cards) = 665 cards

Since she now has 415 cards, she must have given away 665 - 415 = 250 cards.

We know that she gave away some of her baseball cards and Ace cards. Let's say she gave away x baseball cards and (250 - x) Ace cards. We know that she now has 415 cards, so the number of baseball cards she has now is 309 - x, and the number of Ace cards she has now is 356 - (250 - x) = 106 + x.

We are given that she now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards in total, so we can set up the equation:
(309 - x) + (106 + x) = 415

Simplifying the equation, we get:
415 = 415

This equation is true for any value of x, but we know that x must be a non-negative integer (you can't give away a negative number of cards, and you can't give away a fraction of a card). 

However, we can use the fact that she now has 415 cards in total to find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards. Let's say she has y baseball cards and (415 - y) Ace cards. We know that she has 415 cards in total, so we can set up the equation:
y + (415 - y) = 415

Simplifying the equation, we get:
415 = 415

This equation is true for any value of y, but we know that y must be a non-negative integer. 

To find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards, we can try to find the values of y and (415 - y) that satisfy the equation. We know that she now has 415 cards in total, so we can try to find the values of y and (415 - y) that add up to 415.

Let's try to find the values of y and (415 - y) that add up to 415. We know that y must be a non-negative integer, so we can try different values of y to see if we can find a value of (415 - y) that adds up to 415.

After trying different values of y, we find that y = 309 and (415 - y) = 106 satisfy the equation. 

Therefore, Nell now has 309 baseball cards and 106 Ace cards. To find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards, we can subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:
309 - 106 = 203

So, Nell has 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

52,Emily is making bead necklaces for her 43 friends. She had 20 beads and she was able to make 5 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need?,"If Emily made 5 necklaces with 20 beads, and she has 43 friends, she needs to make 43 necklaces in total. To find out how many beads each necklace needs, we can divide the total number of beads by the total number of necklaces. 

However, we are given that she made 5 necklaces with 20 beads. So, we need to find out how many beads are needed per necklace for 43 necklaces. To do this, we first find out how many beads are needed per necklace for 5 necklaces. 

Since 20 beads are needed for 5 necklaces, we divide 20 by 5 to get 4 beads per necklace. Now, we can multiply the number of beads per necklace by the total number of necklaces (43) to find out the total number of beads needed. 

But, the question asks for how many beads each necklace needs, not the total number of beads. Since we already know that each necklace needs 4 beads for 5 necklaces, it will also need 4 beads for 43 necklaces. 

Therefore, each necklace needs 4 beads.

So, 29 bird families stayed behind.

Now, we need to find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind. To do this, we subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number of bird families that flew away:

60 - 29 = 31

Therefore, 31 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

The answer is {31}."
58,There were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. How many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now?,"To find out how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now, we need to first determine how many roses and orchids were cut from the vase. 

Initially, there were 9 roses and 6 orchids. After cutting some, there were 3 roses and 13 orchids left. 

So, the number of roses cut is 9 - 3 = 6, and the number of orchids cut is 6 - 3 = 3. 

Now, we need to find out how many roses and orchids are left in the vase. There are 3 roses and 13 orchids. 

To find out how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now, we subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids: 13 - 3 = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.

60,A waiter had 12 customers. While 15 customers left he got 14 new customers. How many customers does he still have?,"To find out how many customers the waiter still has, we need to calculate the number of customers who left and subtract that from the initial number of customers.

Initially, the waiter had 12 customers. While 15 customers left, but since there were only 12 customers, it means that the 15 customers who left is more than the number of customers the waiter had, so we will use the number of customers the waiter had which is 12.

Since 15 customers left, but we will use 12 customers as the number of customers who left because 15 is more than 12, we will use 12 customers as the number of customers who left. So, the number of customers who left is 12.

Now, we need to find out how many customers the waiter has left. To do this, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the initial number of customers. 

12 (initial customers) - 12 (customers who left) = 0

However, we also know that the waiter got 14 new customers. So, we need to add the number of new customers to the number of customers who left.

0 + 14 (new customers) = 14

Therefore, the waiter still has 14 customers.

61,Emily is making bead necklaces for her 72 friends. She has 6 beads and each necklace takes 3 beads. How many necklaces can Emily make?,"To find out how many necklaces Emily can make, we need to divide the total number of beads she has by the number of beads required for each necklace. 

Emily has 72 friends, but we don't know if she's making a necklace for each friend. However, the problem statement only mentions that she's making bead necklaces for her friends, so we can assume that she's making one necklace per friend. 

Since each necklace requires 3 beads, and Emily has 6 beads, we can divide 6 by 3 to find out how many necklaces she can make.

6 ÷ 3 = 2

However, this is not the correct approach, as the question states that Emily is making necklaces for her 72 friends. We need to consider the total number of beads required for 72 necklaces. Since each necklace requires 3 beads, the total number of beads required is:

72 friends * 3 beads per necklace = 216 beads

However, Emily only has 6 beads, which is less than the total number of beads required. We can divide the total number of beads required by the number of beads Emily has to find out how many necklaces she can make.

216 beads ÷ 6 beads = 36

But this is not the correct answer, because we are not given how many necklaces she can make if she had more beads. We are only given how many necklaces she can make with the 6 beads she has."

63,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, how many cups of flour did she put in?","To find out how many cups of flour Mary put in, we first need to determine the total number of cups of flour and sugar she needs. According to the recipe, she needs 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar.

Since she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let's say the number of cups of sugar she needs is x. Then, the number of cups of flour she needs is x + 2.

We know that the total number of cups of flour she needs is 11, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 11

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 9

This means that she needs 9 cups of sugar. Since she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, she needs 9 + 2 = 11 cups of flour in total.

Since she already put in some cups of flour, we can let the number of cups of flour she put in be y. Then, the number of cups of flour she still needs is 11 - y.

We are given that she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, which means that 11 - y = 9. Solving for y, we get:

y = 2

So, Mary put in 2 cups of flour."

80,36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus. So, the number of children left on the bus is 36 - 68 = -32. However, since the number of children cannot be negative, we can infer that the number of children who got on the bus is greater than 32.
3. After some children got on the bus, there were 12 children left on the bus.
4. To find the number of children who got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children left from the initial number of children who got off. However, since the number of children who got on the bus is greater than 32, we need to subtract 32 from the initial number of children who got off to find the minimum number of children who got on.
5. The number of children who got on the bus is at least 32 (to make the number of children left on the bus 12). To find the exact number, we need to set up an equation.

Let x be the number of children who got on the bus. Since there were 36 children initially and 68 children got off, the total number of children who left the bus is 36 + 68 = 104. The number of children left on the bus after some got on is 12, so we can set up the equation:

36 - 68 + x = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-32 + x = 12

Adding 32 to both sides, we get:

x = 44

However, this means that 44 children got on the bus, and the total number of children on the bus is 12. This is not possible since 44 + 12 = 56, which is less than the initial number of children who got off (68). Therefore, our initial assumption that 68 children got off the bus is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since there are 12 children left on the bus, and the bus initially had 36 children, the number of children who got off the bus is 36 - 12 = 24. The number of children who got on the bus is 68 - 24 = 44.

However, we still need to find the number of children who got off the bus minus the number of children who got on the bus. Since we know that 68 children got off the bus, but only 24 children actually left the bus, the difference is 68 - 24 = 44. But since we are looking for the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who got on, and we know that 44 children got on the bus, the number of children who got off the bus minus the number of children who got on the bus is 44 - 44 = 0."

88,Paco had 12 cookies. He ate 16 cookies and gave 21 of them to his friend. How many more cookies did he give to his friend than those he ate?,"To find out how many more cookies Paco gave to his friend than those he ate, we need to know how many cookies he had in total and how many he gave away. 

Paco initially had 12 cookies. He ate 16 cookies, but since he didn't have 16 cookies, he must have given some cookies to his friend before eating 16 cookies. Let's assume he gave x cookies to his friend before eating 16 cookies. Then, he had 12 - x cookies left.

However, we know that he gave 21 cookies to his friend in total. This means that x + (the cookies he gave after eating 16) = 21. Since he had 12 - x cookies left after giving x cookies to his friend, he must have eaten 16 from 12 - x cookies. This means that 12 - x - 16 = 0, because he can't eat more cookies than he has.

Solving the equation 12 - x - 16 = 0, we get x = 4. This means that he gave 4 cookies to his friend before eating 16 cookies.

Now, we know that he gave 4 cookies before eating 16 cookies and 21 cookies in total to his friend. This means that the number of cookies he gave after eating 16 cookies is 21 - 4 = 17.

The problem asks for how many more cookies he gave to his friend than those he ate. He gave 21 cookies to his friend and ate 16 cookies. Therefore, he gave 21 - 16 = 5 more cookies to his friend than those he ate.

Initially, there were 3 orchids in the vase. Now, there are 7 orchids in the vase. 

To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of orchids in the vase now from the number of orchids in the vase initially. 

So, the number of orchids Jessica cut is 3 - 7 = -4. However, since we cannot cut a negative number of orchids, this means that there must have been more orchids in the vase initially than we were told. 

Let's say there were x orchids initially. We know that x - 7 = 3 (since there were 3 orchids initially). Solving for x, we get x = 10. 

So, there were 10 orchids initially. Now, there are 7 orchids in the vase. To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of orchids in the vase now from the number of orchids in the vase initially.

If he had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially, how many cakes did each person eat?","To find out how many cakes each person ate, we need to first determine how many cakes Matthew gave to his friends in total. Since he had 8 cakes initially and we don't know how many he kept for himself, we'll assume he gave away all the cakes he had. 

However, we do know that he had 10 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 4 friends. This means he kept 10 crackers for himself. Since he had 10 crackers and an equal number of cakes, and we know he gave away all the cakes he had, we can assume that he gave away 8 cakes (since he didn't have any more crackers to give away).

Since he gave away an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends, we can divide the total number of cakes he gave away by the number of friends to find out how many cakes each person ate. 

8 cakes / 4 friends = 2 cakes per friend.

The answer is {2}."

159,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?,"To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we first need to find out how many students are in the school. Since there are 58 students in each classroom and there are 87 classrooms in total, we can multiply the number of students per classroom by the number of classrooms to get the total number of students.

Total number of students = 58 students/classroom * 87 classrooms
Total number of students = 5046 students

Since there are 2 seats on each school bus, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many buses are needed.

Number of buses = Total number of students / 2
Number of buses = 5046 students / 2
Number of buses = 2523

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 2523 buses, but since you can't have a fraction of a bus, we would need to round up to 2523 buses.

But, we can't have 2523 buses. We need to divide the number of students by the number of seats on each bus to get the correct number of buses.

Number of buses = Total number of students / 2
Number of buses = 5046 students / 2
Number of buses = 2523

We can be divided by 2 to get 1261.5. We can't have a fraction of a bus, so we need to round up to 1261.5."
160,Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need?,"To find out how many beads each necklace needed, we need to know the total number of beads used and the total number of necklaces made. We are given that Emily made 32 necklaces and she had 2 beads initially. However, we are not given the total number of beads used. 

Let's assume that the total number of beads used is 'x'. Since Emily had 2 beads initially and she used 'x' beads to make 32 necklaces, the total number of beads used is 'x + 2' (the 2 beads she had initially).

Since each necklace requires the same number of beads, the number of beads per necklace is the total number of beads used divided by the number of necklaces. So, the number of beads per necklace is (x + 2) / 32.

Unfortunately, we are not given the total number of beads used, so we cannot determine the exact number of beads per necklace."

162,Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. How many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?,"To find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies Paco ate, we need to first determine how many of each type of cookie he ate. 

Paco started with 40 sweet cookies and ate 15, so he has 40-15=25 sweet cookies left. 

He started with 25 salty cookies and ate 28, but since he can't eat more than he has, he must have eaten all 25 salty cookies and 3 more from another block of salty cookies. So, he ate a total of 25+3=28 salty cookies.

Now, we need to compare the number of salty cookies he ate (28) to the number of sweet cookies he ate (15). 

28 (salty cookies) - 15 (sweet cookies) = 13 

So, Paco ate 13 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to consider the changes in his collection. He found 63 new bottle caps and threw away 51 old ones. After these changes, he had 33 bottle caps left. 

Let's denote the initial number of bottle caps as x. After finding 63 new bottle caps, he had x + 63. After throwing away 51 old ones, he had (x + 63) - 51. Since he had 33 bottle caps left, we can set up the equation:

(x + 63) - 51 = 33

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation:

x + 63 - 51 = 33
x + 12 = 33

Now, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:

x = 33 - 12
x = 21

So, Danny had 21 bottle caps at first.

174,Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 5 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?,"To find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill, we need to first determine how many peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 5 peaches and he has 8 more peaches than Jill, we can set up an equation to find Jill's peaches.

Let J be the number of peaches Jill has. Then, Steven has J + 8 peaches. But we know Steven has 5 peaches, so we can set up the equation J + 8 = 5.

To solve for J, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation, which gives us J = -3. This means Jill has -3 peaches, but since we can't have a negative number of peaches, this is a problem with the given information.

However, let's continue with the given information. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 5 peaches. So, Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.

Since Jill has an unknown number of peaches, we can't directly compare Jake's peaches to Jill's. However, if we assume Jill has a positive number of peaches, we can say Jake has 2 more peaches than Jill.

202,Frank was reading through his favorite book. He read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. How many pages are there in the book?,"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the number of pages Frank read per day by the number of days it took him to finish the book.

Number of pages per day: 22
Number of days: 569

Total number of pages = Number of pages per day * Number of days
Total number of pages = 22 * 569

To calculate this, we can multiply 22 by 500 and then multiply 22 by 60, then add these two results together and multiply 22 by 9 and add that to the total.

First, multiply 22 by 500: 22 * 500 = 11000
Next, multiply 22 by 60: 22 * 60 = 1320
Add these two results together: 11000 + 1320 = 12320
Now, multiply 22 by 9: 22 * 9 = 198
Add this to the previous total: 12320 + 198 = 12518

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 12518.

203,"Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially, how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?","To find the number of bird families that stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the initial number of bird families. 

Number of bird families that flew away = 86
Initial number of bird families = 45

Number of bird families that stayed behind = Initial number - Number that flew away
= 45 - 86
= -41

However, since the number of bird families cannot be negative, it means that there are more bird families that flew away than initially present. To find the number of bird families that stayed behind, we need to calculate the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families (initial + flew away).

Total number of bird families = Initial + Flew away
= 45 + 86
= 131

Number of bird families that stayed behind = Total - Flew away
= 131 - 86
= 45

Now, to find the number of more bird families that flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind, we subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number that flew away.

Number of more bird families that flew away = Number that flew away - Number that stayed behind
= 86 - 45
= 41

Baker initially made 170 cakes. He sold 78 of them, so he had 170 - 78 = 92 cakes left. Then, he bought 31 new cakes. 

Now, we need to find out how many cakes he had in total after buying the new cakes. To do this, we add the number of cakes he had left to the number of new cakes he bought: 92 + 31 = 123 cakes.

So, the total number of cakes Baker sold is 170 (initial cakes) - 123 (cakes he had after buying new ones) = 47 cakes.

The number of cakes he bought is 31.

To find out how many more cakes he sold than those he bought, we subtract the number of cakes he bought from the number of cakes he sold: 47 (cakes sold) - 31 (cakes bought) = 16.

Number of pizzas = 17
Number of slices per pizza = 4

Total number of slices = Number of pizzas * Number of slices per pizza
Total number of slices = 17 * 4
Total number of slices = 68

Since there are 25 people, and each person will get at least one slice, we need to divide the total number of slices by 25 to find out if there are any leftovers.

Total number of slices / Number of people = 68 / 25
Total number of slices / Number of people = 2.72

Since we can't divide slices into fractions, we'll round down to 2 slices per person. This means that 25 people will get 2 slices each, and there will be some slices left over.

Number of slices left over = Total number of slices - (Number of people * 2)
Number of slices left over = 68 - (25 * 2)
Number of slices left over = 68 - 50
Number of slices left over = 18

So, there are 18 slices left over after everyone gets 2 slices each.

Now, we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made: 255 - 71 = 184.

Therefore, Baker made 184 more cakes than those he sold.

1. Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug initially.
2. Let's denote the number of marbles Doug has as x.
3. Since Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, Ed has x + 19 marbles initially.
4. Now, Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing some marbles.
5. This means that the difference between the number of marbles Ed and Doug have now is 8.
6. Since Ed initially had x + 19 marbles and now has 8 more than Doug, we can set up the equation: (x + 19) - x = 8
7. Simplifying the equation, we get 19 - x = 8
8. Solving for x, we get x = 11 (this is the number of marbles Doug has now)
9. Since Ed initially had 19 more marbles than Doug, Ed had 11 + 19 = 30 marbles initially.

How many more blocks did he use to build the house than he did to build the tower?,"To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than he did to build the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used to build the tower from the number of blocks he used to build the house.

Number of blocks used to build the house = 89
Number of blocks used to build the tower = 63

Difference in blocks used = 89 - 63 = 26

Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.

The answer is {26}."
263,Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. How many more balloons did Jake have than Allan in the park?,"To find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan, we need to compare the number of balloons each of them brought to the park. Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of balloons Allan brought from the number of balloons Jake brought: 3 (Jake's balloons) - 2 (Allan's balloons) = 1.

So, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.

The answer is {1}."
264,"Every day Ryan spends 7 hours on learning english, 2 hours on learning chinese and 4 hours on learning spanish. How many more hours does he spend on learning english than he does on learning spanish?","To find out how many more hours Ryan spends on learning English than he does on learning Spanish, we need to first find out how many hours he spends on each subject in total.

Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English every day. Since we are not given any information about the number of days, we will assume that we are looking for the daily difference.

Ryan spends 4 hours on learning Spanish every day.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of hours spent on Spanish from the number of hours spent on English: 7 - 4 = 3

So, Ryan spends 3 more hours on learning English than he does on learning Spanish.

The answer is {3}."
265,Robin has 43 packages of gum. There are 23 pieces in each package. Robin has 8 extra pieces of gum. How many pieces of gum does Robin have?,"To find the total number of pieces of gum Robin has, we need to first find the total number of pieces in the 43 packages. 

Since each package has 23 pieces, the total number of pieces in 43 packages is 43 * 23 = 989 pieces.

However, Robin has 8 extra pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 989 + 8 = 997 pieces.

The answer is {997}."
266,Paul had 108 books. After selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?,"To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to know how many books he had initially and how many books he had left after selling some and giving some away.

Paul initially had 108 books. After selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend, he had 62 books left.

So, the total number of books Paul gave away (either sold or gifted) is the difference between the initial number of books and the number of books left. 

Total books given away = Initial number of books - Number of books left
Total books given away = 108 - 62
Total books given away = 46

Since Paul gave 35 books to his friend, the number of books he sold in the garage sale is the difference between the total number of books given away and the number of books given to his friend.

Number of books sold = Total books given away - Number of books given to friend
Number of books sold = 46 - 35
Number of books sold = 11

The answer is {11}."
267,For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 17 small planks. If each large plank of wood needs 14 pieces of nails to be secured and each small plank needs 25 nails. How many planks does John need for the house wall?,"To find the total number of planks John needs for the house wall, we need to add the number of large planks and the number of small planks. 

Number of large planks = 12
Number of small planks = 17

Total number of planks = 12 + 17 = 29

However, the question asks for the number of planks John needs, not the total number of planks. Since we don't have any information about the number of planks John already has, we will assume that the question is asking for the total number of planks needed for the house wall.

So, the answer is {29}."
268,Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points scoring the same for each game. How many points did she score in each game?,"To find out how many points Melissa scored in each game, we need to divide the total number of points she scored by the number of games she played.

Melissa scored a total of 81 points in 3 games.

269,Nell collects cards. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?,"To find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has, we need to first determine how many cards of each type she gave to Jeff. 

Initially, Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she was left with 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards. 

Let's calculate the number of cards she gave to Jeff. 

For baseball cards: 246 (initial) - 404 (final) = -158 (this means she gave 158 more baseball cards than she initially had)
However, since we can't give more than we have, we can say she gave 404-246=158 baseball cards away.

For Ace cards: 495 (final) - 214 (initial) = 281 (this means she gave 281 more Ace cards than she initially had)
However, since we can't give more than we have, we can say she gave 495-214=281 Ace cards away.

Now we know Nell gave 158 baseball cards and 281 Ace cards to Jeff. 

To find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has now, we need to find out how many baseball cards and Ace cards she has now. 

Nell initially had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. She gave 158 baseball cards and 281 Ace cards to Jeff. 

The number of baseball cards she has now is: 246 - 158 = 88
The number of Ace cards she has now is: 214 - 281 = -67 
However, since we can't have a negative number of cards, we can say she has 214-281=-67 more Ace cards than she initially had, and 214 is the number of Ace cards she had initially.

The number of Ace cards she has now is: 214-281=-67 
However, since we can't have a negative number of cards, we can say she has 214-281=-67 more Ace cards than she initially had, and 214 is the number of Ace cards she had initially.

However, since we can't have a negative number of cards, we can say she has 214-281=-67 more Ace cards than she initially had, and 214 is the number of Ace cards she had initially.

Since she gave away 281 Ace cards, she had 214 Ace cards initially, and she has 495 Ace cards now, she must have received 495-214=281 Ace cards from Jeff, but that's the same number she gave away. 

Now we know that Nell gave 158 baseball cards and 281 Ace cards to Jeff, and she received 281 Ace cards from Jeff, which means she gave 281 Ace cards to Jeff and received 281 Ace cards from Jeff. 

This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption must be incorrect. 

The correct assumption is that she received some cards from Jeff, and the number of cards she received is the same as the number of cards she gave to Jeff. 

Let's assume that the number of cards she received is x. 

Then the number of cards she gave to Jeff is also x. 

The number of baseball cards she has now is: 246 - x
The number of Ace cards she has now is: 214 + x

We know that the number of baseball cards she has now is 404, and the number of Ace cards she has now is 495. 

So we can set up the following equations:

246 - x = 404
214 + x = 495

Solving these equations, we get:

x = -158
x = 281

However, since we can't have a negative number of cards, we can say she gave 158 baseball cards and 281 Ace cards to Jeff, but that's the same number she gave away.

The correct assumption is that she gave x baseball cards and x Ace cards to Jeff, and she received x Ace cards from Jeff, but that's the same number she gave away.

So we can say she gave x baseball cards and x Ace cards to Jeff, and she received x Ace cards from Jeff.

The number of baseball cards she has now is: 246 - x
The number of Ace cards she has now is: 214 + x

We know that the number of baseball cards she has now is 404, and the number of Ace cards she has now is 495. 

So we can set up the following equations:

246 - x = 404
214 + x = 495

Solving these equations, we get:

x = -158
x = 281

However, since we can't have a negative number of cards, we can say she gave 158 baseball cards and 281 Ace cards to Jeff, but that's the same number she gave away.

The correct assumption is that she received some cards from Jeff, and the number of cards she received is the same as the number of cards she gave to Jeff, but that"
270,Jerry had 8 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed 5 old ones. How many action figures were on his shelf in all?,"To find the total number of action figures on the shelf, we need to consider the changes Jerry made.

Initially, Jerry had 8 action figures.

He then added 4 more action figures, making it 8 + 4 = 12 action figures.

After that, he removed 5 old action figures, leaving him with 12 - 5 = 7 action figures.

So, the total number of action figures on the shelf is 7.

Answer: {5}"
272,"A mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 81 blocks. If there are 12 houses in each block, how many pieces of junk mail should he give in each block?","To determine the total number of junk mail pieces the mailman needs to give out, we first need to calculate the total number of houses. There are 81 blocks and 12 houses in each block, so the total number of houses is 81 * 12 = 972 houses. Since each house receives 4 pieces of junk mail, the total number of junk mail pieces is 972 * 4 = 3888. Therefore, the mailman should give 3888 pieces of junk mail in total.

However, the question asks how many pieces of junk mail he should give in each block, not the total number of pieces. Since there are 12 houses in each block, and each house receives 4 pieces of junk mail, the mailman should give 12 * 4 = 48 pieces of junk mail in each block.

The answer is {48}."
273,The ring toss game at the carnival made 325 dollars in the first 154 days and 114 dollars in the remaining 57 days. How much did they make per day in the remaining 57 days at the carnival?,"To find out how much the ring toss game made per day in the remaining 57 days, we first need to find out how much they made in total in the remaining 57 days. 

The total amount they made in the first 154 days was $325, and in the remaining 57 days was $114. To find the total amount made in the remaining 57 days, we can subtract the amount made in the first 154 days from the total amount made. However, we need the total amount made to do that. 

To find the total amount made, we add the amount made in the first 154 days to the amount made in the remaining 57 days. 

Total amount made = Amount made in the first 154 days + Amount made in the remaining 57 days
Total amount made = $325 + $114
Total amount made = $439

Now, we know that the total amount made in the remaining 57 days is $114. To find the amount made per day, we can divide the total amount made in the remaining 57 days by the number of days.

Amount made per day = Total amount made in the remaining 57 days / Number of days
Amount made per day = $114 / 57
Amount made per day = $2

The answer is {$2}."
274,"Brenda's mother made cookies for 10 guests but 9 guests did not come. If she prepared 18 cookies and each guest had the same number of cookies, how many did each of them have?","To find out how many cookies each guest had, we need to determine how many guests actually came to the party. Since 9 guests did not come, and there were originally 10 guests invited, only 1 guest came to the party.

Since Brenda's mother prepared 18 cookies and there was only 1 guest, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of guests to find out how many cookies each guest had.

18 cookies / 1 guest = 18 cookies per guest

However, this seems incorrect as it implies that the single guest received all 18 cookies. Let's re-examine the problem.

If 9 guests did not come, and there were originally 10 guests invited, only 1 guest came to the party. However, this is not possible as the problem states that Brenda's mother made cookies for 10 guests. Therefore, we can assume that the problem meant to say that 9 guests did not come to the party, but the remaining guests still received cookies.

Let's assume that x guests came to the party. Since 9 guests did not come, the number of guests who came is x = 10 - 9 = 1. However, this is still not possible as we cannot divide 18 cookies among 1 guest.

Let's re-examine the problem again. If 9 guests did not come, and there were originally 10 guests invited, the problem might be asking how many cookies each of the 10 guests would have received if all 10 guests came. In this case, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of guests to find out how many cookies each guest would have received.

18 cookies / 10 guests = 1.8 cookies per guest

However, this is still not possible as the problem implies that each guest received a whole number of cookies.

Let's re-examine the problem one more time. If 9 guests did not come, and there were originally 10 guests invited, the problem might be asking how many cookies each of the 9 guests who did not come would have received if they had come. In this case, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of guests who did not come to find out how many cookies each guest would have received.

18 cookies / 9 guests = 2 cookies per guest

This is a possible solution to the problem.

275,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar 7 cups of flour and 4 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how much flour and salt she still needs to add. 

The recipe calls for 7 cups of flour, and she has already put in 2 cups. So, she still needs 7-2 = 5 cups of flour.

The recipe calls for 4 cups of salt, and she hasn't added any yet. So, she still needs 4 cups of salt.

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of flour and salt she still needs to add. The difference is 5 (flour) - 4 (salt) = 1 cup.

So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of salt.

The answer is {1}."

Since the total number of students in the school is 111, we can assume that all students will be going on the trip. 

Next, we need to find out how many seats are available on each bus. We are given that there are 3 seats on each school bus.

Now, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus to find out how many buses are needed:

Total number of students = 111
Seats per bus = 3

Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Seats per bus
= 111 / 3
= 37

So, 37 buses are needed to take the trip.

286,Paul got a box of 589 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 571 crayons to his friends while he lost 161 crayons. How many more crayons did he give to his friends than those he lost?,"To find out how many more crayons Paul gave to his friends than those he lost, we first need to find out how many crayons he had left after giving some to his friends and losing some. 

Paul initially had 589 crayons. He gave 571 crayons to his friends, so he had 589 - 571 = 18 crayons left. Then, he lost 161 crayons. However, he only had 18 crayons left, so he couldn't have lost 161 crayons. This means that the number of crayons he lost is actually the difference between the number of crayons he had initially and the number of crayons he had left after giving some to his friends.

So, the number of crayons he lost is 589 - 18 = 571 crayons. However, this is the number of crayons he gave to his friends. To find out how many more crayons he gave to his friends than those he lost, we need to assume that he lost some crayons before giving any to his friends. Let's assume that he lost x crayons before giving any to his friends.

Then, he had 589 - x crayons left. He gave 571 crayons to his friends, so he had 589 - x - 571 = 18 - x crayons left. He lost 161 crayons, so we can set up with the equation: 18 - x = 161 - x + 161. Solving for x, we get x = 18 + 161 - 161 = 18.

So, he lost 18 crayons before giving any to his friends. Then, he had 589 - 18 = 571 crayons left, which he gave to his friends. To find out how many more crayons he gave to his friends than those he lost, we need to find out how many crayons he lost after giving some to his friends. We know that he lost 161 crayons in total, and he lost 18 crayons before giving any to his friends, so he lost 161 - 18 = 143 crayons after giving some to his friends.

So, he gave 571 crayons to his friends and lost 143 crayons. To find out how many more crayons he gave to his friends than those he lost, we subtract the number of crayons he lost from the number of crayons he gave to his friends: 571 - 143 = 428.

On the first day, there were 557 visitors, and on the second day, there were 188 visitors. The total number of visitors for these two days is 557 + 188 = 745.

We know that there are 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace, but this information is not relevant to the calculation of the total number of visitors.

To find the daily average for the remaining 55 days, we need to know the total number of visitors for the entire period. However, we are not given this information. Instead, we are given the number of visitors for the first two days and the number of paintings in the palace. We can assume that the number of visitors is not related to the number of paintings.

Since we cannot calculate the total number of visitors for the entire period, we can only calculate the total number of visitors for the first two days, which is 745.

Therefore, the total number of visitors within 57 days is 745.

307,"Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left, how many days did she drink for?","To determine how many days Debby drank the water bottles, we need to find out how many bottles she drank in total. We know that she bought 301 bottles and has 157 left. 

So, the total number of bottles she drank is 301 - 157 = 144 bottles.

Since Debby drank 144 bottles per day, the number of days she drank for is equal to the total number of bottles she drank, which is 144.

However, this answer doesn't make sense as the number of days should be greater than 1 since she drank 144 bottles per day. Therefore, we need to reevaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to divide the total number of bottles Debby drank (144) by the number of bottles she drank per day (144) is incorrect because it should be the number of bottles she has left divided by the number of bottles she drank per day.

The correct calculation is 157 / 144 = 1.093 (approximately), which is not the correct answer since she drank for a whole number of days. 

However, if we look at the problem again, we can see that the question asks for the number of days she drank for, given that she drank 144 bottles per day. This means we should divide the total number of bottles she has left (157) by the number of bottles she drank per day (144) and then round up to the nearest whole number of days.

157 / 144 = 1.093 (approximately), which means she drank for approximately 1.093 days. However, since you can't drink for a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number.

But this is still not correct, we should be dividing the total number of bottles she has left (157) by the number of bottles she drank per day (144) and then round up to the nearest whole number, but the number of days she drank for should be a whole number.

The correct approach is to find the number of days she drank for, given that she has 157 bottles left and she drank 144 bottles per day. 

Since 157 is greater than 144, she drank for more than one day. To find the number of days, we need to divide 157 by 144.

However, 157 is not evenly divisible by 144. 

To find the number of days she drank for, we can divide 157 by 144, which gives us 1.093 (approximately). This means she drank for approximately 1.093 days.

However, we should round up to the nearest whole number, since you can't drink for a fraction of a day. 

The correct answer is the number of days she drank for, which is the number of whole days she drank for, not the number of days she drank for approximately. 

Since 157 is not evenly divisible by 144, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 day.

However, we should also consider the remaining bottles. 

Since she drank 144 bottles per day, and she has 157 bottles left, we can subtract 144 from 157, which gives us 13 bottles.

This means that on the last day, she drank 13 bottles, not 144 bottles. 

Therefore, the correct answer is the number of days she drank for, which is the number of whole days she drank for, not the number of days she drank for approximately. 

The correct answer is the number of days she drank for, which is 1 day.

However, we should also consider the remaining bottles. 

Since she has 13 bottles left, we can assume that she will drink these 13 bottles on the next day. 

Therefore, the correct answer is the number of days she drank for, which is 2 days.

The answer is {2}."

We know that he has a total of 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals, making a total of 56 + 10 = 66 aquariums.

Since each aquarium has 39 animals in it, we can find the total number of animals by multiplying the total number of aquariums by the number of animals per aquarium. However, this problem only asks for the number of saltwater animals. So we need to find the total number of saltwater animals by multiplying the number of saltwater aquariums by the number of animals per aquarium.

Initially, Olivia had $100 in her wallet. She collected $148 from the ATM, so the total amount of money she had before visiting the supermarket is $100 + $148 = $248.

After visiting the supermarket, Olivia had $159 left. To find out how much she spent, we subtract the amount of money she had left from the total amount of money she had before visiting the supermarket:

$248 (total amount before supermarket) - $159 (amount left after supermarket) = $89

Therefore, Olivia spent $89.

346,The Razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?,"To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to first calculate the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts and jerseys.

The Razorback shop made $192 off each t-shirt and sold 157 t-shirts, so the total amount made from t-shirts is:
$192 * 157 = $30,064

The Razorback shop made $34 off each jersey and sold 19 jerseys, so the total amount made from jerseys is:
$34 * 19 = $646

Now, we need to find out the difference between the total amount made from t-shirts and jerseys:
$30,064 - $646 = $29,418

However, this is not the difference between the cost of a t-shirt and a jersey. To find that out, we need to divide the difference by the number of jerseys sold:

350,"After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died. If she had grown 3 trees initially, how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?","To find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we need to know the total number of trees that survived. Since Haley initially had 3 trees and 13 trees died, the number of trees that survived is 3 - 13 = -10. However, since we cannot have a negative number of trees that survived, it means that the initial number of trees must be less than 13. 

Given that 13 trees died, and the question asks for the difference between the number of trees that died and the number that survived, we can assume that the question is asking for the difference between the total number of trees (initial number of trees + number of trees that died) and the number of trees that survived.

However, since we do not know the total number of trees initially, we can assume that the question is asking for the difference between the number of trees that died and the number that survived in the context of the initial number of trees.

Let's assume that the initial number of trees is x. Then, the number of trees that died is 13, and the number of trees that survived is x - 13.

The question asks for the difference between the number of trees that died and the number that survived, which is 13 - (x - 13) = 26 - x.

However, since we are given that Haley initially had 3 trees, we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

26 - x to get 26 - 3 = 23.

355,Adam could fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room. His room has could hold 8 action figures. How many total shelves did his room have?,"To find the total number of shelves in Adam's room, we need to divide the total number of action figures that his room can hold by the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf.

Adam's room can hold 8 action figures in total, and each shelf can hold 10 action figures. 

To find the total number of shelves, we divide the total number of action figures (8) by the number of action figures per shelf (10). However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

8 ÷ 10 = 0.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 0. However, this is not possible because Adam's room can't hold 0 shelves. 

The problem statement says ""could hold 8 action figures."" This means that Adam's room can hold 8 action figures on one shelf. Therefore, the number of shelves is 1.

We know that Marco's strawberries now weigh 3 pounds, but we also know that he lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back. This means that initially, Marco had 3 + 9 = 12 pounds of strawberries.

Since Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 24 pounds in total, and we know that Marco initially had 12 pounds of strawberries, we can find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed by subtracting Marco's initial weight from the total weight.

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 24 - 12 = 12 pounds.

380,"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?","To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to first find out how many pages each chapter has. Since the book has 41 chapters and a total of 450 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find the number of pages per chapter.

Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 450 / 41
= 11 pages per chapter

Now that we know each chapter has 11 pages, we can find out how many pages Frank read per day. Since Frank took 30 days to finish the book, we can multiply the number of pages per chapter by the number of chapters to find the total number of pages, then divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the number of pages per day.

However, since we know the number of pages per chapter, we can simply multiply the number of pages per chapter by the number of chapters per day. 

Number of pages per day = Number of pages per chapter * Number of chapters per day
Since the total number of pages is 450 and Frank took 30 days, the number of chapters per day is 450/30 = 15 chapters per day. 
Therefore, the number of pages per day is 11 * 15 = 165 pages per day.

382,Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish each book. How many pages did he read per day?,"To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to know the total number of pages he read and the number of days it took him to read them. 

Since each book had 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish each book, we can multiply the number of pages per book by the number of days it took him to finish each book. 

However, the question doesn't specify how many books Frank read. Let's assume he read x books. The total number of pages he read would be 249x. 

The total number of days it took him to read x books would be 3x. 

To find the number of pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the total number of days: 

Pages per day = Total pages / Total days
= 249x / 3x
= 83

So, Frank read 83 pages per day.

The answer is {83}."

385,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of flour she still needs to add. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, and she has already put in 11 cups. Therefore, she still needs to add 14 - 11 = 3 cups of flour.

Since she still needs to add 3 cups of flour, and the question asks for the difference between the number of cups of sugar and the number of cups of flour, we need to compare the amount of sugar she needs (5 cups) to the amount of flour she still needs to add (3 cups). The difference between 5 cups of sugar and 3 cups of flour is 5 - 3 = 2 cups.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

386,Emily is making bead necklaces for her 44 friends. She made 26 necklaces and each necklace takes 2 beads. How many beads did Emily have?,"To determine how many beads Emily had, we need to calculate the total number of beads used in the necklaces. Since each necklace takes 2 beads and Emily made 26 necklaces, the total number of beads used is 26 x 2 = 52 beads. However, this is not the total number of beads Emily had initially. To find that, we need to know how many beads she had left after making the necklaces. Unfortunately, the information about the remaining beads is not provided in the question. Therefore, we can only calculate the total number of beads used in the necklaces.

However, if we assume that Emily had enough beads to make 26 necklaces, then the total number of beads used is 52. But without knowing the initial number of beads, we cannot determine the total number of beads Emily had.

However, if we consider that she has 44 friends and each necklace takes 2 beads, then the total number of beads she had is 44 x 2 = 88 beads. This is the total number of beads available for her friends, but it doesn't necessarily mean that she had 88 beads initially.

To accurately determine the total number of beads Emily had, we would need more information about the remaining beads or the initial number of beads."
387,Melissa scored a total of 21 points playing some games. Is she scored 7 points in each game. How many games did she play?,"To find out how many games Melissa played, we need to divide the total number of points she scored by the number of points she scored in each game.

If she drank 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles a day, how many days would the soda bottles last?","To determine how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to calculate how many soda bottles Debby has left after drinking 4 bottles a day.

First, let's calculate the total number of soda bottles Debby has:
256 soda bottles

Next, let's calculate how many soda bottles Debby drinks per day:
4 soda bottles

Now, let's calculate how many days the soda bottles would last:
Total number of soda bottles / Number of soda bottles per day
= 256 / 4
= 64 days

However, we need to calculate the number of days the soda bottles would last after Debby drank some, not the total number of days. So, we need to consider the number of soda bottles she drank.

Total number of soda bottles Debby drank = 4 * number of days she drank water bottles
= 4 * 312
= 1248 soda bottles

Now, let's calculate the number of soda bottles Debby has left:
Total number of soda bottles - Total number of soda bottles Debby drank

392,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to know how many bottle caps he has now and how many he found. We also need to consider the bottle caps he found, which are in addition to the ones he already had.

Danny currently has 42 bottle caps. He found 29 bottle caps at the park. To find out how many bottle caps he had at first, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he has now.

However, since the 29 bottle caps he found are in addition to the ones he already had, we need to add the ones he found to the ones he already had to get the total number of bottle caps he has now.

Let's say the number of bottle caps Danny had at first is x. Then, the total number of bottle caps he has now is x + 29 (the ones he found). We know this total is equal to 42.

x + 29 = 42

To find x, we need to subtract 29 from both sides of the equation.

x = 42 - 29
x = 13

Therefore, Danny had 13 bottle caps at first.

How much did ring toss game make per day?,"To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we need to first find out the total amount of money it made in 30 days. We know that the total amount earned by all games in 30 days is $420, and the total amount earned by all games including the ring toss game is $422.

So, the amount earned by the ring toss game alone in 30 days is $422 - $420 = $2.

To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we need to divide the total amount earned by the ring toss game in 30 days by 30.

Ring toss game's daily earnings = $2 / 30 = $0.0667

Paul has 116 books now, and he bought 38 new ones. To find out how many books he had before buying the new ones, we subtract 38 from 116:

116 - 38 = 78

So, Paul had 78 books before buying the new ones. This means that he sold 71 - 78 = -7 books. However, since you can't sell a negative number of books, this means that Paul actually bought more books than he had initially.

To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we need to find out how many books he bought in excess of the 71 he initially had. We can do this by subtracting 71 from the number of books he has now:

116 - 71 = 45

So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.

424,The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?,"To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the t-shirts at the discounted price and then subtract the total discount given.

First, let's find the selling price of each t-shirt after the discount:
Original price = $51
Discount = $8
Discounted price = $51 - $8 = $43

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 130 t-shirts at the discounted price:
Total revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Selling price per t-shirt
Total revenue = 130 x $43
Total revenue = $5,590

Since the shop sold the t-shirts at a discounted price, we need to subtract the total discount given to find the total revenue:
Total discount = Number of t-shirts sold x Discount per t-shirt
Total discount = 130 x $8
Total discount = $1,040

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
Total revenue = Total revenue - Total discount
Total revenue = $5,590 - $1,040
Total revenue = $4,550

The Razorback t-shirt shop made $4,550 from selling the t-shirts.

426,"Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends, how many cakes did each person eat?","To find out how many cakes each person ate, we first need to determine how many crackers and cakes Matthew gave to his friends in total. Since he gave equal numbers to each friend, we can assume he gave x crackers and x cakes to each friend.

Matthew had 29 crackers initially, and since he gave an equal number to each of his 2 friends, the total number of crackers given away is 2x. Therefore, the number of crackers left with Matthew is 29 - 2x.

However, since we don't know the exact number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends, we can't directly calculate the number of cakes he gave away. But we can find the total number of cakes given away.

Matthew had 30 cakes initially and gave an equal number to each of his 2 friends. Let's say he gave x cakes to each friend. The total number of cakes given away is 2x.

Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, the number of cakes given away (2x) must be equal to the number of crackers given away (2x). This means that the number of cakes given away is equal to the number of crackers given away.

To find the number of cakes each person ate, we need to find the value of x. Since the number of cakes given away is equal to the number of crackers given away, we can set up the equation:

2x = 2x (This equation is true for any value of x)

However, we can use the fact that Matthew had 29 crackers initially and gave an equal number to each of his 2 friends. This means that the total number of crackers given away is 2x, and the number of crackers left with Matthew is 29 - 2x.

Since we know that Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can set up the proportion:

29 - 2x = 30 - 2x

To solve for x, we can add 2x to both sides of the equation:

29 = 30

However, this equation is not true. The correct equation is:

29 - 2x = 30 - 2x

Subtracting 29 from both sides of the equation gives:

-2x = 1

Dividing both sides of the equation by -2 gives:

x = -1/2

However, x cannot be a fraction, as it represents the number of crackers or cakes given to each friend. Since x must be a whole number, we can try a different approach.

Let's assume that Matthew gave a whole number of crackers and cakes to each friend. Since he had 29 crackers initially, the number of crackers he gave to each friend must be a factor of 29.

The factors of 29 are 1 and 29. However, if Matthew gave 29 crackers to each friend, he would have given a total of 58 crackers, which is not equal to the number of cakes given away.

If Matthew gave 1 cracker to each friend, he would have given a total of 2 crackers, which is not equal to the number of cakes given away.

Since the number of crackers given away must be equal to the number of cakes given away, we can try a different approach.

Let's assume that Matthew gave a certain number of crackers to each friend, and the number of crackers given away is equal to the number of cakes given away. Since the number of crackers given away is a factor of 29, we can try different factors of 29.

The factors of 29 are 1 and 29. However, if Matthew gave 1 cracker to each friend, he would have given a total of 2 crackers, which is not equal to the number of cakes given away.

If Matthew gave 29 crackers to each friend, he would have given a total of 58 crackers, which is not equal to the number of cakes given away.

However, we can try a factor of 29 that is not 1 or 29. The factor of 29 is 29 itself and 1, but 29 is the only factor that can divide 29. The only other factor of 29 is 1, and 1 is not the number of crackers that Matthew gave to each friend.

However, we can use the fact that Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend. This means that the number of cakes given away is equal to the number of crackers given away.

Since the number of cakes given away is equal to the number of crackers given away, we can set up the proportion:

2x = 2x

However, we can use the fact that Matthew had 30 cakes initially and gave an equal number to each of his 2 friends. This means that the total number of cakes given away is 2x, and the number of cakes left with Matthew is 30 - 2x.

Since we know that Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each"

428,Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 555 pages equally distributed over 5 chapters. It took Frank 220 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?,"To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we first need to find out the total number of pages Frank read per day. Since he finished the book in 220 days, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to get the daily reading.

Total number of pages = 555
Number of days = 220

Daily reading = Total number of pages / Number of days
Daily reading = 555 / 220
Daily reading = 2.52 pages per day

Since the book is equally distributed over 5 chapters, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find out the number of pages in each chapter.

Number of chapters = 5
Total number of pages = 555

The original price of each pack is $107, and there is a discount of $106. So, the discounted price of each pack is $107 - $106 = $1.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of DVDs you can buy with $93. To do this, we can divide the total amount of money you have ($93) by the discounted price of each pack ($1).

Number of packs = Total amount of money / Discounted price per pack
= $93 / $1
= 93

So, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs with $93.

There are 8 different books and 10 different movies. You have read 19 books and watched 61 movies. 

The total number of books is 8 (different books) + 19 (books read) = 27 books. However, this is not the total number of books, since the question only asks for the difference between the number of movies and books. Therefore, we don't need to add the 8 different books to the 19 read books. The total number of books is 19.

The total number of movies is 10 (different movies) + 61 (movies watched) = 71 movies. However, this is not the total number of movies, since the question only asks for the difference between the number of movies and books. Therefore, we don't need to add the 10 different movies to the 61 watched movies. The total number of movies is 61.

After Doug lost some marbles, he was left with x - y marbles, where y is the number of marbles he lost.

Now, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, which means Ed has (x + 2) - (x - y) = 19 more marbles than Doug.

474,Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 612 pages equally distributed over 24 chapters. It took Frank 6 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?,"To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to find out how many pages are in each chapter. Since the book has 612 pages and 24 chapters, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find the number of pages per chapter.

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
Pages per chapter = 612 / 24
Pages per chapter = 25.5

Since the pages are equally distributed over the chapters, each chapter has 25.5 pages. However, we cannot have a fraction of a page, so we can assume that each chapter has either 25 or 26 pages (since 25.5 is closer to 25 than 26).

Now, let's assume each chapter has 25 pages. The total number of pages in the book would be:
Total pages = Number of chapters * Pages per chapter
Total pages = 24 * 25
Total pages = 600

Since this is less than the actual total number of pages (612), we can conclude that each chapter has more than 25 pages. Let's assume each chapter has 26 pages. The total number of pages in the book would be:
Total pages = Number of chapters * Pages per chapter
Total pages = 24 * 26
Total pages = 624

Since this is more than the actual total number of pages (612), we can conclude that each chapter has 25.5 pages is not possible and we need to find the closest whole number to 25.5 which is 26.

However, we know that the total number of pages is 612, so we can find the number of pages per chapter by dividing the total number of pages by the number of chapters.

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
Pages per chapter = 612 / 24
Pages per chapter = 25.5

We can round 25.5 to the nearest whole number which is 26.

Now that we know the number of pages per chapter (26), we can find the total number of pages in the book, which we already know is 612.

To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book.

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
Pages per day = 612 / 6
Pages per day = 102

The answer is {102}."

Each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches, so the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 6 = 10 peaches.

Since there are 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets, and each basket has 10 peaches, we can conclude that there is 1 basket of peaches.

The answer is {1}."

477,Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 54 of the old ones at the park while he found 48 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 52 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny throw away than those he found at the park?,"To find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park, we need to know how many bottle caps he had before throwing away the old ones. 

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had before throwing away the old ones as 'x'. After throwing away 54 old ones, he had x - 54 bottle caps. Then, he found 48 new ones, so the total number of bottle caps he has now is (x - 54) + 48 = x - 6.

We are given that Danny now has 52 bottle caps, so we can set up the equation: x - 6 = 52.

To solve for 'x', we add 6 to both sides of the equation: x = 52 + 6 = 58.

Now that we know Danny had 58 bottle caps before throwing away the old ones, we can find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than those he found at the park. He threw away 54 old ones and found 48 new ones, so the difference is 54 - 48 = 6.

How much did they jump altogether?,"To find the total distance jumped by the grasshopper and the frog, we need to know the distance jumped by the frog. Since the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, we can find the frog's distance by subtracting 4 from the grasshopper's distance.

The grasshopper jumped 35 inches. 
The frog jumped 35 - 4 = 31 inches.

Now, we can find the total distance by adding the grasshopper's distance and the frog's distance:
Total distance = 35 + 31 = 66 inches.

They made $67 off each t-shirt and sold 74 t-shirts, so the total amount made from t-shirts is 67 * 74 = $4962. 

They made $165 off each jersey and sold 156 jerseys, so the total amount made from jerseys is 165 * 156 = $25740. 

The total amount made from selling both t-shirts and jerseys is $4962 + $25740 = $30702. 

However, the question asks for the amount made from selling the jerseys only. Therefore, the answer is $25740.

Since Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, we can find Dean's height by subtracting 11 from Ron's height: 12 - 11 = 1 foot. However, the question is asking for the depth of the water, which is 5 times Ron's height. 

So, we multiply Ron's height by 5: 12 * 5 = 60 feet.

483,Paul got a box of 110 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 90 crayons to his friends while he lost 412 crayons. How many more crayons did he lose than those he gave to his friends?,"To find out how many more crayons Paul lost than those he gave to his friends, we need to first determine how many crayons he had left after giving some to his friends and losing some.

Initially, Paul had 110 crayons. He gave 90 crayons to his friends, so he was left with 110 - 90 = 20 crayons.

However, he lost 412 crayons. To find out how many crayons he lost in total, we need to subtract the number of crayons he had left from the initial number of crayons. But since he had given away 90 crayons, we need to add those back to the initial number of crayons to get the correct total number of crayons he had before losing any. 

So, the correct total number of crayons he had before losing any is 110 + 90 = 200 crayons.

Now, we can find out how many crayons he lost by subtracting the number of crayons he had left from the correct total number of crayons. 200 - 20 = 180 crayons.

However, we are asked to find out how many more crayons he lost than those he gave to his friends. Since he gave 90 crayons to his friends, we need to subtract 90 from the number of crayons he lost. 180 - 90 = 90.

486,"The Ferris wheel in paradise park has 6 seats. Each seat can hold 14 people. If there are 16 people on the wheel right now, how many more people can join the wheel?","To find the number of people that can join the wheel, we first need to find the total capacity of the wheel. Since there are 6 seats and each seat can hold 14 people, the total capacity is 6 x 14 = 84 people.

Since there are already 16 people on the wheel, we need to subtract this number from the total capacity to find out how many more people can join. 

84 - 16 = 68

Therefore, there are 68 more people that can join the wheel.

488,Robin has 21 packages of gum and 45 packages of candy. There are 9 pieces in each package. How many pieces of candies does Robin have?,"To find the total number of pieces of candy Robin has, we need to first find the total number of pieces of gum and candy combined. Since Robin has 21 packages of gum and 45 packages of candy, and each package contains 9 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

21 packages of gum * 9 pieces/package = 189 pieces of gum
45 packages of candy * 9 pieces/package = 405 pieces of candy
Total pieces = 189 + 405 = 594 pieces

Since we are only interested in the number of pieces of candy, we can ignore the number of pieces of gum. Therefore, Robin has 405 pieces of candy.

491,Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven who has 14 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 15 peaches. How many peaches does Jake have?,"To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to first determine how many peaches Jill has. We know that Steven has 15 peaches, and he has 14 more peaches than Jill. 

Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as x. Since Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill, we can write the equation: x + 14 = 15.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation: x + 14 - 14 = 15 - 14, which simplifies to x = 1.

Now that we know Jill has 1 peach, we can find out how many peaches Steven has. We already know that Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill, so we can add 14 to Jill's total: 1 + 14 = 15.

We are given that Steven has 15 peaches, which confirms our previous calculation. Now, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 15 peaches, we can subtract 7 from his total to find Jake's total: 15 - 7 = 8.

492,"Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week, how much money will have at the end of the harvest season?","To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his total rent payments.

Lewis earns $491 every week for 1181 weeks. 

Total earnings = weekly earnings * number of weeks
Total earnings = $491 * 1181
Total earnings = $580,331

Lewis pays $216 rent every week for 1181 weeks.

Total rent = weekly rent * number of weeks
Total rent = $216 * 1181
Total rent = $254,736

Now, let's subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season.

Total money = Total earnings - Total rent
Total money = $580,331 - $254,736
Total money = $325,595

496,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now?,"To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now, we need to first calculate the total number of bottle caps and wrappers he has now. 

Danny found 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers at the park, but he already had some in his collection. He now has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers. 

To find out how many bottle caps and wrappers he had in his collection initially, we subtract the number he found at the park from the number he has now:

Bottle caps: 28 (now) - 71 (found) = -43 (he didn't have enough, so this is incorrect) 
Wrappers: 16 (now) - 24 (found) = -8 (he didn't have enough, so this is incorrect)

However, since the problem states he has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers now, we know he must have had more than that in his collection initially. Let's try to find the initial number of bottle caps and wrappers he had in his collection.

Bottle caps: Let's say he had x bottle caps in his collection. Then, he found 71 and now has 28. So, x + 71 = 28. However, this is incorrect, so let's try to find the initial number of bottle caps he had in his collection.

Bottle caps: Let's say he had x bottle caps in his collection. Then, he found 71 and now has 28. So, x - 71 = -43. However, this is incorrect, so let's try to find the initial number of bottle caps he had in his collection.

Bottle caps: Let's say he had x bottle caps in his collection. Then, he found 71 and now has 28. So, x = 28 + 71 = 99.

Wrappers: Let's say he had x wrappers in his collection. Then, he found 24 and now has 16. So, x - 24 = 16. However, this is incorrect, so let's try to find the initial number of wrappers he had in his collection.

Wrappers: Let's say he had x wrappers in his collection. Then, he found 24 and now has 16. So, x - 24 = 16. However, this is incorrect, so let's try to find the initial number of wrappers he had in his collection.

Wrappers: Let's say he had x wrappers in his collection. Then, he found 24 and now has 16. So, x = 16 + 24 = 40.

Now that we know he had 99 bottle caps and 40 wrappers in his collection initially, we can find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers he has now.

Bottle caps: 28 (now) - 40 (initial) = -12 (he didn't have enough, so this is incorrect)
However, since the problem states he has 28 bottle caps now, we know he must have had more than that in his collection initially.

497,Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bar for $ 3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?,"To find out how much money Dan has left, we need to first determine how much he spent on the candy bars and then subtract that amount from the initial amount of money he had.

Dan bought 99 candy bars for $3 each. So, the total amount he spent is 99 x $3 = $297.

However, this is not possible since Dan only has $4. The problem here is that we need to find out how many candy bars Dan can actually buy with $4.

Since each candy bar costs $3, Dan can buy 1 candy bar with $4 (because 4/3 = 1.33, but he can't buy 1.33 candy bars). 

Since Dan can only buy 1 candy bar, the amount of money he spent is $3. The amount of money he has left is $4 - $3 = $1.

500,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, how many cups of flour did she put in?","To find out how many cups of flour Mary put in, we need to first determine how many cups of flour she still needs. Since the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour and she needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Mary has already put in x cups of flour. Since she needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, and the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, she needs 3 + 5 = 8 cups of flour in total.

We know that she already has x cups of flour, so she still needs 8 - x cups of flour.

We are also given that the total amount of flour she needs is 10 cups. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (8 - x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 = 10

This is a contradiction, as 8 is not equal to 10. However, this means that Mary must have already put in 2 cups of flour, since 10 - 8 = 2.

The number of visitors on the previous day was 191, and the day before that was 457. To find the number of visitors on each of the previous 245 days, we can assume that the number of visitors was the same as the day before that, which was 457. 

So, the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days is 457 * 245 = 112,105.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of visitors on that day (705) and the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days (112,105).

The difference is 112,105 - 705 = 111,400.

525,"Brenda's mother made cookies for guests. If she prepared 38 cookies and each of them had 19 cookies, how many guests did she prepare cookies for?","The question states that each cookie had 19 cookies, but this doesn't make sense in the context of baking. It's more likely that each cookie contained 19 cookies, but this is also not possible.

However, if we assume that the question meant to say that each cookie contained 19 pieces of a particular ingredient, such as chocolate chips, then the question is asking how many pieces of that ingredient are in total. 

In this case, the question is asking how many pieces of the ingredient are in 38 cookies, if each cookie contains 19 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of cookies by the number of pieces per cookie: 38 * 19 = 722.

However, the question asks how many guests Brenda's mother prepared cookies for, not how many pieces of an ingredient are in the cookies. Since each guest would likely receive one cookie, we can assume that the number of guests is equal to the number of cookies. Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 38 guests.

The answer is {38}."
526,"They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have some sets of tables, each having the 3 chairs. If there are a total of 9 chairs in the backyard, how many sets of tables do they have?","To find the number of sets of tables, we need to divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs per set. 

There are 9 chairs in total, and each set has 3 chairs.

Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, so the total number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon is 3 + 6 = 9.

Now, we subtract the number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the day: 10 - 9 = 1.

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the evening.

529,There are 65 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. How many peaches are in each basket?,"To find the total number of peaches in each basket, we need to find the total number of peaches in all the baskets and then divide it by the number of baskets. 

Since each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches, the total number of peaches in each basket is 7 + 3 = 10 peaches.

Now, we know that there are 65 baskets of peaches, and each basket has 10 peaches. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the number of baskets by the number of peaches in each basket: 65 * 10 = 650 peaches.

However, the question asks for the number of peaches in each basket, which we already know is 10. 

The answer is {10}."
530,"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 102 classrooms. There are 11 students in the school and 99 seats on each school bus. If 8 students do n't want to go for the trip, how many students are going on the trip?","To find out how many students are going on the trip, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. However, the problem already states that there are 11 students in the school. 

Since 8 students don't want to go for the trip, we need to subtract 8 from the total number of students to find out how many students are going on the trip.

Number of students going on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students not going on the trip
= 11 - 8
= 3

However, the problem also mentions that there are 99 seats on each school bus and 102 classrooms in the school. This information is not necessary to find out the number of students going on the trip.

So, the answer is {3}."
531,"Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. If she already has 16 square feet of carpet, how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?","To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs, we first need to calculate the total area of her room. The area of a rectangle (such as a room) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Length of the room = 11 feet
Width of the room = 15 feet

Total area of the room = Length x Width
Total area of the room = 11 x 15
Total area of the room = 165 square feet

Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, we need to subtract this from the total area to find out how much more carpet she needs.

Area of carpet needed = Total area of the room - Area of carpet already installed
Area of carpet needed = 165 - 16
Area of carpet needed = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 149 more square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

Answer: {149}"
532,Jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples than Steven. Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples. How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?,"To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we need to first determine how many peaches and apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples than Steven.

Steven has 17 peaches, so Jake has 17 - 6 = 11 peaches.
Steven has 16 apples, so Jake has 16 + 8 = 24 apples.

Now, let's compare the number of peaches and apples that Steven has. Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples. To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches: 17 - 16 = 1.

Therefore, Steven has 1 more peach than apple.

533,Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 60 of the old ones at the park while he found 58 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to consider the bottle caps he threw away and the new ones he found. 

Danny threw away 60 old bottle caps and found 58 new ones. This means he lost 60 - 58 = 2 bottle caps in the process.

However, we are given that Danny now has 67 bottle caps in his collection. To find out how many he had at first, we need to consider the 2 bottle caps he lost. Since he has 67 now, we can assume he had 67 + 2 = 69 bottle caps at first.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to subtract the 2 bottle caps he lost from the total number of bottle caps he had before he threw them away. This is because the 2 bottle caps he lost are the same bottle caps he threw away. 

So, let's subtract the 2 bottle caps he lost from the total number of bottle caps he had before he threw them away. The total number of bottle caps he had before he threw them away is 67 + 60 = 127. Now, we subtract the 2 bottle caps he lost from the total number of bottle caps he had before he threw them away. 127 - 2 = 125.

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to add the 58 bottle caps he found to the 125 caps he had before he threw them away. This is because the 58 bottle caps he found are new bottle caps he added to his collection. 

So, let's add the 58 bottle caps he found to the 125 bottle caps he had before he threw them away. 125 + 58 = 183.

The answer is {183}."
534,Nell collects baseball cards. She had 573 cards. She gave 195 cards to John and yet some more to Jeff. Now she has 210 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?,"To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we first need to determine how many cards she had after giving some to John. We know she had 573 cards initially and gave 195 cards to John. 

573 (initial cards) - 195 (cards given to John) = 378 cards left after giving some to John.

We also know that after giving some cards to Jeff, Nell was left with 210 cards. 

378 (cards left after giving to John) - 210 (cards left after giving to Jeff) = 168 cards given to Jeff.

536,Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?,"To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we need to consider the changes in the number of bird families. 

Initially, there were 49 bird families living near the mountain. Then, 59 bird families flew away for winter, leaving 49 - 59 = -10 bird families. However, this is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of bird families.

It seems there is a mistake in the given information. The correct information should be that 59 bird families flew away for winter, and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain. In this case, the number of bird families left near the mountain would be 49 - 59 + 24 = 14.

However, if we consider the correct information as 49 bird families living near the mountain, 59 bird families flew away for winter, and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain, then we can calculate the number of bird families left near the mountain as 49 - 59 + 24 = 14.

How many push-ups and crunches did Zachary do?,"To find out how many push-ups and crunches David did, we need to know how many push-ups and crunches Zachary did. We are given that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches.

We are also given that David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can calculate David's push-ups as follows:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 17
David's push-ups = 53 + 17
David's push-ups = 70

We are also given that David did 10 less crunches than Zachary, so we can calculate David's crunches as follows:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 10
David's crunches = 14 - 10
David's crunches = 4

Therefore, David did 70 push-ups and 4 crunches.

The answer is {70, 4}."

544,Danny collects bottle caps. He found 36 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?,"To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found at the park than those he threw away, we need to first determine how many bottle caps he had before going to the park. We know that after going to the park, he had 22 bottle caps in his collection and he threw away 35 old ones. 

Since he threw away 35 old ones and then had 22 in his collection, he must have found some bottle caps at the park to replace the ones he threw away. To find out how many, we subtract the number of bottle caps he had after going to the park (22) from the number of bottle caps he threw away (35). This gives us 35 - 22 = 13. However, this is the number of bottle caps he replaced by throwing away old ones, not the number he found at the park. 

We are told he found 36 bottle caps at the park. To find out how many more he found than he threw away, we need to subtract the number he threw away (35) from the number he found (36). This gives us 36 - 35 = 1.

The answer is {1}."
545,Dan has $ 4. For a total of $ 3 he bought 10 candy bar each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?,"To find out how much money is left, we first need to determine the cost of each candy bar. Dan spent $3 on 10 candy bars, so we can find the cost of each candy bar by dividing the total amount spent ($3) by the number of candy bars (10).

Cost per candy bar = Total amount spent / Number of candy bars
Cost per candy bar = $3 / 10
Cost per candy bar = $0.30

Now that we know the cost of each candy bar, we can find out how much money Dan spent in total by multiplying the cost per candy bar by the number of candy bars:

Total amount spent = Cost per candy bar * Number of candy bars
Total amount spent = $0.30 * 10
Total amount spent = $3

Since Dan spent $3 and he had $4 initially, we can find out how much money is left by subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount:

Money left = Initial amount - Total amount spent
Money left = $4 - $3
Money left = $1

The answer is {$1}."
546,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of each ingredient are left.

The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, and Mary hasn't added any yet, so she still needs 6 cups of sugar.

The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, but Mary has already added 2 cups, so she still needs 9 - 2 = 7 cups of flour.

Now, we need to compare the number of cups of flour and sugar Mary needs to add. She needs 7 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.

To find out how many more cups of flour than sugar she needs, we subtract the number of cups of sugar from the number of cups of flour: 7 - 6 = 1.

Therefore, Mary needs 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.

553,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"To determine how many bottle caps Danny had initially, we need to consider the information provided. Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park and now has 28 bottle caps in his collection. This means that he must have had some bottle caps before going to the park.

Let's calculate the number of bottle caps Danny had before going to the park. Since he found 22 bottle caps and now has 28, the additional bottle caps he collected from somewhere else must be 28-22=6.

However, we are not given any information about where these additional 6 bottle caps came from. Therefore, we cannot determine how many bottle caps Danny had initially.

But we can find out how many bottle caps Danny had initially if we assume that the 6 additional bottle caps came from his wrappers. We know that Danny found 8 wrappers at the park and now has 63 wrappers in his collection. This means that he must have had 63-8=55 wrappers before going to the park.

If we assume that the 6 additional bottle caps came from his wrappers, we can calculate the number of bottle caps Danny had initially. We know that Danny had 55 wrappers and that each wrapper corresponds to 6 bottle caps. Therefore, the number of bottle caps Danny had initially is 55*6=330.

However, this is an assumption and we cannot be certain that the 6 additional bottle caps came from his wrappers.

So, the answer is {330}."

562,"In a school there are 635 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 510 more boys than girls, how many boys are there in that school?","To find the number of boys in the school, we first need to find the total number of students. Since there are 510 more boys than girls, we can represent the number of boys as x and the number of girls as x - 510.

We know that the number of girls is 635, so we can set up the equation:

x - 510 = 635

To solve for x, we add 510 to both sides:

x = 635 + 510
x = 1145

Now that we know the number of boys is 1145, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = 1145 (boys) + 635 (girls)
Total number of students = 1780

If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total, how many bags of cookies do you have?","To find out how many bags of cookies you have, let's start by using the information that you have 14 bags in total. Since each bag has an equal number of cookies, we can represent the number of cookies in each bag as 'x'. 

The total number of cookies is 28, and the total number of bags is 14. So, the total number of cookies can be represented as 14x = 28.

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 14. 

x = 28 / 14
x = 2

This means that each bag has 2 cookies. Now, we know that the total number of cookies is 28, and each bag has 2 cookies. So, the number of bags of cookies can be found by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag.

Number of bags of cookies = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag
= 28 / 2
= 14

573,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?,"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to calculate the total number of seats in the buses and then determine if that number is a multiple of the number of classrooms.

First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the buses:
95 buses * 118 seats per bus = 11,220 seats

Since each classroom likely has more than one student, we can assume that the total number of seats in the buses is a multiple of the number of classrooms. However, we need to check if the number of seats is a multiple of the number of classrooms.

To do this, we can divide the total number of seats by the number of classrooms:
11,220 seats / 84 classrooms = 133.57

Since the result is not a whole number, it's unlikely that the total number of seats is a multiple of the number of classrooms. However, we can round down to the nearest whole number to get an estimate:
11,220 seats / 84 classrooms = 133 seats per classroom

Now, let's multiply the number of classrooms by the estimated number of seats per classroom:
84 classrooms * 133 seats per classroom = 11,172 students

Therefore, the estimated number of students in the school is 11,172.

How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?,"To find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys and t-shirts, and then find the difference between the two.

The Razorback shop sold 113 t-shirts at $25 each, so the total revenue from t-shirts is:
113 x $25 = $2,825

The Razorback shop sold 78 jerseys at $115 each, so the total revenue from jerseys is:
78 x $115 = $8,970

Now, let's find the difference between the revenue from jerseys and t-shirts:
$8,970 - $2,825 = $6,145

Since the difference in revenue is due to the difference in price, we can find the difference in price by dividing the difference in revenue by the number of t-shirts sold:
$6,145 ÷ 113 = $54.45

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. The question asks how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. So, we need to find the difference in price, not revenue. Since the price of a t-shirt is $25 and the price of a jersey is $115, the difference in price is:
$115 - $25 = $90

Therefore, a jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.

First, let's find the difference: 126 (cakes) - 48 (pastries) = 78. However, this is the difference before selling any items. Since Baker sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries, we should consider the items sold as well.

The difference between the number of cakes sold and pastries sold is: 115 (cakes) - 81 (pastries) = 34.

However, since Baker made more items than he sold, we need to consider the difference between the total items made and the total items sold. 

Let's find the difference between the total items made and the total items sold: 126 (cakes) + 48 (pastries) = 174 (total items made), and 115 (cakes) + 81 (pastries) = 196 (total items sold).

Since Baker sold more items than he made, it's not possible to make more items than sold, we should consider the difference between the items made and sold: 174 (items made) - 196 (items sold) = -22.

However, we are asked to find how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, not how many items were made or sold. Since Baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries, we can directly find the difference: 126 -22 is incorrect since we are looking for how many more cakes than pastries were made, so let's find the difference between the items made: 126 (cakes) - 48 (pastries) = 78.

The answer is {78}."
608,"At the arcade Dave had won 19 tickets.

Dave used 12 tickets to buy some toys and 7 tickets to buy some clothes.

609,"A grocery store had 30 bottles of regular soda, 8 bottles of diet soda and 41 apples. How many bottles did they have total?","To find the total number of bottles the grocery store had, we need to add the number of bottles of regular soda and diet soda. 

The number of bottles of regular soda is 30, and the number of bottles of diet soda is 8. 

So, the total number of bottles of soda is 30 + 8 = 38.

Adding the number of apples, which is 41, to the total number of bottles of soda gives us the total number of bottles the grocery store had. 

Therefore, the total number of bottles is 38 + 41 = 79.

The answer is {79}."

There are 11 baskets, and each basket has 10 red peaches. So, the total number of red peaches is 11 x 10 = 110.

There are 11 baskets, and each basket has 18 green peaches. So, the total number of green peaches is 11 x 18 = 198.

Now, we add the total number of red peaches and the total number of green peaches to find the total number of peaches in the baskets: 110 + 198 = 308.

617,Katie had 57 new games and 39 old games. Her friends had 34 new games. How many more games does Katie have than her friends?,"To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to calculate the total number of games Katie has and subtract the total number of games her friends have.

Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 57 + 39 = 96 games.

Her friends have 34 new games, but we don't know if they have any old games. However, since the question only asks for the difference in the number of games, we don't need to know the number of old games her friends have.

So, to find the difference, we subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 96 - 34 = 62.

Therefore, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.

How much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?,"To find out how much more money Gwen received from her dad than from her mom, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she received from both her parents. Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and 2 dollars from her mom, so the total amount she received is 5 + 2 = 7 dollars.

However, we are also given that Gwen spent 6 dollars. To find out how much money she had left, we subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she received: 7 - 6 = 1 dollar.

Since Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and 2 dollars from her mom, and we know that she had 1 dollar left after spending 6 dollars, we can conclude that the difference in the amount she received from her dad and her mom is 5 - 2 = 3 dollars.

Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, and now he has $6. 

Let's start by finding out how much he spent on the books. We already know that he spent $16.

To find out how much each book cost, we can divide the total amount spent by the number of books: $16 / 92 books = $0.174 per book (approximately).

However, we are not asked to find the cost of each book. We are asked to find out how much Edward had before he spent his money.

If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that, how many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?","To find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace before that day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous three days from the total number of visitors before those days. 

Let's denote the total number of visitors before those days as x. We know that x - 419 - 103 - 92 = x - 614.

However, we don't have information about the total number of visitors before those days. We only know that 92 visitors came the day before, 103 visitors the day before that, and 419 visitors the day before that.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate the total number of visitors before those days, we can't determine the exact number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace before that day.

Therefore, we can't provide a final answer in the required format."
647,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 100 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 666 visitors on that day, how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?","To find the number of more visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on that day.

Number of visitors on that day = 666
Number of visitors on the previous day = 100

Number of more visitors = 666 - 100 = 566

648,"In Haley's class 4 are boys who love to play marbles. If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 marbles for herself, how many will each of the boys receive?","To find out how many marbles each of the boys will receive, we first need to determine how many marbles are left after Haley keeps her share. Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, so she will give the remaining marbles to the boys.

The number of marbles left for the boys is 23 - 15 = 8.

There are 4 boys who love to play marbles, and they will share the remaining 8 marbles equally. To find out how many marbles each boy will receive, we divide the total number of marbles left (8) by the number of boys (4).

8 ÷ 4 = 2

Therefore, each of the boys will receive 2 marbles.

How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of flour and sugar she still needs to add. 

The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, and she has already put in 4 cups. Therefore, she still needs 9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour.

The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, and we don't know how much she has already added. However, since we are asked to compare the amount of sugar to the amount of flour, we can calculate the difference in the amount of flour she still needs to add, which is 5 cups.

So, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour she needs to add, we can simply compare the amount of sugar to the amount of flour she still needs to add. Since she still needs to add 5 cups of flour, and we don't know how much sugar she needs to add, we can say that she needs to add 5 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

675,Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?,"To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we first need to find out how many pages he read per day. Since the book has 193 pages and it took him 660 days to finish, we can divide the total number of pages by the total number of days to find the number of pages he read per day.

Pages read per day = Total pages / Total days
Pages read per day = 193 pages / 660 days
Pages read per day = 0.293 (approximately)

Since the pages are equally distributed over 15 chapters, we can assume that Frank read approximately the same number of chapters per day. To find the number of chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of pages he read per day by the number of pages per chapter.

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Total chapters
Pages per chapter = 193 pages / 15 chapters
Pages per chapter = 12.933 (approximately)

Now, we can divide the number of pages he read per day by the number of pages per chapter to find the number of chapters he read per day.

Chapters read per day = Pages read per day / Pages per chapter
Chapters read per day = 0.293 / 12.933
Chapters read per day ≈ 0.0226

Since we cannot read a fraction of a chapter, we can round down to the nearest whole number to find the approximate number of chapters Frank read per day.

Chapters read per day ≈ 0 (approximately)
However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to re-evaluate the problem and consider the fact that the pages are equally distributed over 15 chapters. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem: 
Since the book has 193 pages and it took Frank 660 days to finish, we can divide the total number of pages by the total number of days to find the number of pages he read per day.

Pages read per day = Total pages / Total days
Pages read per day = 193 pages / 660 days
Pages read per day = 0.293 (approximately)

Since the pages are equally distributed over 15 chapters, we can assume that Frank read 1 chapter per day, and the number of pages he read per day would be approximately equal to the number of pages per chapter.

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Total chapters
Pages per chapter = 193 pages / 15 chapters
Pages per chapter = 12.933 (approximately)

Now, we can divide the number of pages he read per day by the number of pages per chapter to find the number of chapters he read per day.

Chapters read per day = Pages read per day / Pages per chapter
Chapters read per day = 0.293 / 12.933
Chapters read per day ≈ 0.0226

However, we are told that the pages are equally distributed over 15 chapters. This means that Frank read 1 chapter per day."
676,"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?","To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to first determine how far the frog jumped compared to the grasshopper and the mouse.

We know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches and that it jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. This means the frog jumped 19 - 4 = 15 inches.

We also know that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. Since the frog jumped 15 inches, the mouse jumped 15 - 44 = -29 inches. However, since distance cannot be negative, this means the mouse actually jumped 44 inches, but in the opposite direction of the frog and grasshopper.

The frog jumped 15 inches.

677,"Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 18 bird families living near the mountain. If 38 bird families flew away to africa and 80 bird families flew away to asia, how many bird families flew away for the winter?","To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we need to add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number that flew to Asia. 

First, let's add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and Asia. 
Bird families that flew to Africa = 38
Bird families that flew to Asia = 80
Total bird families that flew away = 38 + 80 = 118

However, the question asks for the number of bird families that flew away for the winter from the mountain. We are given that there are 18 bird families living near the mountain. Since 118 bird families flew away in total, we need to subtract the number of bird families that were already living near the mountain to find out how many actually flew away from the mountain.

Bird families that flew away from the mountain = Total bird families that flew away - Bird families living near the mountain
= 118 - 18
= 100

678,Matthew had 23 crackers. He has 11 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends. How many crackers did each friend eat?,"To find out how many crackers each friend ate, we need to first determine how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. Since he had 23 crackers initially and has 11 left, he must have given away 23 - 11 = 12 crackers.

Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 2 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers given away (12) by the number of friends (2) to find out how many each friend ate.

12 / 2 = 6

So each friend ate 6 crackers.

The answer is {6}."

Then, Rachel picked 2 apples, which means the number of apples decreased by 2. After that, 3 new apples grew on the tree.

So, let's calculate the current number of apples:

1. Initial number of apples: 4
2. Number of apples picked: 2
3. Number of apples left after picking: 4 - 2 = 2
4. Number of new apples grown: 3
5. Current number of apples: 2 + 3 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 apples on Rachel's tree now.

During the Arkansas game, they sold 47 t-shirts, and each t-shirt makes $87. So, the amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas game is:
47 * 87 = 4087 dollars

They sold a total of 95 t-shirts, and 47 of them were sold during the Arkansas game. So, the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game is:
95 - 47 = 48 t-shirts

The amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is:
48 * 87 = 4176 dollars

The total amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts is the sum of the money made during the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game:
4087 + 4176 = 8263 dollars

The answer is {8263}."

688,"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 21 classrooms. There are 98 students in the school and 7 school buses. If all buses are full, how many seats are in each bus?","To find the number of seats in each bus, we need to first determine the total number of students going on the field trip. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of students going on the field trip. It only mentions the total number of students in the school, which is 98. 

Assuming all students are going on the field trip, we can proceed with the calculation. 

There are 7 school buses, and if all buses are full, we need to divide the total number of students (98) by the number of buses (7) to find the number of seats in each bus.

98 students / 7 buses = 14 students per bus

Since each student occupies one seat, the number of seats in each bus is also 14.

691,The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?,"To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts and jerseys, then find the difference between the revenue from jerseys and t-shirts.

The Razorback shop sold 254 t-shirts at $86 each, so the total revenue from t-shirts is:
254 * 86 = 21,864

The Razorback shop sold 43 jerseys at $232 each, so the total revenue from jerseys is:
43 * 232 = 9,976

To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to find the difference between the revenue from jerseys and t-shirts:
9,976 - 21,864 = -11,888

However, the question asks how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, not how much less a jersey costs than a t-shirt. To find the correct answer, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:

692,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?,"To determine how many wrappers Danny had at first, we need to know how many wrappers he has now and how many wrappers he found. He has 68 wrappers now and found 66 wrappers at the park. 

Since we don't know how many wrappers he had initially, let's denote the number of wrappers he had initially as 'x'. Now, we know that the total number of wrappers he has is the sum of the wrappers he found and the wrappers he already had. So, we can write an equation: x + 66 = 68.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 66 from both sides of the equation. 

x + 66 - 66 = 68 - 66
x = 2

So, Danny had 2 wrappers initially.

However, the problem doesn't directly state the total number of groups. Instead, it gives us the number of eggs per group (2) and the total number of eggs per group (11). We can use this information to find the total number of groups, then multiply that by the number of eggs per group.

Since each group has 2 eggs and there are 11 eggs in each group, we can set up an equation to find the total number of groups:

2 eggs/group * x groups = 11 eggs/group

However, the problem is not consistent in its wording. It initially states that each group has 2 eggs, but later states that each group has 11 eggs. Given this inconsistency, we can't accurately determine the total number of eggs Rebecca has based on the provided information.

If we assume the problem is asking for the total number of eggs in each group (based on the statement ""each group has 2 eggs""), then the answer would be 2 eggs.

But if we assume the problem is asking for the total number of groups (based on the statement ""each group has 11 eggs""), then we would need to know the total number of eggs to find the number of groups.

Since we can't accurately determine the total number of eggs based on the provided information, we can't provide a definitive answer to this question.

However, if we must provide an answer, we can choose the option that is most consistent with the information provided.

If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes, how many students suggested bacon?","To find the number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to first find the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes, and then add 166 to that number.

Let's denote the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes as x. We know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes, so the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.

We also know that the total number of students who suggested adding either mashed potatoes or bacon is 182. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 166) = 182

Combine like terms:

2x + 166 = 182

Subtract 166 from both sides:

2x = 16

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 8

Now that we know the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes (x = 8), we can find the number of students who suggested adding bacon by adding 166:

Number of students who suggested adding bacon = x + 166
= 8 + 166

After some left, he got 4 new customers. However, he still had 9 customers. This means that the 4 new customers replaced some of the customers who left. So, the number of customers who left can be found by subtracting the number of customers he still had (9) from the number of customers he had before the new ones arrived (13). 

However, since the 4 new customers are added to the remaining 9 customers, the number of customers he had before the new ones arrived can be found by adding the 4 new customers to the 9 customers he still had, which gives 13. So the initial number of customers is 13.

The number of customers who left is the initial number of customers minus the number of customers he still had. Therefore, the number of customers who left is 13-9 = 4.

We are given that there are 10 action figures on the shelf now. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x - 7) + 2 = 10

To solve for x, we first simplify the equation:

x - 7 + 2 = 10
x - 5 = 10

Now, we add 5 to both sides:

x = 15

So, Jerry had 15 action figures initially on the shelf.

730,"Paul had 21 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones. If he has 15 books now, how many more books did he sell than he bought?","To find out how many more books Paul sold than he bought, we need to know how many books he sold and how many he bought. 

Initially, Paul had 21 books. After selling some, he bought 42 new ones. Now, he has 15 books. 

Let's first find out how many books Paul had after selling some. Since he bought 42 new ones and now has 15, the number of books he had after selling some is 15 - 42 = -27. However, this is not possible because you can't have a negative number of books. 

So, let's re-evaluate the situation. If Paul had 21 books initially and now has 15, he must have sold 21 - 15 = 6 books. 

However, the question asks how many more books he sold than he bought. We know that he bought 42 new ones, but we don't know how many he sold. We only know that he sold 6 books. 

To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we need to know how many books he sold in total. Let's call the total number of books he sold 'x'. Then, the number of books he bought is 42, and the number of books he has now is 15. 

We can set up the equation: 21 - x + 42 = 15. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 63 - x = 15. 

Subtracting 63 from both sides, we get: -x = -48. 

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: x = 48. 

So, Paul sold 48 books in total. 

To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we subtract the number of books he bought from the number of books he sold: 48 - 42 = 6. 

However, this is not the correct answer. We know that Paul sold 6 books, and we are asked how many more books he sold than he bought.

734,"A mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block, how many houses are there in a block?","To find out how many houses are in a block, we need to first determine how many pieces of junk mail are given to each house. Since the mailman gives 8 pieces of junk mail to each house and there are 32 pieces in total for each block, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces given to each house.

However, the correct approach would be to divide the total number of junk mails in a block by the number of junk mails given to each house. 

Total junk mails in a block = 32
Junk mails given to each house = 8
Number of houses in a block = Total junk mails in a block / Junk mails given to each house
Number of houses in a block = 32 / 8
Number of houses in a block = 4

We know that a total of 35 bird families flew away to Asia and 62 bird families flew away to Africa. 

To find out how many more bird families flew away to Africa, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the number of bird families that flew away to Africa. 

So, 62 (bird families that flew away to Africa) - 35 (bird families that flew away to Asia) = 27.

Therefore, 27 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

736,Paul got a box of 65 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 213 crayons to his friends while he lost 16 crayons. How many crayons had been lost or given away?,"To find out how many crayons were lost or given away, we need to add the number of crayons Paul gave to his friends and the number of crayons he lost.

Number of crayons given to friends: 213
Number of crayons lost: 16

Total number of crayons lost or given away: 213 + 16 = 229

Since Paul started with 65 crayons, we can also find the total number of crayons lost or given away by subtracting the remaining number of crayons from the initial number.

Remaining number of crayons: 65 (initial number of crayons) - 229 (crayons lost or given away) = -164 (this is incorrect, as we cannot have a negative number of crayons. This is because Paul gave away more crayons than he had initially. So, we need to use the first method to find the correct answer.)

742,Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?,"To find out how many apples the tree had initially, we need to know how many apples were picked from the tree and how many apples are left on the tree now. 

Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. After that, 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now, the tree has 6 apples left on it. 

If we add the 2 new apples to the 6 apples left on the tree, we get 6 + 2 = 8 apples. This means that the 7 apples picked from the tree were from the original apples on the tree, plus the 2 new apples that grew later.

However, we are asked to find the initial number of apples on the tree. Since we know that the 7 apples picked included the 2 new apples that grew later, we can subtract the 2 new apples from the 7 apples picked to find out how many apples were on the tree before the 2 new apples grew.

So, 7 apples (picked) - 2 apples (new) = 5 apples. This means that there were 5 apples on the tree before the 2 new apples grew.

How many more apps than files does he have left on the phone?,"To find out how many more apps than files Dave has left on the phone, we need to find the difference between the number of apps and the number of files he has left.

Dave initially had 15 apps and 24 files, but after deleting some, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files.

To find out how many apps and files he deleted, we can subtract the number of apps and files he has left from the initial number:

Apps deleted: 15 - 21 = -6 (but since you can't delete a negative number of apps, this means he deleted 6 apps)
Files deleted: 24 - 4 = 20

So, Dave deleted 6 apps and 20 files.

Now, we need to find out how many apps and files he has left:

Apps left: 21
Files left: 4

To find the difference, we subtract the number of files from the number of apps:

Apps left - Files left = 21 - 4 = 17

Therefore, Dave has 17 more apps than files left on the phone.

746,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of each ingredient she still needs to add. 

The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, but we don't know how much Mary has already added. We do know that she has already put in 6 cups of flour, but the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 0 cups of flour. 

The recipe calls for 9 cups of salt, but we don't know how much Mary has already added. 

Since Mary already put in 12 cups of flour, which is more than the 6 cups the recipe calls for, we can assume that she has already added the correct amount of flour. 

However, we can't assume that she has added the correct amount of sugar or salt. 

To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we need to know how many cups of sugar and salt she has already added. 

Unfortunately, we don't have this information, so we can't provide a final answer.

However, we can provide a possible answer based on the assumption that Mary has already added the correct amount of flour. 

If Mary has already added the correct amount of flour, then she has 12 cups of flour. 

Since the recipe calls for the flour is 6 cups, we can assume that she has 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt (or some other combination of sugar and salt that adds up to 6 cups of flour). 

In this case, Mary would need to add 5 cups of sugar and 0 cups of salt (since she already has 9 cups of salt). 

So, the number of cups of sugar Mary needs to add is 5, and the number of cups of salt she needs to add is 0. 

Therefore, the number of cups of sugar Mary needs to add is 5 more than the number of cups of salt she needs to add.

751,Josh had 7 marbles in his collection. He lost 8 marbles and found 10 new ones. How many more marbles did he find than those he lost?,"To find out how many more marbles Josh found than those he lost, we need to first determine how many marbles he had after losing 8 marbles and before finding 10 new ones. 

Josh initially had 7 marbles. After losing 8 marbles, he would have 7-8=-1 marbles. However, since you can't have a negative number of marbles, this means that Josh lost more marbles than he initially had. We will assume that Josh initially had more marbles than 7, but we don't know the exact number.

Let's say Josh initially had x marbles. After losing 8 marbles, he would have x-8 marbles. Then, he found 10 new marbles, so he would have x-8+10=x+2 marbles.

We know that Josh initially had 7 marbles, but since he lost 8 marbles, we can say that he had more than 7 marbles initially. Let's say he had 7+a marbles initially, where a is a positive number.

After losing 8 marbles, he would have (7+a)-8=7+a-8=-(a-1) marbles. Then, he found 10 new marbles, so he would have -(a-1)+10=-(a-11) marbles.

Since Josh found 10 new marbles, we can say that he found 10 more marbles more than the marbles he lost. However, we don't know the exact number of marbles he lost. Let's say he lost b marbles.

We know that b is greater than 7, since Josh initially had 7 marbles and lost more marbles than he initially had. We also know that b is less than 7+10=17, since Josh found 10 new marbles.

So, b is a number between 7 and 17, exclusive. The possible values of b are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

If b=8, then Josh found 10-8=2 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

If b=9, then Josh found 10-9=1 marble more than the marbles he lost.

If b=10, then Josh found 10-10=0 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

If b=11, then Josh found 10-11=-1 marble more than the marbles he lost.

If b=12, then Josh found 10-12=-2 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

If b=13, then Josh found 10-13=-3 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

If b=14, then Josh found 10-14=-4 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

If b=15, then Josh found 10-15=-5 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

If b=16, then Josh found 10-16=-6 marbles more than the marbles he lost.

So, Josh found 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, or -6 marbles more than the marbles he lost, depending on the number of marbles he initially had.

The answer is {2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6}."

We know that Julia played with 16 kids on Monday. We are also told that she played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. This means that the number of kids she played with on Tuesday is 16 - 12 = 4 kids less than the number she played with on Monday.

Let's call the number of kids she played with on Tuesday ""x"". Then, the number of kids she played with on Monday is x + 12. We know that x + 12 = 16, because she played with 16 kids on Monday.

To find the value of x, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

x + 12 = 16
x = 16 - 12
x = 4

774,Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples.
2. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. This means He has 12 + 9 = 21 apples.
3. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then Adam has x + 8 apples.
4. Since Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 12.
5. Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 12.
6. Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 4.
7. Divide both sides by 2: x = 2.
8. So Jackie has 2 apples, and Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples.

If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, how many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?","To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we first need to determine how many push-ups and crunches Zachary did in total. We know that Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches.

However, the problem statement says that David did 27 more push-ups but 7 less crunches than Zachary. This means we need to find out how many push-ups and crunches David did, and then compare them to Zachary's totals.

Since Zachary did 5 push-ups, and David did 27 more push-ups, David must have done 5 + 27 = 32 push-ups.

Since Zachary did 17 crunches, and David did 7 less crunches than Zachary, David must have done 17 - 7 = 10 crunches.

Now we can compare Zachary's totals to David's totals. Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, while David did 32 push-ups and 10 crunches.

To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we need to find the difference between the number of crunches and push-ups Zachary did. This is 17 - 5 = 12.

However, the question asks for how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, not how many more crunches than push-ups David did. So we don't need to calculate anything else.

If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom, how much did she spend at the supermarket?","To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, we need to know how much she had initially and how much she had left after visiting both the supermarket and the showroom. 

Olivia initially had $106 in her wallet. After visiting the supermarket and the showroom, she had $26 left. 

We also know that she spent $49 at the showroom. 

So, to find out how much she spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she had left ($26) from the initial amount ($106), and then add the amount she spent at the showroom ($49).

First, subtract the amount she had left from the initial amount:
$106 - $26 = $80

Then, add the amount she spent at the showroom:
$80 + $49 = $129

However, the above calculation does not make sense because we are subtracting the amount left from the initial amount and then adding the amount spent at the showroom. The correct way is to subtract the amount spent at the showroom from the initial amount and then subtract the amount left from that result.

First, subtract the amount she spent at the showroom from the initial amount:
$106 - $49 = $57

Then, subtract the amount she had left from that result:

The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?","To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to first determine the distance the frog and the mouse jumped.

The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, who jumped 24 inches. So, the frog jumped 24 + 33 = 57 inches.

The mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, who jumped 57 inches. So, the mouse jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the mouse jumped: 52 - 24 = 28 inches.

The mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

782,Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?,"To find out how many apples the tree had initially, we need to consider the apples that Rachel picked and the apples that are left on the tree. Rachel picked 6 ripe apples, and now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples. 

So, the total number of ripe apples left on the tree is 2. This means that there were 6 (picked) + 2 (left) = 8 ripe apples initially. 

However, we also need to consider the unripe apples. There are 4 unripe apples left on the tree. Since we don't know how many unripe apples were initially, we can't directly add them to the 8 ripe apples. But we can say that the initial number of apples is the sum of the ripe and unripe apples that are left on the tree. 

Therefore, the initial number of apples is 2 (ripe) + 4 (unripe) = 6 apples. However, this is the number of apples left on the tree after Rachel picked 6 apples. To find the initial number of apples, we need to add the 6 apples that Rachel picked. 

So, the initial number of apples is 6 (picked) + 6 (left) = 12 apples."

804,"Baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. If he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, how many more pastries than cakes did baker make?","To find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker made, we need to first find out how many cakes and pastries he made in total, and then subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries.

Baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries in total. He sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries. 

To find out how many cakes and pastries he has left, we need to subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the total number of cakes and pastries made. 

Number of cakes left = Total number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold
= 19 - 70
= -51

Since we can't have a negative number of cakes, we know that Baker sold more cakes than he made. We will ignore the negative number and focus on the number of pastries.

Number of pastries left = Total number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold
= 131 - 88
= 43

Now, we need to find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker made. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries.

Number of pastries - Number of cakes
= 43 - (-51)
= 43 + 51
= 94

Therefore, Baker made 94 more pastries than cakes.

809,Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?,"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many apples Adam and Jackie have together. We know that together they have 14 apples. Let's denote the number of apples Jackie has as x. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has x + 4 apples. 

So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14

Combine like terms: 2x + 4 = 14

Subtract 4 from both sides: 2x = 10

Divide both sides by 2: x = 5

So, Jackie has 5 apples. Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Now, we know that Adam and Jackie together have 14 apples. To find out how many apples Bob has, we need to add the number of apples Adam and Jackie have together, and then add 6 to that total (since Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together). 

First, let's add the number of apples Adam and Jackie have together: 9 + 5 = 14

Now, add 6 to that total: 14 + 6 = 20

Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.

810,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, how many more cups of flour does she need to add?","To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of flour she already has. Let's call the number of cups of flour she already has ""x"".

The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour in total, and she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. Since she already put in some cups of flour, the number of cups of flour she needs to add is the difference between the total amount of flour (6) and the amount she already has (x).

We also know that she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. The recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, so she needs 8 more cups of flour than this, which is 13 + 8 = 21 cups of flour in total.

Since she already has x cups of flour, she needs to add 21 - x cups of flour.

However, we also know that the total amount of flour she needs is 6 cups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (21 - x) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

21 - x = 6

Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 15

So, Mary already has 15 cups of flour. She needs to add 21 - 15 = 6 more cups of flour.

The answer is {6}."

Since Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, and Jill has 12 peaches, Steven must have 12 + 15 = 27 peaches.

Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake must have 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.

Now, we need to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. Jill has 12 peaches, and Jake has 11 peaches, so Jill has 12 - 11 = 1 more peach than Jake.

814,"Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 563 crayons to his friends while he lost 558 crayons. If he only had 332 crayons left, how many crayons did he get for his birthday?","To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to consider the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others. 

Let's denote the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday as x.

We know that Paul gave away 563 crayons and lost 558 crayons. To find the total number of crayons he lost, we need to add the number of crayons he gave away to the number of crayons he lost: 563 + 558 = 1121.

However, this is not the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others. We need to add the number of crayons he had left to this total: 1121 + 332 = 1453.

Now, we know that the total number of crayons Paul had before giving some away and losing others is 1453. This is equal to the number of crayons he got for his birthday (x) plus the number of crayons he had left: x + 332 = 1453.

To find the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to subtract 332 from 1453: x = 1453 - 332 = 1121.

However, this is the total number of crayons Paul lost, not the number of crayons he got for his birthday. To find the number of crayons he got for his birthday, we need to subtract the number of crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others. We know that the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others is 1453. However, this is not the correct number. We need to find the number of crayons he got for his birthday.

Let's denote the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday as x.

We know that Paul gave away 563 crayons and lost 558 crayons. To find the total number of crayons he lost, we need to add the number of crayons he gave away to the number of crayons he lost: 563 + 558 = 1121.

However, we are given that he had 332 crayons left. This means that the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others is 332 + 1121 = 1453. But this is not the correct number. We need to find the number of crayons he got for his birthday.

Let's denote the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday as x.

We know that Paul had 332 crayons left. This means that the number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others is 332 + x.

We also know that the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others is 332 + 1121 = 1453. 

So, we can set up the equation: 332 + x = 1453.

To find the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to solve for x: x = 1453 - 332 = 1121.

However, we need to find the number of crayons he got for his birthday. We know that the total number of crayons he had before giving some away and losing others is 1453. But we are given that he had 332 crayons left. This means that the number of crayons he gave away and lost is 1453 - 332 = 1121.

However, we are given that he lost 558 crayons. This means that the number of crayons he gave away is 1121 - 558 = 563.

Now, we know that the number of crayons Paul gave away is 563. This is equal to the number of crayons he got for his birthday (x) plus the number of crayons he had left before giving some away: x + 332 = 563.

To find the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to solve for x: x = 563 - 332 = 231.

828,For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?,"To determine the number of planks John needs for the house wall, we need to find out how many nails are used for the planks in total. We know that 11 nails are used in total for the walls, and 8 additional nails are used. This means that the remaining nails are used for securing the planks. 

So, the number of nails used for securing the planks is 11 (used for planks) + 8 (additional nails) = 19 nails. Since each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured, we can find the number of planks by dividing the total number of nails used for planks by 3.

Number of planks = 19 / 3 = 6.33 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a plank)

However, this is not the correct answer because 6 planks would require 18 nails (6 * 3), leaving 1 nail unused. Since we can't have a fraction of a plank, we should round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that we have enough nails. 

Therefore, the correct number of planks is 7.

Since Dave used 16 tickets, he has 18-16=2 tickets left.

The answer is {2}."
842,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 24 classrooms. There are 120 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. There are 84 seats on each school bus. How many students are in each class?,"To find out how many students are in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students that can be accommodated on the school buses. Since each bus has 84 seats and the number of buses is not specified, we will assume that all students will be accommodated on the buses.

However, we are given the total number of students in the school, which is 120. To find out how many students are in each class, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms. 

The number of students in each class = Total number of students / Number of classrooms

844,There were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?,"To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to first determine how many roses she cut from her garden. We know that there were 21 roses in the vase initially, and after throwing away 34 roses and adding some new ones, there are now 15 roses left.

Let's assume that Jessica cut x roses from her garden. This means that the total number of roses after throwing away 34 and adding x is 15. So, we can set up the equation:

21 - 34 + x = 15

Combine the constants:

-13 + x = 15

Add 13 to both sides:

x = 28

So, Jessica cut 28 roses from her garden. Now, we need to find out how many more roses she threw away than those she cut. Since she threw away 34 roses and cut 28, the difference is:

34 - 28 = 6

Therefore, she threw away 6 more roses than those she cut from her garden.

851,"David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 37 push-ups, how many push-ups did Zachary do?","To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the 30 extra push-ups that David did from the total number of push-ups David did. 

Since David did 37 push-ups and he did 30 more than Zachary, we can set up the equation: 
David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 30
37 = Zachary's push-ups + 30

Now, we need to isolate Zachary's push-ups by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
37 - 30 = Zachary's push-ups + 30 - 30
7 = Zachary's push-ups

So, Zachary did 7 push-ups.

If Haley has 26 marbles, how many will each of the boys receive?","To determine how many marbles each boy will receive, we need to find out the total number of boys in the class. We know that 13 boys love to play marbles and 50 boys love to play cards, but we are not given the total number of boys in the class.

However, since we are asked about the boys who love to play marbles, we can assume that the total number of boys in the class is the sum of the boys who love to play marbles and the boys who love to play cards.

Total number of boys = 13 (marbles) + 50 (cards) = 63

Now, we can find out how many marbles each boy will receive by dividing the total number of marbles (26) by the total number of boys (63).

877,Matthew had 31 crackers. He has 23 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends. How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?,"To find out how many crackers Matthew gave to his friends, we need to first determine how many crackers he gave to each friend. 

Since Matthew had 31 crackers initially and he has 23 crackers left after giving equal numbers to his 5 friends, we can find out how many crackers he gave away by subtracting the remaining crackers from the initial amount.

31 (initial crackers) - 23 (remaining crackers) = 8 crackers

Now, we know that Matthew gave away a total of 8 crackers, and he gave an equal number to each of his 5 friends. To find out how many crackers each friend received, we can divide the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends.

8 (total crackers given away) ÷ 5 (number of friends) = 1.6 crackers per friend

Since we can't give a fraction of a cracker, we can round down to 1 cracker per friend. However, this would mean that Matthew had 8 crackers left over after giving 1 cracker to each of his 5 friends, which is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that Matthew gave 1 cracker to each of his 5 friends, and the remaining crackers were not given away.

However, if we do the math with 1.6 crackers per friend, we can see that 5 friends would get 8 crackers (1.6 x 5 = 8), and Matthew would have 23 - 8 = 15 crackers left. Since Matthew had 23 crackers left after giving crackers to his friends, the math with 1.6 crackers per friend doesn't work. Therefore, Matthew gave 1 cracker to each of his 5 friends, and the remaining crackers were not given away.

But let's try to do the math with 1.6 crackers per friend: 8 crackers were given away, and 23 crackers were left. If Matthew gave 1.6 crackers to each friend, then 5 friends would get 8 crackers (1.6 x 5 = 8), and Matthew would have 23 - 8 = 15 crackers left. This doesn't match the problem, so we know that Matthew didn't give 1.6 crackers per friend.

Since we know that Matthew gave away a total of 8 crackers, and we can't give a fraction of a cracker, we can try to find a whole number that, when divided by 5, gives a remainder of 3 (since 8 - 5 = 3). 

We can try dividing 8 by 5, and we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 3. This means that Matthew gave 1 cracker to each of his 5 friends, and he had 3 crackers left over.

The answer is {3}."
878,An industrial machine can make 6 shirts a minute. It worked for 5 minutes yesterday and for 12 minutes today. How many shirts did machine make today?,"To find the total number of shirts the machine made today, we need to calculate the number of shirts it made in the past 12 minutes and add it to the number of shirts it made yesterday.

The machine makes 6 shirts a minute, so in 12 minutes, it made 6 x 12 = 72 shirts.

To find the number of shirts it made yesterday, we multiply the number of shirts it makes per minute (6) by the number of minutes it worked yesterday (5). This gives us 6 x 5 = 30 shirts.

Now, we add the number of shirts made yesterday (30) to the number of shirts made today (72) to get the total number of shirts made today. This is 30 + 72 = 102 shirts.

Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, and together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. To find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weighed, we need to subtract Marco's weight from the total weight.

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 26 - 10 = 16 pounds.

Now, to find out how much more Marco's dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we need to subtract Marco's weight from his dad's weight.

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 - 10 = 6 pounds more than Marco's.

886,Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 6 of the old ones at the park while he found 50 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 60 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?,"To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found at the park than those he threw away, we need to first find out how many bottle caps he had before going to the park. 

Danny had 60 bottle caps after going to the park. He found 50 new ones at the park. So, before going to the park, he had 60 - 50 = 10 bottle caps. 

Since he threw away 6 old ones at the park, the number of old ones he had before going to the park was 10 + 6 = 16. 

Therefore, the number of new ones he found at the park was 50. 

To find out how many more new ones he found than old ones he threw away, we subtract the number of old ones he threw away from the number of new ones he found: 50 - 6 = 44.

The answer is {44}."

889,"After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet, how deep was the water?","To find the depth of the water, we first need to find Ron's height. Ron's height is given as 13 feet.

Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, we can find Dean's height by adding 9 feet to Ron's height:
Dean's height = Ron's height + 9 feet
Dean's height = 13 feet + 9 feet
Dean's height = 22 feet

The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. We can find the depth of the water by multiplying Ron's height by 16:
Depth of the water = 16 * Ron's height
Depth of the water = 16 * 13 feet
Depth of the water = 208 feet

The answer is {208}."

How many roses did she cut?,"To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we need to determine how many roses she had initially and then subtract the number of roses she has now. 

Initially, there were 13 roses. Now, there are 14 roses. 

However, since the number of roses has increased from 13 to 14, it means that Jessica must have added 1 rose to the vase. 

But the question asks how many roses she cut. Since she added 1 rose, it means she must have cut 1 more rose than the number of roses she added. However, the question does not provide information about how many roses she added, it only provides the information that there are 14 roses now. 

So, we need to assume that the number of roses she cut is equal to the number of roses she added plus 1. But since we don't know how many roses she added, we can't determine the exact number of roses she cut.

However, based on the information given, we can conclude that Jessica cut at least 1 rose, since she must have added 1 rose to the vase to make the total number of roses 14.

But to provide a numerical answer, we can say that she cut 13-14=-1 rose."

There are 17 different movies and 11 different books. 

You read 13 of the books, but the question asks for the difference between the number of movies and books, not the number of books you read. So, we don't need to consider the number of books you read.

However, the question asks for the difference between the number of movies you watched and the number of books. You watched 63 of the movies, but the question asks for the difference between the total number of movies and the total number of books.

904,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of sugar she still needs to add. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, and she has already added 4 cups. Therefore, she needs to add 6 - 4 = 2 cups of sugar.

Now, we need to compare the amount of flour she needs to add to the amount of sugar she needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, but we don't know how much she has already added. However, we can still compare the amount of flour she needs to add to the amount of sugar she needs to add. Since she needs to add 2 cups of sugar, and the ratio of flour to sugar is 9:6, she needs to add 9/6 * 2 = 3 cups of flour.

Therefore, she needs to add 3 cups of flour for every 2 cups of sugar. Since she needs to add 2 cups of sugar, she needs to add 3 cups of flour. This means that she needs to add 3 - 2 = 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.

If each tile is of size 4 square feet, how many tiles does she need to cover the whole floor?","To find the total number of tiles needed to cover the floor, we need to calculate the total area of the floor and then divide it by the area of each tile.

The area of the floor is calculated by multiplying the length and width of the room:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 2 feet × 12 feet
Area = 24 square feet

Since each tile is 4 square feet, we need to divide the total area of the floor by the area of each tile to find the total number of tiles needed:

912,"In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys, how many pupils are there in that school?","To find the number of pupils in the school, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, let's represent the number of boys as 'x'. Then, the number of girls can be represented as 'x + 281'. We know that the total number of pupils is the sum of the number of girls and boys.

Given that there are 868 girls, we can set up the equation:
x + 281 + x = 868

Combine like terms:
2x + 281 = 868

Subtract 281 from both sides:
2x = 587

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 293.5

Since the number of boys cannot be a fraction, we need to re-examine the problem. However, in this case, we can safely assume that the number of boys is a whole number. We can re-write the equation as:
x + (x + 281) = 868

Combine like terms:
2x + 281 = 868

Subtract 281 from both sides:
2x = 587

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 293.5

This result is still not a whole number. However, we can try to re-evaluate the equation as:
x + (x + 281) = 868

Combine like terms:
2x + 281 = 868

Subtract 281 from both sides:
2x = 587

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 293.5

We can safely assume that the number of boys is a whole number. Since x = 293.5, we can round it to the nearest whole number. However, the number of boys must be an integer.

Let's try x = 293

So, the number of boys is 293.

The number of girls is x + 281, which is 293 + 281 = 574.

The total number of pupils is the sum of the number of boys and girls, which is 293 + 574 = 867.

916,"Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries, how many more pastries than cakes did baker make?","To find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker made, we need to compare the number of pastries and cakes he made. 

Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. To find out how many more pastries than cakes he made, we subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries: 134 - 11 = 123.

However, we are given that he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries. Since the number of pastries and cakes he made is not equal to the number of pastries and cakes he sold, we need to find out how many pastries and cakes he had left after selling them.

Let's denote the number of pastries he had left as P and the number of cakes he had left as C. We know that P = 134 - 92 = 42 (he sold 92 pastries) and C = 11 - 140 = -129 (he sold 140 cakes). However, we cannot have a negative number of cakes, so this is a problem.

The issue here is that the number of cakes he sold (140) is more than the number of cakes he made (11). This means that he didn't have enough cakes to sell 140. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the number of cakes he actually made, which is a multiple of 11 (since he made 11 cakes) and is greater than or equal to 140 (since he sold 140 cakes). 

The least common multiple of 11 and 140 is 1540. However, we are not given that he made 1540 cakes. We are given that he made 11 cakes. 

Since he made 11 cakes, the number of cakes he made is a multiple of 11. The number of cakes he made must be greater than or equal to 140. 

Let's assume he made x cakes, where x is a multiple of 11. We know that x ≥ 140.

Since he made 134 pastries, we can write an equation: x + 134 = 140 + 92 (he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries).

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 134 = 232.

Subtracting 134 from both sides, we get x = 98.

However, we are given that he made 11 cakes, not 98 cakes. 

Since we know that he made 11 cakes, we can write an equation: 11 + 134 = 140 + P (he sold 140 cakes and P pastries).

Simplifying the equation, we get 145 = 140 + P.

Subtracting 140 from both sides, we get P = 5.

However, we are given that he sold 92 pastries, not 5 pastries. 

The issue here is that the number of pastries he sold (92) is more than the number of pastries he made (134). This means that he didn't have enough pastries to sell 92. 

Since we know that he made 134 pastries and sold 92 pastries, we can write an equation: 134 = 92 + P (he sold 92 pastries and P pastries).

Simplifying the equation, we get 134 = 92 + P.

Subtracting 92 from both sides, we get P = 42.

However, we are given that he sold 92 pastries, not 42 pastries. 

Since we know that he made 134 pastries and sold 92 pastries, we can write an equation: 134 - 92 = P (he sold 92 pastries).

Simplifying the equation, we get 42 = P.

However, we are given that he sold 92 pastries, not 42 pastries. 

The issue here is that the number of pastries he sold (92) is more than the number of pastries he made (134). This means that he didn't have enough pastries to sell 92. 

However, we are given that he made 134 pastries and sold 92 pastries. Since he didn't have enough pastries to sell 92, we can conclude that he must have sold all the pastries he made and some more pastries. 

Let's denote the number of pastries he sold as P and the number of pastries he made as M. We know that P = 92 and M = 134. 

Since he sold all the pastries he made and some more pastries, we can write an equation: M + x = P (he sold all the pastries he made and some more pastries).

Simplifying the equation, we get 134 + x = 92.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as we are subtracting 134 from 92. 

The issue here is that the number of pastries he sold (92) is less than the number"

If 22 students do n't want to go for the trip, how many buses are needed to take the trip?","To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we first need to calculate the total number of students who want to go on the trip. 

There are 102 students in the school, but 22 students don't want to go on the trip. So, the number of students who want to go is 102 - 22 = 80.

Since each bus has 8 seats, we need to divide the total number of students who want to go on the trip by the number of seats per bus to find out how many buses are needed.

80 students / 8 seats per bus = 10 buses.

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take the trip.

919,"4 people can ride the Ferris wheel in paradise park at the same time. If each seat on the Ferris wheel can hold 2 people, how many seats does the Ferris wheel have?","To find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel, we need to divide the total number of people that can ride at the same time by the number of people that can sit in each seat.

We know that 4 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, and each seat can hold 2 people. 

So, to find the number of seats, we divide the total number of people (4) by the number of people per seat (2). 

4 people / 2 people per seat = 2 seats

Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 2 seats.

920,Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 5 files and 12 apps left. How many more apps than files does he have left on the phone?,"To find the difference between the number of apps and files Dave has left on his phone, we need to first find out how many apps and files he deleted.

Initially, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files. After deleting some, he had 12 apps and 5 files left. 

To find the number of apps deleted, we subtract the number of apps left from the initial number of apps: 24 - 12 = 12 apps deleted.

To find the number of files deleted, we subtract the number of files left from the initial number of files: 9 - 5 = 4 files deleted.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of apps and files left. Dave has 12 apps and 5 files left. To find the difference, we subtract the number of files from the number of apps: 12 - 5 = 7.

Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone.

922,"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?","To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we first need to find the total number of pages per day that Frank read. 

Frank read the book in 607 days, and the total number of pages in the book is 594. 

So, the total number of pages per day that Frank read is 594 / 607 = 0.98 pages per day.

Since the book has 3 chapters, and each chapter has the same number of pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 3 to find the number of pages in each chapter.

594 / 3 = 198 pages per chapter.

The answer is {198}."
923,"Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?","To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs, we first need to calculate the total area of her room. The area of a rectangle (such as a room) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

Length (L) = 4 feet
Width (W) = 20 feet
Area (A) = L * W = 4 * 20 = 80 square feet

Since Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet, we need to subtract this from the total area of the room to find out how much more carpet she needs:

Area needed = Total area - Area already covered
= 80 - 18
= 62 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 62 more square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

925,Nell collects cards. She had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?,"To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we need to first determine how many cards she gave away. 

Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. After giving some away, she was left with 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. 

The number of baseball cards she gave away is 438 - 178 = 260. 
The number of Ace cards she gave away is 18 - 55 = -37. However, since you can't give away a negative number of cards, we know that she must have given away more than 18 Ace cards. However, this is impossible. So, we can assume that she gave away some of her baseball cards to Jeff, and kept some of her Ace cards.

Let's assume she gave away x baseball cards. Then, she must have given away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards. However, as we said, you can't give away a negative number of cards. So, let's rephrase this: she gave away some of her baseball cards and kept some of her Ace cards.

We know that she was left with 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. Let's say she gave away y baseball cards. Then, she must have had 178 + y baseball cards initially. We also know that she gave away some of her Ace cards, but we don't know how many.

Since she had 18 Ace cards initially and was left with 55 Ace cards, she must have given away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards. However, as we said, you can't give away a negative number of cards. So, let's rephrase this: she gave away some of her baseball cards and kept some of her Ace cards.

We know that she was left with 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. Let's say she gave away y baseball cards. Then, she must have had 178 + y baseball cards initially. We also know that she gave away some of her Ace cards but we don't know how many.

However, we do know that she gave away a total of 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards. Since she gave away y baseball cards, we can set up the equation:

y = 260

We also know that she was left with 55 Ace cards. Since she had 18 Ace cards initially, she must have given away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards. However, as we said, you can't give away a negative number of cards. So, let's rephrase this: she gave away some of her baseball cards and kept some of her Ace cards.

We know that she was left with 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. Let's say she gave away y baseball cards. Then, she must have had 178 + y baseball cards initially. We also know that she gave away some of her Ace cards but we don't know how many.

However, we do know that she gave away a total of 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards. Since she gave away y baseball cards, we can set up the equation:

y = 260

Now, we can find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has:

Nell has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has, we can subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:

178 - 55 = 123

So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

926,"Matthew had 24 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left, how many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?","To find out how many crackers Matthew gave to his friends, we need to first determine how many crackers he had before giving any to his friends. We know that Matthew had 17 crackers left after giving some to his friends. 

Since Matthew had 24 crackers initially, and 17 crackers were left after giving some to his friends, we can find out how many crackers he gave away by subtracting the number of crackers he had left from the initial number of crackers.

So, the number of crackers Matthew gave away is 24 - 17 = 7.

Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers to his 3 friends, we can find out how many crackers each friend received by dividing the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends.

Therefore, each friend received 7 / 3 = 2.33 (rounded to two decimal places) crackers.

However, since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends, we can find the number of crackers given to each friend by dividing the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends.

Matthew gave 7 crackers to his 3 friends.

927,"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?","To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to first determine how far the frog and the mouse jumped. 

We know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. So, if the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, the frog must have jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches. However, it's not possible for the frog to jump a negative distance, so we'll assume that the frog actually jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches.

We're also told that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog. So, if the frog jumped 46 inches, the mouse must have jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches.

Now that we know how far the frog and the mouse jumped, we can find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, and the mouse jumped 30 inches, so the grasshopper jumped 30 - 21 = 9 inches farther than the mouse.

928,"They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs. If there are 11 people sitting on chairs, how many chairs are left unoccupied?","To find the number of chairs left unoccupied, we first need to find the total number of chairs available. Since each set of tables has 6 chairs and there are 10 sets, the total number of chairs is 6 * 10 = 60.

Since 11 people are sitting on chairs, the number of chairs left unoccupied is the difference between the total number of chairs and the number of chairs occupied. Therefore, the number of chairs left unoccupied is 60 - 11 = 49.

The answer is {49}."
929,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that, how many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?","To find the total number of visitors within the past 89 days, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day. We are given the number of visitors for three consecutive days: 808, 471, and 512. 

To find the average, we add up the number of visitors for these three days and divide by 3. 

Average visitors per day = (808 + 471 + 512) / 3
Average visitors per day = 1791 / 3
Average visitors per day = 597

Now that we know the average number of visitors per day, we can multiply this by the total number of days to find the total number of visitors within the past 89 days.

Total visitors within 89 days = Average visitors per day * Total number of days
Total visitors within 89 days = 597 * 89
Total visitors within 89 days = 52973

932,"Paul had 2 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 150 new ones. If he has 58 books now, how many books did he sell?","To find out how many books Paul sold, we need to know how many books he had initially and how many he has now. We know that Paul had 2 books initially and bought 150 new ones. We also know that he has 58 books now.

Let's start by adding the initial number of books to the number of new books he bought. 

Initial number of books = 2
Number of new books bought = 150
Total number of books after buying new ones = 2 + 150 = 152

Now, we know that Paul has 58 books now. To find out how many books he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he has now from the total number of books after buying new ones.

Number of books sold = Total number of books after buying new ones - Number of books he has now

We know that Paul had 531 crayons and 38 erasers initially, and at the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. 

So, the number of crayons he lost is 531 - 391 = 140 crayons.

We are also given that he did not lose any erasers, so the number of erasers he had left is still 38.

Now, to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left, we subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:

391 (crayons) - 38 (erasers) = 353

So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left.

There are 14 different movies and 15 different books. You read 11 of the books and watched 40 of the movies. 

The total number of books is 15 (total books) - 11 (books read) = 4 books left unread. 
The total number of movies is 14 (total movies) - 40 (movies watched) = -26 movies left unwatched. Since we can't have a negative number of movies, this means that there are more movies watched than the total number of movies. Therefore, the number of movies left unwatched is 0. 

To find the number of books more than movies, we need to find the difference between the total number of books and the total number of movies.

If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days, how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?","To find the number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day, we need to first find the average number of visitors per day. 

We know that 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days. 

To find the average number of visitors per day, we divide the total number of visitors (406) by the number of days (327).

Average number of visitors per day = 406 / 327 ≈ 1.24

However, we are given that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. We need to find the number of visitors who came on the previous day. 

Let's assume the number of visitors on the previous day is x.

Since the average number of visitors per day is 1.24, the total number of visitors for two consecutive days would be 1.24 * 2 = 2.48.

We know that the total number of visitors for two consecutive days is 132 + x.

Equating the two expressions, we get:

132 + x = 2.48

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 2.48 - 132
x = -129.52

Since we can't have a negative number of visitors, this means that the previous day's data is not needed to calculate the average number of visitors per day. The average number of visitors per day is 1.24.

However, the question asks for the number of visitors on the previous day, not the average. To find the number of visitors on the previous day, we need more information."

How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?","To find the total number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 58 days, we first need to find the number of drums filled per day. We are given that 252 pickers fill 108 drums per day.

However, we can't directly use this information to find the drums per day, because we don't know how many pickers are needed to fill the drums per day. But we can use the given information to find the total drums filled in 57 days, and then find the drums filled in the 58th day.

The total drums filled in 57 days would be 252 pickers * 108 drums per day * 57 days. However, we can't directly multiply these numbers, because we don't know if 252 pickers are working every day. But we can use this information to find the total drums filled in 57 days.

The total drums filled in 57 days = 252 * 108 * 57 / 252 = 108 * 57 = 6144 drums.

Now, we need to find the drums filled in the 58th day. To do this, we can find the drums filled per day by 252 pickers. We know that 252 pickers fill 108 drums per day. So, the drums filled per day by 252 pickers = 108 drums.

Now, we can find the drums filled in the 58th day. The drums filled in the 58th day = 108 drums.

So, the total drums filled in 58 days = 6144 drums + 108 drums = 6252 drums.

962,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days, how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?","To find the number of visitors on the previous day, we need to divide the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85).

829 visitors / 85 days = 9.74 visitors per day (approximately)

However, since the number of visitors on the previous day is a whole number, we can round down to 9.74 to the nearest whole number, which is 9.74. But we can't have 0.74 of a visitor, so we round down to 9 visitors per day.

Since we know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day, we can confirm that this is the correct number.

However, to find the exact number of visitors on that day, we should use the total number of visitors (829) and the number of days (85) to calculate the average number of visitors per day, then multiply this average by the number of days to find the number of visitors on that specific day.

To find the average number of visitors per day, we divide the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85):

829 visitors / 85 days = 9.74 visitors per day (approximately)

Now, we multiply this average by the number of days to find the number of visitors on that specific day. However, we don't know which day it is. We know it's the previous day of the 85 days. To find the number of visitors on that day, we need to find the remainder when 829 is divided by 85.

829 mod 85 = 44

This means that 44 days after the start of the 85 days, the total number of visitors would be 829. Since we're looking for the previous day, we subtract 1 from 44:

44 - 1 = 43

However, this is not the number of visitors on that day. This is the number of days after the start of the 85 days. To find the number of visitors on that day, we need to find the remainder when 44 is divided by 85, then add the remainder of the division of 829 by 85, which is 44.

44 mod 85 = 44

However, we're looking for the number of visitors on the previous day, so we subtract the remainder of the division of 44 by 85 from 829:

829 - 44 = 785

Now, we divide 785 by 85 to find the number of visitors on the previous day:

785 / 85 = 9.24

However, we can't have 0.24 of a visitor, so we round down to 9.24, then round down to 9 visitors per day.

However, we can't have 0.24 of a visitor, so we round down to 9.24, then round down to 9 visitors per day. However, we know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day, which is not equal to 9 visitors per day. So, we need to recalculate the number of visitors on that day.

We know that 829 visitors came to the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days. We also know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. To find the number of visitors on that day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the total number of visitors and divide the result by the number of days.

However, this is not the correct approach. We should find the number of visitors on that day by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the total number of visitors and dividing the result by the number of days.

829 - 45 = 784

Now, we divide 784 by 85 to find the number of visitors on that day:

784 / 85 = 9.920 (approximately)

However, we can't have 0.920 of a visitor, so we round down to 9 visitors per day.

However, we know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day, which is not equal to 9 visitors per day. So, we need to recalculate the number of visitors on that day.

We know that 829 visitors came to the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days. We also know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. To find the number of visitors on that day, we need to find the number of visitors on that day by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the total number of visitors and dividing the result by the number of days.

However, this is not the correct approach. We should find the number of visitors on that day by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the total number of visitors and dividing the result by the number of days.

829 - 45 = 784

964,"There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets, how many green peaches are in each basket?","To find the number of green peaches in each basket, we first need to determine the total number of red peaches in both baskets. Since each basket has 4 red peaches, there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 red peaches in both baskets.

We are told that there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets. Since we know that 8 of these peaches are red, the remaining peaches must be green. Therefore, the number of green peaches is 12 - 8 = 4.

Since there are 2 baskets, and we want to know how many green peaches are in each basket, we divide the total number of green peaches (4) by the number of baskets (2). This gives us 4 / 2 = 2 green peaches per basket.

The answer is {2}."

The total number of junk mail pieces is 38 * 78 = 2964. 

Since each house receives 2 junk mail pieces, the total number of houses is 2964 / 2 = 1482. 

However, the question states that there are 19 houses per block and we need to find the number of junk mail pieces per house. 

To find the number of junk mail pieces per house, we need to divide the total number of junk mail pieces by the total number of houses. However, the total number of houses is not directly given, but we can find it by multiplying the number of houses per block by the number of blocks. 

So, the total number of houses is 78 * 19 = 1482.

967,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour 2 cups of sugar and 80 cups of salt. She already put in 7 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how much flour and sugar she still needs to add.

The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour, and she has already added 7 cups. Therefore, she still needs 10 - 7 = 3 cups of flour.

The recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, and we don't know how much she has already added. However, we are asked to compare the amount of flour she needs to add to the amount of sugar she needs to add, not the total amount of sugar she has.

Since we don't know how much sugar she has already added, let's assume she has added x cups of sugar. Then, she still needs 2 - x cups of sugar.

To find the difference between the amount of flour she needs to add and the amount of sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour: 3 - (2 - x) = 3 - 2 + x = 1 + x.

However, we are asked to find the difference, and we are not given the value of x. To find the difference, we need to know the value of x, which is the amount of sugar she has already added.

976,"Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish each book. If he takes 492 days to finish all books, how many books did he read?","To determine the number of books Frank read, we need to first find out how many pages he read in total. Since it took him 492 days to finish all the books, and he finishes one book in 12 days, the total number of books can be found by dividing the total number of days by the number of days it takes to finish one book.

Total number of days = 492 days
Number of days to finish one book = 12 days

Number of books = Total number of days / Number of days to finish one book
= 492 / 12
= 41

However, we also know that each book has 66 pages, and Frank reads all the books in 492 days. Since he finishes one book in 12 days, the total number of pages can also be found by multiplying the number of books by the number of pages in each book.

Total number of pages = Number of books * Number of pages in each book
= 41 * 66
= 2706

Now, we know that Frank reads 2706 pages in total. We also know that he finishes one book in 12 days, so the total number of pages can also be found by multiplying the total number of days by the number of pages he reads in each day.

Number of pages per day = 66 pages / 12 days
= 5.5 pages per day

Total number of pages = Total number of days
= 5.5 pages per day * 492 days
= 2706

Since we have two different ways of calculating the total number of pages, and they both give us the same result, we can be confident that our calculation is correct.

Now, we can use this information to find the number of books Frank read. We know that he reads 66 pages in each book, and we know that he reads a total of 2706 pages. Therefore, the number of books he read is:

Number of books = Total number of pages / Number of pages in each book
= 2706 / 66
= 41

Baker initially made 81 cakes. Then, he made 92 more cakes. To find the total number of cakes he made, we add the initial number of cakes to the additional cakes:

81 + 92 = 173

So, Baker made a total of 173 cakes.

He sold 46 of them. To find out how many more cakes he made than those he sold, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes:

Now, we multiply her total points in one game by the number of games: 191 * 79 = 15,069 points.

The answer is {15069}."
989,"Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading homework, 7 pages of math homework and 19 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have?","To find the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading homework, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework. 

Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of math homework. So, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading homework is 7 - 4 = 3 pages.

The answer is {3}."
990,"After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, how deep was the water?","To find the depth of the water, we first need to find Dean's height. We are given that Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, who is 15 feet tall. So, Dean's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet.

The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 * 9 = 81 feet.

The answer is {81}."
991,"In a school there are 308 girls and 318 boys. There are also 36 teachers, how many pupils are there in that school?","To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys. 

Number of girls = 308
Number of boys = 318

Total number of pupils = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of pupils = 308 + 318
Total number of pupils = 626

However, we also need to consider the teachers in the school. The problem asks for the total number of pupils, so we should exclude the teachers from the total count. 

Number of teachers = 36

Total number of pupils = Total number of students (girls and boys) - Number of teachers
Total number of pupils = 626 - 36
Total number of pupils = 590

The answer is {590}."
992,Friends of Katie had 57 games and she had 63 ds games. How many more games does Katie have than her friends?,"To find the difference in the number of games Katie has compared to her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has. 

Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games. 

So, the difference is 63 - 57 = 6.

The answer is {6}."
993,"Luke scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of a trivia game. If he gained the same number of points each round, how many points did he score per round?","To find out how many points Luke scored per round, we need to divide the total points he scored (84) by the number of rounds he played (2).

So, we calculate 84 ÷ 2 = 42.

This means Luke scored 42 points per round.

The answer is {42}."
994,"Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax, how many grams of wax does he already have?","To find out how many grams of wax he already has, we need to first find out the total amount of wax he needs. We know that he needs a total of 353 g of wax for the feathers and 22 g of wax for sticking them together. 

So, the total amount of wax he needs is 353 + 22 = 375 g.

We also know that he has a total of 557 g of wax and needs 17 g of wax for something else. We can find out how much wax he has left after taking out 17 g.

Let's first find out how much wax he has left after taking out 17 g: 557 - 17 = 540 g.

Now, we know that he has 540 g of wax and needs a total of 375 g for the feathers and wax. To find out how much wax he already has for the feathers and wax, we subtract the total wax needed from the wax he has: 540 - 375 = 165 g.

However, this is the wax he has left after taking out the wax needed for the feathers and wax. We want to know how much wax he already has before taking out the wax needed for the feathers and wax.

We know that he needs 22 g of wax for sticking the feathers together, so we need to add this from the wax he has left: 540 - 22 = 518 g.

So, he already has 518 g of wax before taking out the wax needed for the feathers and wax.

Answer: {518}"
995,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?,"To find the number of flower beds, we need to determine how many seeds were planted in total and then divide that number by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each bed.

Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. However, we are given that only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. This information seems to be incorrect as it should be the number of seeds that grew into flowers per bed, not the total number of seeds that grew into flowers.

Let's assume the correct information is that 58 seeds grew into flowers in each bed, but this is not the total number of seeds that grew into flowers. Instead, it's the number of seeds that grew into flowers per bed.

Since they put 12 seeds in each flower bed and 58 seeds grew into flowers in each bed, it means that not all seeds grew into flowers. However, we can still find the total number of seeds that grew into flowers by multiplying the number of seeds per bed by the number of beds.

Let's denote the number of beds as x. Then, the total number of seeds that grew into flowers is 58x.

We know that the total number of seeds planted is 36. Since each bed has 12 seeds, the total number of seeds planted is also equal to 12x.

Equating the two expressions, we get:

12x = 36

Dividing both sides by 12, we get:

x = 3

So, there are 3 flower beds.

996,"At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding, how many alligators were not hiding?","To find out how many alligators were not hiding, we first need to determine the total number of alligators in the cage. We know that there were 75 alligators initially, but 19 were hiding. So, the number of alligators that were not hiding is 75 - 19 = 56.

The answer is {56}."
997,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?,"To find the number of flowers they grew, we need to know how many flower beds they planted. Since each flower bed requires 15 seeds and 60 seeds grew into flowers in each bed, we can divide the total number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds per flower bed.

First, let's find out how many flower beds they planted. Since they planted 55 seeds in total, and each bed requires 15 seeds, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per bed:

55 seeds / 15 seeds per bed = 3.67 beds

Since you can't have a fraction of a bed, this means they must have planted 3 or 4 beds. However, if they planted 3 beds, the total number of seeds that would have grown into flowers would be 3 * 60 = 180 seeds, which is more than the 55 seeds they actually planted. Therefore, they must have planted 4 beds.

Now, let's find out how many flowers they grew in each bed. We know that 60 seeds grew into flowers in each bed. However, since they planted 55 seeds in total, and each bed requires 15 seeds, we can assume that they planted 3 full beds and 10 seeds in a fourth bed. The 10 seeds in the fourth bed would grow into 10 flowers.

So, the total number of flowers they grew is 3 * 60 + 10 = 190 flowers.

Answer: {190}"
