If he had <fact4>13 crackers</fact4> and <fact5>15 cakes</fact5> initially, how many <fact1>crackers</fact1> and <fact2>cakes</fact2> did each person eat?

Answer:  Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, and he had fewer crackers (<fact4>13</fact4>) than cakes (<fact5>15</fact5>), he could only give out 13 of each.

If there were <fact2>246 visitors on that day</fact2>, how many visited the Buckingham Palace within <fact3>25 days</fact3>?

Answer:  The question asks for the total number of visitors over 25 days, but only provides visitor numbers for two specific days: <fact1>703 visitors on the previous day</fact1> and <fact2>246 visitors on the current day</fact2>.  To answer, we need to assume a constant daily visitor rate, which is not explicitly stated in the problem.  This assumption is problematic and makes a precise answer unreliable.  However, if we *assume* an average daily attendance, we can attempt an approximation.  Adding the number of visitors from the previous day (<fact1>703</fact1>) and the current day (<fact2>246</fact2>) and dividing by 2 to get an average gives (703 + 246)/2 = 474.5.  Multiplying this average daily attendance by <fact3>25 days</fact3> gives 474.5 * 25 = 11862.5 visitors.  Since we cannot have half a visitor, we round this to approximately 11863.  Therefore, based on this flawed assumption, roughly 11863 people visited the Buckingham Palace within the 25 days. The answer is approximately {11863}.  **It's crucial to note that this answer is an approximation based on an unreliable assumption of consistent daily attendance.**

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has <fact3>415 baseball cards and Ace cards left</fact3>. How many more <fact1>baseball cards</fact1> than <fact2>Ace cards</fact2> does Nell have?

Answer: Nell initially had a total of <fact1>309</fact1> + <fact2>356</fact2> = 665 cards.  After giving some to Jeff, she has <fact3>415</fact3> cards left. This means she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards.  Let's say she gave away 'x' Ace cards. Then she gave away (250 - x) baseball cards.  She now has 415 - x Ace cards and 309 - (250 - x) = 59 + x baseball cards. To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has now, we subtract: (59 + x) - (415 - x) = 2x - 356.  We don't know exactly how many cards of each type she gave away, but we do know her starting numbers:  She started with <fact1>309 baseball cards</fact1> and <fact2>356 Ace cards</fact2>.  Therefore, she has 309 - 356 = -47 more baseball cards than Ace cards initially.

If there were <fact2>45 bird families</fact2> living near the mountain initially, how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?

Answer:  Initially, there were <fact2>45 bird families</fact2> near the mountain.  <fact1>86 bird families</fact1> flew away. The number of bird families that stayed behind is the difference between the initial number and the number that flew away: <fact2>45</fact2>  (initial families) - <fact1>86</fact1> (families that flew away).

To correctly interpret this, let's assume that the initial number of families was a total.  Then the number of families that stayed is 45 - 86 = -41, meaning 41 more families left than stayed.

If Matthew gave equal numbers of <fact3>crackers and cakes</fact3> to his <fact4>2 friends</fact4>, how many cakes did each person eat?

Answer: Matthew gave equal numbers of <fact3>crackers and cakes</fact3> to his <fact4>2 friends</fact4>.  To find out how many cakes each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of items (crackers and cakes) he gave away. Since he had <fact1>29 crackers</fact1> and <fact2>30 cakes</fact2>, the lower number determines how many of each item he could equally distribute; hence, he gave away 29 items in total.  Therefore, each friend received 29 / <fact4>2</fact4> = 14.5 items. However, the question asks how many *cakes* each person ate. Because the number of cakes (30) is slightly greater than the number of crackers (29) and items must be equally distributed,  Matthew must have distributed 14 cakes and 15 crackers, or 15 cakes and 14 crackers.  Since we are only interested in the number of cakes, we must equally distribute the items which would give each friend 14 cakes and 14.5 crackers.  Since one cannot eat half a cracker, each friend received approximately 14.5 cakes. However, since cakes are discrete, the number must be an integer, it seems likely that each friend received 14 cakes.  The answer is {14}.

She was able to make <fact1>6 necklaces</fact1> and she had <fact2>18 beads</fact2> left over. How many beads did each necklace need?

Answer: Emily made <fact1>6 necklaces</fact1> using a total number of beads, and she had <fact2>18 beads</fact2> left.  To find out how many beads were used per necklace, we divide the total number of beads used (which is the total number of beads minus the leftover beads) by the number of necklaces made.  Therefore, each necklace required  (Total beads - leftover beads) / Number of necklaces = (Total beads - 18) / 6 beads.  Since the question doesn't specify a total number of beads, we cannot calculate the exact number of beads per necklace.  However, if we assume the 18 beads are leftover after using *all* her beads initially, then we need more information.  If the 18 beads represent all the beads she started with, then each necklace would have required 0 beads and she would have 18 leftover.  More information is needed to accurately answer the question.

926,"Matthew had 24 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left, how many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?","Reformatted Question: Matthew had <fact1>24 crackers</fact1>. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his <fact2>3 friends</fact2> and still had <fact3>17 crackers left</fact3>, how many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?

Answer: Matthew started with <fact1>24 crackers</fact1> and ended up with <fact3>17 crackers left</fact3>.  This means he gave away <fact1>24</fact1> - <fact3>17</fact3> = 7 crackers. Since he gave an equal number to his <fact2>3 friends</fact2>, each friend received 7 / <fact2>3</fact2> = 2.33 crackers. However, since you can't give fractions of crackers, there must be an error in the problem statement.  The question states that Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his friends, implying a whole number of crackers per friend.  With 7 crackers given away, it's impossible to distribute them equally among 3 friends and have a whole number for each.  Therefore, the problem contains contradictory information.

927,"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?","Reformatted Question: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped <fact1>21 inches</fact1>. The grasshopper jumped <fact2>25 inches farther than the frog</fact2>, and the mouse jumped <fact3>16 inches lesser than the frog</fact3>. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?

Answer: The grasshopper jumped <fact1>21 inches</fact1>.  Since the grasshopper jumped <fact2>25 inches farther than the frog</fact2>, the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches.  (This is a negative value, indicating a potential error in the problem statement.  It's possible there's a mistake in the question's wording. Assuming a correction where the grasshopper jumped *less* than the frog).

Let's assume the question meant to say the grasshopper jumped 25 inches *less* than the frog.  In that case, the frog jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches.

The mouse jumped <fact3>16 inches lesser than the frog</fact3>, meaning the mouse jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches.

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 30 -21 = 9 inches farther than the mouse.

If we use the original problem statement (where the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog), and assume the frog jumped a positive distance, we cannot solve the problem with the given information. The frog would have jumped a negative distance which is not possible in a jumping contest.

The answer is {9}  (assuming the correction of the problem statement).  If the original statement is correct, then the problem is internally inconsistent.
