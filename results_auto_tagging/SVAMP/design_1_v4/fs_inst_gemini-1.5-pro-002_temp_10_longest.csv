If he had <fact2>13 crackers</fact2> and <fact3>15 cakes</fact3> initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?

Answer: This question seems to be flawed.  It states Matthew gave *equal* numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend.  He started with <fact2>13 crackers</fact2> and <fact3>15 cakes</fact3>.  Since he has unequal amounts to begin with, he cannot give equal amounts of each to his <fact1>28 friends</fact1> unless he throws some away or eats some himself (which isn't mentioned).  If he gave away as many equal sets of crackers and cakes as possible, he could give 13 sets (limited by the number of crackers). This would mean 1 cracker and 1 cake per person for 13 people, with 15 - 13 = 2 cakes left over and 28 - 13 = 15 friends not receiving anything. If the question is asking how many total snacks each person ate, and assuming the remaining friends didn't receive anything, the 13 friends ate 1+1=2 snacks each.  The question needs clarification.

Answer: Jerry started with <fact1>7 action figures</fact1>. He removed <fact2>10</fact2>, meaning he was left with 7 - 10 = -3 figures.

While <fact2>15 customers left</fact2>, he got <fact3>14 new customers</fact3>. How many customers does he still have?
Answer: The waiter initially had <fact1>12 customers</fact1>.  Since <fact2>15 customers left</fact2>, this leaves him with 12 - 15 = -3 customers.  However, it is not possible for a waiter to have negative 3 customers. The question states that <fact2>15 customers left</fact2> the initial 12 customers, which implies that the number of leaving customers couldn't exceed the initial number. However, he then got <fact3>14 new customers</fact3>, so the total number of customers he has is -3 + 14 = 11.

Since Marco picked <fact2>19 pounds</fact2> himself, his dad must have picked <fact1>4</fact1> - <fact2>19</fact2> = -15 pounds. This doesn't make sense in a real-world context (you can't pick negative pounds of strawberries), so there must be an error in the problem.  Assuming the combined weight is a typo and should be a larger number (perhaps 40 or 41 pounds), we proceed conceptually.  If Marco picked <fact2>19 pounds</fact2> and his dad picked -15 pounds (following the numbers given), Marco picked <fact2>19</fact2> - (-15) = 34 pounds *more* than his dad.  However, since the problem likely contains an error, there is no realistic solution.

Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,"Reformatted Question: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed <fact1>22 pounds</fact1>. On the way back, Marco's dad found <fact2>30 more pounds</fact2> of strawberries. <fact3>Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds</fact3>. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?

Answer:
Together, Marco and his dad initially picked <fact1>22 pounds</fact1> of strawberries.  Since <fact3>Marco now has 36 pounds</fact3>, his dad must have given him 36 - <fact1>22</fact1> = 14 pounds. This means the dad originally had <fact1>22</fact1> - (36-<fact1>22</fact1>) = 8 pounds.  Then he found <fact2>30 more pounds</fact2>.  So now his dad has 8 + <fact2>30</fact2> = 38 pounds of strawberries. The answer is {38}.

If she had grown <fact2>3 trees</fact2> initially, how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?
Answer: Haley initially had <fact2>3 trees</fact2>.  Since <fact1>13 trees died</fact1> in the typhoon, and she only had <fact2>3 trees</fact2> to begin with, this means all <fact2>3</fact2> trees died.

355,Adam could fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room. His room has could hold 8 action figures. How many total shelves did his room have?,"Reformatted Question: Adam could fit <fact1>10 action figures on each shelf</fact1> in his room. His room has could hold <fact2>8 action figures</fact2>. How many total shelves did his room have?
Answer: This question appears to have a typo. It states Adam can fit <fact1>10 action figures *on* each shelf</fact1>, but his room can only hold <fact2>8 action figures total</fact2>.  If the room can only hold 8 figures, and each shelf holds 10, he doesn't have enough figures to fill a single shelf. He likely has a fraction of a shelf, specifically 8/10 = 0.8 or 4/5 of a shelf, but in practical terms, he doesn't have any shelves being used for figures as there aren't enough figures.  If the question meant to say he *has* 80 figures, then with <fact1>10 per shelf</fact1>, he'd have 80/10 = 8 shelves. As written, however, the question implies he does not have any full shelves. The intended answer might be {1} assuming a single shelf is always present regardless of the number of action figures. Or {0} if interpreted as no shelf being used since it can't hold the minimum amount of action figures. As it stands, the question is flawed.

Answer:
Since Marco and his dad collected <fact1>24 pounds</fact1> of strawberries together, and Marco lost <fact2>9 pounds</fact2>, they had 24 - 9 = 15 pounds left.  Since Marco's remaining strawberries weighed <fact3>3 pounds</fact3>, his dad's strawberries must have weighed 15 - 3 = 12 pounds. The answer is {12}.

How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?

Answer:
Since <fact1>Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven</fact1>, and <fact3>Steven has 16 peaches</fact3>, Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.  <fact2>Jake also has 18 more peaches than Jill</fact2>, meaning Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. This doesn't make real-world sense (you can't have negative peaches), suggesting there's an issue with the problem itself.  However, sticking to the numerical relationships presented, Steven has 16 peaches and Jill has -11, so Steven has 16 - (-11) = 27 more peaches than Jill. So the answer, based on the given numerical relationships is {27}.  It's important to note that a negative number of peaches is illogical in a real-world context.

512,"David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups, how many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?","Reformatted Question: David did <fact1>56 more push-ups</fact1> than Zachary in gym class today. If <fact2>David did 38 push-ups</fact2>, how many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?


Answer:
Since <fact2>David did 38 push-ups</fact2> and did <fact1>56 more than Zachary</fact1>, Zachary did 38 - 56 = -28 push-ups. This doesn't make sense in a real-world scenario, as you can't do negative push-ups.  However, if the question meant David did 56 push-ups *more* than Zachary, then it means that Zachary did 38 -56 = -18 push ups. Again, in the real world this is not possible, it could have meant that Zachary did zero pushups. Assuming Zachary must have done at least 0 pushups and David did 38 pushups and David did 56 more than Zachary, this implies that the information is contradicting each other. 

However, if we are considering absolute number (disregarding the fact one can't do negative push-ups), then altogether they did 38 + (-28) = 10 push-ups.  The answer is {10}. (Mathematically correct but not logically correct).

After some left he still had <fact2>4 customers</fact2>. How many more customers stayed behind than those that left?
Answer:
The waiter initially had <fact1>3 customers</fact1>. Since he now has <fact2>4 customers</fact2>, this means 4 - 3 = 1 customer stayed behind *and* 3 + 1 = 4 more customers must have arrived. However, the question doesn't specify that new customers arrived and asks how many more *stayed* which would be <fact2>4</fact2>.  Since we're comparing how many more *stayed* than *left* and we only know the waiter *ended* with 4, the problem is flawed.  You can't determine how many left without knowing how many arrived.

How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?

Answer:
Initially, there were <fact1>21 roses</fact1>. Jessica threw away <fact2>34 roses</fact2>.  Since she threw away more than she initially had, she must have added some roses before discarding them.  To find out how many she added before discarding, we calculate the difference between the number she discarded (<fact2>34</fact2>) and the initial number (<fact1>21</fact1>): <fact2>34</fact2> - <fact1>21</fact1> = 13.  This means 13 roses must have been added before she threw any away.

After discarding the roses, she had 0. Then she added some more, and ended up with <fact3>15 roses</fact3>. This means she added 15 roses after discarding the initial batch.

In total, she added 13 + 15 = 28 roses.  She threw away <fact2>34 roses</fact2>. The difference between the number she threw away and the number she cut and added is <fact2>34</fact2> - 28 = 6. So she threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden. The answer is {6}.

927,"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?","Reformatted Question: The grasshopper, the frog, and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped <fact1>21 inches</fact1>. The grasshopper jumped <fact2>25 inches farther</fact2> than the frog, and the mouse jumped <fact3>16 inches lesser</fact3> than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?

Answer:
The grasshopper jumped <fact1>21 inches</fact1>. Since the grasshopper jumped <fact2>25 inches farther</fact2> than the frog, the frog jumped <fact1>21</fact1> - <fact2>25</fact2> = -4 inches. (This suggests there's an issue with the problem as a frog cannot jump negative inches. However, we'll continue with the calculation as per the given information).

The mouse jumped <fact3>16 inches lesser</fact3> than the frog, so the mouse jumped -4 - <fact3>16</fact3> = -20 inches (again, a negative value, indicating a problem with the question's premise).

The question asks how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse.  The difference is <fact1>21</fact1> - (-20) = 21 + 20 = 41 inches. The answer is {41}.
