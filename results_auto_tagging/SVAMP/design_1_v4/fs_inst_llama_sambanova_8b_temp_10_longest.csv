36,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?","Reformatted Question: After eating a hearty meal, they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that <fact1>703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day</fact1>. If there were <fact2>246 visitors on that day</fact2>, how many visited the Buckingham palace within <fact3>25 days</fact3>?

Answer: If there were <fact2>246 visitors</fact2> on the previous day, and <fact1>703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day</fact1>, then the difference between these two numbers, which is <fact1>703</fact1>−<fact2>246</fact2> = 457 visitors, represents the number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace on the day before the previous day. This means that the total number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day and the day before the previous day is <fact2>246</fact2>+<fact1>457</fact1> = 703 visitors. To find the number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace within 25 days, we need to find the average number of visitors per day, which is <fact1>703</fact1>/<fact3>25</fact3> = 28.12 visitors per day. Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we round down to 28 visitors per day. To find the total number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace within 25 days, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days, which is <fact3>28</fact3>*<fact3>25</fact3> = 700 visitors. However, this is not the correct answer, because it doesn't take into account the visitors who came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. To find the correct answer, we need to add the visitors who came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day, which is <fact1>703</fact1>, to the total number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace within 25 days, which is <fact3>700</fact3>, to get the final answer, which is <fact3>700</fact3>+<fact1>703</fact1> = 1403 visitors."

There are <fact2>58 students</fact2> in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are <fact3>2 seats on each school bus</fact3>, how many buses are needed to take the trip?

Answer: To determine the number of buses needed, we first need to find out how many students are in the school. We know that there are <fact2>58 students</fact2> in the school and <fact1>87 classrooms</fact1> with the same number of students in each classroom. This means we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to find out how many students are in each classroom.

Since we are given the total number of students, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to find out how many students are in each classroom. However, this is not necessary. We can directly use the total number of students to find the number of buses needed. If each classroom has the same number of students, we can simply divide the total number of students by the number of students per bus to find the number of buses needed. In this case, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus to find the number of buses needed.

If there were <fact2>45 bird families</fact2> living near the mountain initially, how many more <fact3>bird families</fact3> flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?
Answer: To find the number of bird families that stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the initial number of bird families. The number of bird families that flew away is <fact1>86</fact1>, and the initial number of bird families is <fact2>45</fact2>. Therefore, the number of bird families that stayed behind is <fact2>45</fact2>−<fact1>86</fact1> = -41. However, since we can't have a negative number of bird families, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The number of bird families that stayed behind is actually the difference between the initial number of bird families and the number of bird families that flew away. Since we are looking for the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and the number that stayed behind, we can simply subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number of bird families that flew away. The number of bird families that stayed behind is <fact2>45</fact2>, and the number of bird families that flew away is <fact1>86</fact1>. Therefore, the number of bird families that flew away is <fact1>86</fact1>−<fact2>45</fact2> = 41. However, we are looking for the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and the number that stayed behind. Therefore, the correct answer is <fact1>86</fact1>−<fact2>45</fact2> = 41."

If there were <fact3>188 visitors</fact3> the previous day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within <fact4>57 days</fact4>?

Answer: To determine the total number of visitors within 57 days, we need to find the average number of visitors per day. We know that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day and 188 visitors came the previous day. This means that the average number of visitors per day is (557 + 188) / 2 = 372.5. However, we are interested in the total number of visitors within 57 days, so we need to multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days: 372.5 * 57 = 21212.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we round down to the nearest whole number: 21212."

It took <fact3>frank 664 days</fact3> to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?

Answer: The book had <fact1>2 chapters</fact1> and it took <fact3>frank 664 days</fact3> to finish the book. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took to finish the book. Since each chapter has <fact2>405 pages</fact2>, the total number of pages is <fact1>2</fact1> * <fact2>405</fact2> = 810 pages. However, the number of pages is not relevant to the number of chapters read per day. Therefore, we can simply divide the total number of chapters by the number of days: <fact1>2</fact1> / <fact3>664</fact3> = 0.003 (approximately). However, this is not the answer we are looking for. The question asks for the number of chapters read per day, which is the number of chapters divided by the number of days."

If she had grown <fact2>3 trees</fact2> initially, how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?
Answer: Haley initially had <fact2>3 trees</fact2> and <fact1>13 trees</fact1> died in the typhoon. To find out how many trees survived, we need to subtract the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees. Therefore, the number of trees that survived is <fact2>3</fact2>−<fact1>13</fact1> = -10. However, since we cannot have a negative number of trees, we can assume that the question is asking for the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived. In this case, the number of trees that survived is not provided, but we can still find the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived. The number of trees that died is <fact1>13</fact1> and the number of trees that survived is <fact2>3</fact2>.

The recipe calls for <fact1>5 cups of sugar</fact1> and <fact2>14 cups of flour</fact2>. She already put in <fact3>11 cups of flour</fact3>. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
Answer: Mary already put in <fact3>11 cups of flour</fact3> (according to the question, <fact3>She already put in 11 cups of flour</fact3>), which is less than the total amount of flour required, <fact2>14 cups of flour</fact2>. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we need to find the difference between the total amount of sugar required and the total amount of flour required. The total amount of sugar required is <fact1>5 cups of sugar</fact1> and the total amount of flour required is <fact2>14 cups of flour</fact2>. However, we do not know how much flour she has already put in, which is <fact3>11 cups of flour</fact3>. Since we are asked to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour she needs to add now, we need to compare the amount of sugar required with the amount of flour she has already put in, which is <fact3>11 cups of flour</fact3>. Therefore, we need to find the difference between the total amount of sugar required, <fact1>5 cups of sugar</fact1>, and the amount of flour she has already put in, <fact3>11 cups of flour</fact3>. The difference is <fact1>5</fact1>−<fact3>11</fact3> = -6 cups of flour. However, since we are asked to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour she needs to add now, we need to consider the absolute value of the difference, which is <fact1>6</fact1> cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour than cups of sugar."

505,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that, how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?","Reformatted Question: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that <fact1>705 visitors</fact1> came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were <fact2>191 visitors</fact2> the previous day and <fact3>457 visitors</fact3> the day before that, how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous <fact4>245 days</fact4>?

Answer: To find the difference in visitors between the current day and the previous 245 days, we need to find the total number of visitors for the previous 245 days and subtract it from the number of visitors on the current day. Since we know the number of visitors for the previous two days, we can assume that the number of visitors for the previous 245 days is approximately the same as the number of visitors for the previous two days. However, this assumption is not entirely accurate, as the number of visitors may have varied over the previous 245 days. Nevertheless, we can use this assumption to make an estimate. The number of visitors for the previous two days is <fact2>191</fact2> + <fact3>457</fact3> = <fact5>648</fact5> visitors. To find the number of visitors for the previous 245 days, we can multiply this number by 245: <fact5>648</fact5> * <fact4>245</fact4> = <fact6>158,880</fact6> visitors. Now, we can subtract this number from the number of visitors on the current day to find the difference: <fact1>705</fact1> - <fact6>158,880</fact6> = -<fact7>158,175</fact7> visitors. However, this is not the correct answer, as we cannot have a negative number of visitors. The correct answer is actually the absolute value of this number, which is <fact7>158,175</fact7> visitors."

Answer: Since David did <fact2>38 push-ups</fact2> and he did <fact1>56 more push-ups</fact1> than Zachary, we can find out how many push-ups Zachary did by subtracting 56 from 38. However, since 56 is more than 38, it would make more sense to subtract 38 from 56 to get the amount of push-ups that Zachary did. Therefore, Zachary did <fact2>56</fact2>−<fact1>38</fact1>=18 push-ups. To find the total number of push-ups, we need to add the number of push-ups that Zachary did to the number of push-ups that David did.

602,The Razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?,"Reformatted Question: The Razorback shop makes <fact1>$115 dollars off each jersey</fact1> and <fact2>$25 off each t-shirt</fact2>. During the <fact3>Arkansas and Texas tech game</fact3> they sold <fact4>113 t-shirts</fact4> and <fact5>78 jerseys</fact5>. How much more does a <fact6>jersey cost than a t-shirt</fact6>?

Answer: To find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys and t-shirts, then find the difference. The Razorback shop sold <fact5>78 jerseys</fact5> for <fact1>$115 dollars each</fact1>, which is <fact5>78</fact5> * <fact1>$115</fact1> = $<fact7>8970</fact7>. They also sold <fact4>113 t-shirts</fact4> for <fact2>$25 dollars each</fact2>, which is <fact4>113</fact4> * <fact2>$25</fact2> = $<fact8>2825</fact8>. The total revenue from jerseys is <fact7>$8970</fact7> and from t-shirts is <fact8>$2825</fact8>. To find the difference in cost, we subtract the revenue from t-shirts from the revenue from jerseys, which is <fact7>$8970</fact7> - <fact8>$2825</fact8> = $<fact9>6145</fact9>. Since we are looking for the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, we divide this difference by the number of t-shirts sold, which is <fact4>113</fact4>, to get the difference per t-shirt. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. Instead, we need to find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt. We can do this by dividing the difference in revenue by the number of jerseys sold, which is <fact5>78</fact5>. This will give us the difference in cost per jersey. The difference in revenue is <fact7>$8970</fact7> - <fact8>$2825</fact8> = $<fact9>6145</fact9>. The difference in cost per jersey is <fact9>$6145</fact9> / <fact5>78</fact5> = $<fact10>78.98</fact10> (rounded to two decimal places)."

The program could seat <fact3>44 people</fact3>, how many people were present in the program?
Answer: To find the total number of people present in the program, we need to add the number of parents and pupils. Since the program could seat 44 people, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of parents and pupils.

Each basket has <fact2>10 red peaches</fact2> and <fact3>18 green peaches</fact3>. How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
Answer: To find the total number of peaches, we need to add the number of red peaches and the number of green peaches in each basket.

Answer: To find the number of sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest, we first need to find out how many sacks are harvested in total.

An additional <fact3>22 kids</fact3> from outside the county attended the camp. About how many kids are in Lawrence county?
Answer: To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we need to add the number of kids who went to camp and the number of kids who stayed home. This is because the two groups are mutually exclusive, meaning that a kid can either go to camp or stay home, but not both. So, the total number of kids in Lawrence county is <fact1>610769</fact1>+<fact2>590796</fact2>=<fact4>1201565</fact4> kids. However, we also need to subtract the 22 kids who are from outside the county, because they are not part of the Lawrence county population.

Rebecca has <fact3>8 eggs</fact3> and <fact4>6 marbles</fact4>. How many eggs will each group have?

Answer: The question is asking about the number of eggs per group, but the question does not mention the number of marbles in relation to the number of eggs. The number of marbles (6) is irrelevant to the question about the number of eggs per group. The relevant information is that Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 4 groups and she has 8 eggs. To find the number of eggs per group, we need to divide the total number of eggs (8) by the number of groups (4). So, 8 eggs / 4 groups = 2 eggs per group. The answer is {2}."

Answer: Jack sent <fact4>8 letters</fact4> in the afternoon and <fact2>2 letters</fact2> in the morning, making a total of <fact4>8</fact4>+<fact2>2</fact2>=10 letters. However, the question asks for the number of emails Jack sent, not the number of letters.

We can conclude that Jack received a total of <fact1>4</fact1>+<fact3>6</fact3>=10 emails, but the question asks for the number of emails Jack sent. Since the number of emails Jack sent is not explicitly stated, we can infer that the question is asking for the number of emails Jack sent, which is the same as the number of emails he received. Therefore, Jack sent a total of 10 emails."

640,Dan has $ 2. He bought some candy bar for $ 6 each one costing $ 3. How many candy bar did he buy?,"Reformatted Question: Dan has <fact1>$2</fact1> and bought some candy bars for <fact2>$6 each</fact2>, but each candy bar actually costs <fact3>$3</fact3>. How many candy bars did he buy?
Answer: Dan has <fact1>$2</fact1> and wants to buy candy bars that cost <fact2>$6 each</fact2>, but the price of each candy bar is actually <fact3>$3</fact3>. This means he can buy <fact1>2</fact1>/<fact3>3</fact3>=2/3 of a candy bar, but he only has <fact1>$2</fact1> to spend. Since he can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he can only buy <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar if the candy bar cost <fact2>$6</fact2>, but he can actually buy <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar for <fact3>$3</fact3> which is the actual cost of the candy bar. The question is asking for the number of candy bars Dan can buy for <fact2>$6</fact2> each. Since Dan can only buy a fraction of a candy bar for <fact2>$6</fact2> each, he can only buy <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar for <fact2>$6</fact2> each, but the candy bar actually cost <fact3>$3</fact3>. If the candy bar actually cost <fact3>$3</fact3>, then Dan can buy <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar for <fact3>$3</fact3> and <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar cost <fact1>2/3</fact1>*<fact3>$3</fact3>=<fact4>$2</fact4>.

Since Dan has <fact1>$2</fact1> to spend and <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar cost <fact4>$2</fact4>, Dan can buy <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar with the money he has. If Dan can buy <fact1>2/3</fact1> of a candy bar with the money he has, then he can buy <fact1>2</fact1> a whole candy bar with the money he has. The answer is {0}."

How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
Answer: Mary is baking a cake and the recipe calls for <fact2>11 cups of sugar</fact2> and <fact1>9 cups of flour</fact1>. She has already put in <fact3>4 cups of flour</fact3>, which means she still needs <fact1>9</fact1>−<fact3>4</fact3>=5 cups of flour. Since she needs to add more flour, she will need to add more sugar as well. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we need to find out how many cups of sugar she has already added. However, the question does not provide this information. But it does provide the total amount of sugar required, which is <fact2>11 cups</fact2>. Therefore, we can assume that she has added some amount of sugar, but we do not know how much. However, we can find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add compared to the amount of flour she needs to add. Since she needs to add <fact1>5 cups of flour</fact1> and the recipe calls for <fact2>11 cups of sugar</fact2>, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add for every cup of flour she adds. The proportion is <fact2>11 cups of sugar</fact2> to <fact1>9 cups of flour</fact1> is equal to <fact4>x cups of sugar</fact4> to <fact1>5 cups of flour</fact1>. We can then solve for x to find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add for every cup of flour she adds. The proportion is <fact2>11/9=x/5</fact2>. Cross-multiplying, we get <fact2>55=9x</fact2>. Dividing both sides by 9, we get <fact2>6.11=x</fact2>. Therefore, for every cup of flour she adds, she needs to add approximately 6.11 cups of sugar. Since she needs to add <fact1>5 cups of flour</fact1>, she needs to add approximately <fact4>5*6.11=30.55 cups of sugar</fact4>. Therefore, she needs to add approximately 30.55 cups of sugar."

Now, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus, which is <fact3>4422</fact3> / <fact3>6</fact3> = 736.6667. Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 737. Therefore, the answer is {737}."

If they sold <fact5>47 t-shirts</fact5> during the <fact2>Arkansas game</fact2>, how much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
Answer: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes <fact1>$87 dollars</fact1> off each t-shirt sold, and they sold a total of <fact4>95 t-shirts</fact4>. Since they sold <fact5>47 t-shirts</fact5> during the <fact2>Arkansas game</fact2>, they must have sold <fact4>95</fact4>−<fact5>47</fact5>=48 t-shirts during the <fact3>Texas tech game</fact3>. Therefore, they made <fact5>48</fact5> * <fact1>$87 dollars</fact1> = <fact6>$4140</fact6> from selling the t-shirts during the <fact3>Texas tech game</fact3>.

687,3 birds were sitting on the fence. 2 more birds and 6 more storks came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?,"Reformatted Question: 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 2 more birds and 6 more storks came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?
Answer: Initially, there were <fact1>3 birds</fact1> on the fence. Then, <fact2 more birds and 6 more storks came to join them</fact2>, which means there are now <fact1>3</fact1>+<fact2>2</fact2>=5 birds. However, the question asks about the difference between the number of storks and birds, not the total number of birds. Since there are <fact2>6 more storks</fact2> than birds, and there are <fact1>5 birds</fact1> in total, there must be <fact1>5</fact1>+<fact2>6</fact2>=11 storks. Therefore, the difference between the number of storks and birds is <fact2>11</fact2>−<fact1>5</fact1>=6. The answer is {6}."

If she played tag with <fact3>12 more kids</fact3> on <fact2>Monday</fact2> than on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>, how many kids did she play with on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>?

Answer: Since Julia played tag with <fact1>12 more kids</fact1> on <fact2>Monday</fact2> than on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>, we can say that the number of kids she played with on <fact2>Monday</fact2> is <fact1>12</fact1> + the number of kids she played with on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>. We know that she played with <fact1>16 kids</fact1> on <fact2>Monday</fact2>, so we can write the equation: <fact1>16</fact1> = <fact1>12</fact1> + x, where x is the number of kids she played with on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>. To find x, we can subtract <fact1>12</fact1> from both sides of the equation: x = <fact1>16</fact1> - <fact1>12</fact1>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact1>4</fact1>. Therefore, Julia played with <fact1>4</fact1> kids on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>."

Adam has <fact4>8 more apples than Jackie</fact4>. How many apples does <fact5>He</fact5> have?
Answer: Let's denote the number of apples that Jackie has as x. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Adam has x+8 apples. The total number of apples that Adam and Jackie have is 12, so we can set up the equation: x + (x+8) = 12. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 8 = 12. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2. This means that Jackie has 2 apples, and Adam has 2+8 = 10 apples. Since He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do, and Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples, He must have 12+9 = 21 apples."

Her dad gave her <fact2>$6</fact2> more dollars. If she spent <fact3>$4</fact3>, how much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?
Answer: To find out how much more money Gwen received from her dad than she did from her mom, we need to first determine how much money she received from her dad and her mom in total. Gwen's mom gave her <fact1>$3</fact1> and she received <fact2>$6</fact2> from her dad. So, she received a total of <fact1>$3</fact1>+<fact2>$6</fact2>=<fact3>$9</fact3> from both her mom and dad.

How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?

Answer: Since the question asks how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to know how many cups of sugar she already put in. According to the question, she put in <fact3>4 cups of sugar</fact3> (since it says <fact3>She already put in 4 cups of sugar</fact3>). The recipe calls for <fact2>6 cups of sugar</fact2>, so she needs <fact2>6</fact2>−<fact3>4</fact3>=2 more cups of sugar.

If there are <fact3>281 more girls than boys</fact3>, how many pupils are there in that school?
Answer: Let's denote the number of boys as B. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, the number of girls is B + 281. We know that the total number of pupils is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys, which is 868 + B. We can set up an equation based on this information: B + (B + 281) = 868 + B. Simplifying the equation, we get 2B + 281 = 868 + B. Subtracting B from both sides, we get B + 281 = 868. Subtracting 281 from both sides, we get B = 587. Therefore, the number of boys is 587. To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of girls and the number of boys: 868 + 587 = 1455. The answer is {1455}."

There, Rachel learned that <fact2>512 visitors</fact2> came to the <fact1>Buckingham palace</fact1> that day. If there were <fact3>471 visitors</fact3> the previous day and <fact4>808 visitors</fact4> the day before that, how many visited the <fact1>Buckingham palace</fact1> within the past <fact5>89 days</fact5>?

Answer: To find the total number of visitors within the past 89 days, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day. We can do this by adding the number of visitors for the past 3 days and dividing by 3. The number of visitors for the past 3 days is <fact2>512</fact2> + <fact3>471</fact3> + <fact4>808</fact4> = <fact6>1791</fact6>. The average number of visitors per day is <fact6>1791</fact6> / <fact7>3</fact7> = <fact8>597</fact8>. Now, we can multiply the average number of visitors per day by the total number of days to find the total number of visitors within the past 89 days. The total number of visitors is <fact8>597</fact8> * <fact9>89</fact9> = <fact10>52973</fact10>. The answer is {52973}."

Answer: He found out that they harvest <fact1>44 sacks of ripe oranges</fact1> and <fact2>25 sacks of unripe oranges</fact2> per day, which means they harvest <fact1>44</fact1>−<fact2>25</fact2>=19 more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges per day. The answer is {19}."
931,"White t - shirts can be purchased in packages of 53. If mom buys 57 packages of white t - shirts and 34 trousers, how many white t - shirts will she have?","Reformatted Question: If mom buys <fact1>57 packages of white t - shirts</fact1> and <fact2>34 trousers</fact2>, how many white t - shirts will she have?
Answer: If mom buys <fact1>57 packages of white t - shirts</fact1>, and each package contains a certain number of white t - shirts, then she will have <fact1>57</fact1> times that number of white t - shirts. Since the question does not specify the number of white t - shirts per package, we can assume that each package contains a fixed number of white t - shirts. However, the question does mention that mom also buys <fact2>34 trousers</fact2>, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the number of white t - shirts and the number of trousers. Therefore, we can only conclude that mom will have <fact1>57</fact1> times the number of white t - shirts per package. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact number of white t - shirts she will have without more information."

If he has <fact1>27 books</fact1> and <fact2>80 magazines</fact2> in each of his <fact3>23 bookshelves</fact3>, how many books does he have in total?
Answer: The question is asking for the total number of books Bryan has, but it only mentions the number of books and magazines in each bookshelf. Since we are only interested in the number of books, we can ignore the number of magazines. Therefore, we only need to consider the number of books in each bookshelf, which is <fact1>27 books</fact1>. Since there are <fact3>23 bookshelves</fact3> in total, the total number of books is <fact1>27</fact1> * <fact3>23</fact3> = 621 books. The answer is {621}."

If you read <fact4>11 of the books</fact4> and watched <fact5>40 of the movies</fact5>, how many more books than movies are there in the '<fact3> crazy silly school </fact3>' series?
Answer: There are <fact2>15 different books</fact2> in total and <fact1>14 different movies</fact1> in total, and you read <fact4>11 of the books</fact4> and watched <fact5>40 of the movies</fact5>. The number of books you read is less than the total number of books, and the number of movies you watched is less than the total number of movies. Therefore, the number of books you read is 11, and the number of movies you watched is 40. Since there are more books than movies in total, the difference between the total number of books and the total number of movies is the number of books you read minus the number of movies you watched. Therefore, the number of more books than movies is <fact4>11</fact4>−<fact5>40</fact5>=−29. However, since the question asks for the number of more books than movies, and the difference is negative, it means that there are more movies than books.

If <fact2>406 people</fact2> visited the Buckingham palace within the past <fact3>327 days</fact3>, how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?

Answer: To find the number of visitors on the previous day, we need to find the average number of visitors per day and then subtract the number of visitors on the current day.

If <fact2>829 people</fact2> visited the Buckingham palace within the past <fact3>85 days</fact3>, how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?

Answer: To find the number of visitors on that day, we need to divide the total number of visitors within the past 85 days by the number of days. This is because the total number of visitors is evenly distributed over the 85 days. 

If <fact2>829 people</fact2> visited the Buckingham palace within the past <fact3>85 days</fact3>, then the average number of visitors per day is <fact2>829</fact2>/<fact3>85</fact3> = 9.7. 

However, the question asks for the number of visitors on that day, which is the previous day of the visit to the Buckingham palace. Therefore, we should round down to the nearest whole number, which is 9."

There are also <fact3>36 teachers</fact3>, how many pupils are there in that school?
Answer: To find the total number of pupils, we need to add the number of girls and boys. According to the information, there are <fact1>308 girls</fact1> and <fact2>318 boys</fact2>, so the total number of pupils is <fact1>308</fact1>+<fact2>318</fact2>=626."

Answer: Since Katie had <fact2>63 ds games</fact2> and her friends had <fact1>57 games</fact1>, to find out how many more games Katie has, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has. So, we calculate <fact2>63</fact2>−<fact1>57</fact1> to find the difference. The answer is {6}."

995,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?,"Reformatted Question: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted <fact1>36 seeds</fact1>. They put <fact2>12 seeds in each flower bed</fact2> and only <fact3>58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed</fact3>. How many flower beds did they have?
Answer: If they put <fact2>12 seeds in each flower bed</fact2> and only <fact3>58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed</fact3>, it means that each flower bed has more than 12 seeds. However, the total number of seeds they planted is <fact1>36 seeds</fact1>. Since each flower bed has more than 12 seeds, we can't divide 36 by 12 to get the number of flower beds. Instead, we need to find out how many seeds grew into flowers in total. Since each flower bed has 58 seeds that grew into flowers, we can divide the total number of seeds they planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed to get the number of flower beds. However, we are given that 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, but we don't know how many seeds grew into flowers in total. We can't divide 36 by 58 to get the number of flower beds. However, we can divide the total number of seeds they planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed and then multiply the result by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed to get the total number of seeds that grew into flowers. Then we can divide the total number of seeds they planted by the total number of seeds that grew into flowers to get the number of flower beds. The total number of seeds that grew into flowers is 36 * 58 / 12 = 221. The total number of seeds they planted is 36. The number of flower beds is 36 / 58 = 0.62. However, we can't have a fraction of a flower bed. The question states that they put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. This means that each flower bed has more than 12 seeds, but the total number of seeds they planted is 36. This is a contradiction. The question is inconsistent."

Answer: If <fact3>82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding</fact3> from the original <fact2>75 alligators</fact2>, then the number of alligators not hiding is <fact2>75</fact2>−<fact3>19</fact3>=56. The answer is {56}."
997,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?,"Reformatted Question: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted <fact1>55 seeds</fact1>. They put <fact2>15 seeds in each flower bed</fact2> and only <fact3>60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed</fact3>. How many flowers did they grow?
Answer: Paige and her mom planted <fact1>55 seeds</fact1> in total, but only <fact3>60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed</fact3>, which means they planted more than one flower bed. Since they put <fact2>15 seeds in each flower bed</fact2>, they must have planted <fact1>55</fact1>/<fact2>15</fact2> = 3.67 flower beds, but since you can't have a fraction of a flower bed, this means they planted at least 4 flower beds. However, the question states that only <fact3>60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed</fact3>, which means the number of flowers they grew is <fact3>60</fact3> times the number of flower beds they planted. Since they planted at least 4 flower beds, the minimum number of flowers they grew is <fact3>60</fact3> * 4 = 240 flowers."
