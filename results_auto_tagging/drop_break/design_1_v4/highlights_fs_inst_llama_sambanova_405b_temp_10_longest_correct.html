They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women.

However, the passage only provides the number of people for these groups, not their percentage representation.

However, note that <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">Hispanic or Latino</fact8> is not a racial group, but rather an ethnic group. Therefore, the second biggest racial group is actually <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">African American (2,834)</fact2>. The smallest racial groups in order are: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Pacific Islander (165)</fact5>, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Asian (356)</fact4>. Therefore, the second smallest racial group is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Asian (356)</fact4>.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>81/ Reformatted Question:</strong> In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 May 1563</fact1>, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">13 August 1563</fact2>, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared.

June has 30 days, July has 31 days, and from the start of August to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">13 August</fact2> is 13 days. Therefore, the total number of days is 1 + 30 + 31 + 13 = 75. So the answer is {75}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[75.0]</div></div>

Gago was killed in action and his entire company was wiped out. Advancing forces faced another ferocious defensive attack between the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and the Nallur Weerakaliyamman temple.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>142/ Reformatted Question:</strong> When Matthias Corvinus died from a stroke on 6 April 1490, Frederick was able to regain the Austrian lands. However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg</fact1> with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">born in 1506</fact2>, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács, whereby King Louis II was killed.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>184/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Late in the 18th Century, Qing dynasty set about a momentous task, the creation of the Siku Quanshu. The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>204/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000</fact1>. In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000</fact2>. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the population of Acalan in 1525 was at least 10,000</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the population in 1553 was around 4,000</fact2>. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10,000</fact1> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4,000</fact2> = 6,000.

In the 2nd quarter, Jason McCourty would recover a blocked punt in the end zone sending the game to 10-0, followed up by Bironas nailing a 50-yard field goal for 13-0 and eventual halftime lead of 20-0 when Nate Washington ran for a 3-yard touchdown.  The Colts would manage to get on the board as <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Adam Vinatieri would kick a 22-yard field goal</fact1> for a 20-3 lead.  Donald Brown managed to increase his team's points with a 4-yard touchdown run for a 20-10 lead.  The Titans however wrapped the game up when Washington ran for a 14-yard touchdown for a final score of 27-10.With the loss, the Colts fell to 0-8. How many field goals did <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Vinatieri kick in the third quarter</fact2>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Vinatieri kicked a 22-yard field goal</fact1> but there is no information about which quarter it was in. However, since the passage states that the Colts got on the board with this field goal after the Titans had a 20-0 halftime lead, we can infer that Vinatieri's field goal was in the second half. Additionally, since the passage does not mention Vinatieri kicking any other field goals, we can conclude that Vinatieri kicked only 1 field goal in the second half. However, it is not explicitly stated that the field goal was in the third quarter. It could be either in the third or fourth quarter. But since there is no other information about the quarters, we can only conclude that Vinatieri kicked 1 field goal in the second half, but not specifically in the third quarter.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[1.0]</div></div>

The largest French ships of the period were the Soleil Royal and the Royal Louis. Each rated for 120 guns, they never carried their full complement. These ships were too large for practical purposes. The former only sailed on one campaign and was destroyed at La Hogue; the latter languished in port until sold in 1694. By the 1680s, French ship-design was at least equal to its English and Dutch counterparts, and by the Nine Years' War the French fleet had surpassed ships of the Royal Navy, whose designs stagnated in the 1690s. Innovation in the Royal Navy, however, did not cease.

In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld.

This means that for every 100 females, there were 173.2 males, so the number of females per 100 is 100, and the number of males per 100 is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">173.2</fact2>. Since we want to know how many more females there are than males, we need to subtract the number of males from the number of females. However, since the number of males is greater than the number of females, we will get a negative number. To get the correct answer, we need to subtract the number of females from the number of males and then multiply by -1. So, 100 - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">173.2</fact2> is -73.2. Then, multiplying by -1, we get 73.2. So the answer is {73.2}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[73.2, -73.2]</div></div>

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">between 5 and 9 March 1918</fact1> on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>331/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The popular uprising included large areas of Lower Bavaria, the Innviertel and eastern Bavaria. The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men</fact1>, but the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Austrians lost only about 40</fact2>. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1665-66</fact2> they built a seminary in Ayutthaya with the approval of King Narai, the Seminary of Saint Joseph. In 1669, Louis Laneau, Bishop of Motella, also a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, was named head of a Roman Catholic mission in mainland Southeast Asia, with his headquarters at Ayutthaya. They propagated the Christian faith and also took care of Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Thailand. Narai welcomed these missionaries, providing them with land for a church, a mission-house and a seminary. Bishops Lambert and Ballue established a Western hospital in Thailand in 1669 at Ayutthaya, with Father Laneau as the head doctor. The hospital provided medical care to about 200-300 people daily. During a 1670 trip to France, Pallu obtained from Louis XIV a letter to King Narai, which, together with a letter from the Pope, he remitted in Ayutthaya in October 1673 and which was received with great reverence.

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Nyaungshwe in February 1601</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603</fact2>, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma. In early 1606, his 7,000-strong forces took Theinni, Thibaw and Momeik but the king died during the campaign on 3 March 1606.

The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>466/ Reformatted Question:</strong> From <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">November 1943</fact1>, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief. In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">January 1944</fact2>, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>467/ Reformatted Question:</strong> All these problems came to a head on 1 June 1648, upon Alexei I's return to Moscow from the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra monastery. A crowd of Muscovites surrounded the Tsar and complained about the boyars and prikaz officials. Instead of hearing the petition, the royal bodyguards started dispersing the crowd, pushing them away from the Tsar. This unexpected reaction caused a major outbreak of anger among the people. On 2 June the insurgents burst into the Moscow Kremlin and demanded the surrender of Leontii Pleshcheyev , Duma diak Nazar Chistoy , boyar Boris Morozov  and his brother-in-law Pyotr Trakhaniotov . Morozov commanded the Streltsy  to drive the rioters out of the Kremlin, but they refused. When not acting as the Tsar's bodyguards, the musketeers held artisanal jobs in Moscow. This conflict of interest led them to side with the plight of the townsmen, stating that they, "...did not want to stand in antagonistic relations with the crowd for the sake of the traitor and tyrant Pleshcheyev." The people would not hear the Tsar's heartfelt pleas to spare Pleshceyev and, on June 3, Alexei surrendered the official. In their fervor, the crowd did not wait for Pleshcheyev to be executed instead, "...they cuggeled him so black and blue and with axes they cut him asunder like a fish, the pieces they let lie naked here and there." The rebels set fire to the White City and Kitai-gorod. They burned between <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">15,000 and 24,000 houses</fact1>; between <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1700 and 2000 people died</fact2> in the riot. The rioters split into two groups to target the most hated boyars, diaks, okolnichys, and merchants, killing Nazar Chistoy as he begged for mercy.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>470/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Several 16th century writers estimated the 1492 population of Hispaniola at over 1 million people. 20th century estimates of the figure range from 60,000 to 8,000,000, but center around the 500,000 to 1,000,000 range. Harsh enslavement by Spanish colonists, as well as redirection of food supplies and labor towards the colonists, had a devastating impact on both mortality and fertility over the first quarter century. Colonial administrators and Dominican and Hyeronimite priests observed that the search for gold and agrarian enslavement through the encomienda system were depressing population. Demographic data from two provinces in 1514 shows a low birth rate consistent with a 3.5% annual population decline. Just 14,000 Taínos survived in 1517. In 1503 the colony began to import Ethnic groups of Africa slaves after a charter was passed in 1501 allowing the import of slaves by Ferdinand and Isabel.

In addition, the passage mentions that Cologne endured <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">262 air raids</fact2> and that this question is asking about <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">261 air raids</fact4>, so it can be inferred that the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">261 air raids</fact4> did not include "Operation Millennium". To find the answer, we need to subtract the amount of explosives dropped during "Operation Millennium" from the total amount of bombs dropped on the city. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44,923.2 tons</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1,455 tons</fact3> = 43,468.2 tons.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>553/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Charles V returned to Spain on July 16, 1522.  Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically.  Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much. Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1.  The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">293 comuneros</fact1>, a small figure given the huge number of rebels.  Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">293 excluded from the pardon</fact1>.  More pardons were issued later, after pressure from the Cortes; by 1527, the repression was completely at end.

By 1632 the Dutch had established a post on a peninsula named Tayoan , which was separated from the main part of Formosa by a shallow lagoon historically referred to as the Taikang inland sea . The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin , who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa , fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided him with a map of Taiwan.

In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">22-yard field goal</fact1> for the only score of the period.

The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark</fact2>. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe</fact3>. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett</fact4>. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation</fact5>. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After an exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu</fact6>. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints. How many yards longer was Jay Cutler's longest touchdown pass than Brett Favre's longest touchdown pass?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Jay Cutler's longest touchdown pass was 39 yards</fact6>, while <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;"><fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Brett Favre's longest touchdown pass was 6 yards</fact3></fact5>. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">39</fact6> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;"><fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">6</fact3></fact5> = 33.

Geng Jingzhong was executed; his brother Geng Juzhong 耿聚忠 was in Beijing with the Qing court with the Kangxi Emperor during the rebellion and was not punished for his brother's revolt.

Several Ming princes had accompanied <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662</fact1>, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan , son of Zhu Yihai. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. In 1685, the Qing used former Ming loyalist Han Chinese naval specialists who had served under the Zheng family in Taiwan in the siege of Albazin. Former Ming loyalist Han Chinese troops who had served under Zheng Chenggong and who specialized at fighting with rattan shields and swords  藤牌营 were recommended to the Kangxi Emperor to reinforce Albazin against the Russians. Kangxi was impressed by a demonstration of their techniques and ordered 500 of them to defend Albazin, under Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu, a former General of Wu Sangui.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>635/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Russia accused Georgia of committing "genocide" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the "thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians</fact1>.

As of May 2014, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20,272 persons remained displaced</fact3>, with their return being blocked by de facto authorities.

A year after the war, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced</fact2>, and by 2014, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20,272 persons remained displaced</fact3>. To find the number of Georgians who returned home, we need to subtract the number of displaced Georgians in 2014 from the number of displaced Georgians a year after the war. However, since the passage does not provide the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014, we can only use the total number of displaced persons in 2014 as a reference. Assuming that the 20,272 persons who remained displaced in 2014 were mostly Georgians, we can estimate the number of Georgians who returned home by subtracting 20,272 from 30,000. 30,000 - 20,272 = 9,728. However, this is not the number of Georgians who returned home out of the total number of displaced persons. To find that number, we need to subtract the number of displaced persons in 2014 from the total number of displaced persons and then subtract the number of Ossetians who were displaced.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>636/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60% of the median household income</fact1>. In 2007-2008, this was calculated to be £115 per week for single adults with no dependent children; £199 per week for couples with no dependent children; £195 per week for single adults with two dependent children under 14; and £279 per week for couples with two dependent children under 14. In 2007-2008, 13.5 million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU members. In the same year, 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line, after housing costs were taken into account. This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998-1999. How many percentage points out of 100 (what percent) of the median household income in the UK is the lowest that is considered to be above the poverty line?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, the poverty line is defined as being <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60% of the median household income</fact1>. To find the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line, we need to find the percentage that is just above 60%. Since the question asks for the percentage points out of 100, we can conclude that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is 61%. However, the passage does not explicitly state this. But we can infer that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is anything above <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60%</fact1>. So the answer is {61}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[60.0, 61.0]</div></div>

Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated. How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">wild grains were harvested 105,000 years ago</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago</fact2>.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>717/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The U.S. Marine Corps issued a request for proposals (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers</fact1>. By 2017, the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3,500 A2 series Humvees</fact2>, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">9,500 ECV Humvees</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5,000 JLTVs</fact4>, with <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000 vehicles in total</fact5>. Humvees in service with the Marine Corps will be upgraded through 2030. The Marines shelved the Humvee modernization effort in March 2015 due to budget cuts. How many of the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet by 2017 will not consist of the A2 series?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, the total number of vehicles in the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet by 2017 is <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000</fact5>, out of which <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3,500 are A2 series Humvees</fact2>. Therefore, the number of vehicles that are not A2 series is <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000</fact5> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3,500</fact2> = 14,500. Alternatively, the number of non-A2 series vehicles can also be calculated by adding the number of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">ECV Humvees (9,500)</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">JLTVs (5,000)</fact4>, which also equals 14,500.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>718/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Northern Europe is home to a large bear population, with an estimated <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2,500 (range 2,350-2,900) in Sweden</fact1>, about <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2,200 in Finland</fact2>, about 700 in Estonia and 70 in Norway, totaling to nearly 5,000 individuals in the wild. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500-3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of Austria until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss. The small group of bears living in the Carinthian-Slovenian Alps is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population. How many more large bears are there in Sweden compared to Finland?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">there are 2,500 bears in Sweden</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2,200 bears in Finland</fact2>. To find the difference, we subtract the number of bears in Finland from the number of bears in Sweden: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2,500</fact1> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2,200</fact2> = 300. So the answer is {300}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[300.0]</div></div>
