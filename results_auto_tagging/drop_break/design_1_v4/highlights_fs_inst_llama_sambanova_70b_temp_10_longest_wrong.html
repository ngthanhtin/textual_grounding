The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey. How many Korean immigrants were more men than woman and children?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">802 men</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">201 women and children</fact3> were among the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1,003 Korean immigrants</fact1>. To find the difference between the number of men and women and children, subtract the number of women and children from the number of men: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">802</fact2> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">201</fact3> = 601.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>81/ Reformatted Question:</strong> In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 May 1563</fact1>, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">13 August 1563</fact2>, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared. At sea a battle broke out near Öland on 11 September, whereafter the war took a pause.

The Irish delegates set up headquarters at Hans Place in Knightsbridge, and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken on 5 December to recommend the treaty to Dáil Éireann.The Second Dáil Éireann narrowly ratified the Treaty. In accordance with the treaty, on 6 December 1922 the entire island of Ireland became a self-governing Dominion called the Irish Free State . Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Parliament of Northern Ireland had the option to leave the Irish Free State one month later and return to the United Kingdom. During the intervening period, the powers of the Parliament of the Irish Free State and Executive Council of the Irish Free State did not extend to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland exercised its right under the treaty to leave the new Dominion and rejoined the United Kingdom on 8 December 1922. It did so by making an address to the King requesting, "that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland."

On their second offensive play from scrimmage, Flacco threw a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">74-yard touchdown pass</fact1> to rookie wide receiver Torrey Smith. It was the first catch of Smith's career and the longest pass of Flacco's career. Before the first quarter was up, Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">41</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">18 yards</fact3> respectively, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie.

This marked the first touchdown in Ngata's career. Offensively, the Ravens gained 553 yards in the entire game, a franchise record. The only score for the Rams came in the third quarter, when quarterback Sam Bradford threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Gibson.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Zadvarje</fact2>, and in July 1686 <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Dolac</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Srijane</fact4>, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>247/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1>, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917</fact2>. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3>.

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly "Redshanks" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 December 1688</fact1> the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under Richard Hamilton routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down  on <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">14 March 1689</fact2>.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>289/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in Silesia were based, in part, on a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1537 inheritance treaty</fact1> between the Silesian duke Frederick II of Legnica and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Silesian duchies of Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg were to pass to the Electorate of Brandenburg if the Silesian Piasts should become extinct. At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the "Great Elector" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1685</fact2>, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1694</fact3>, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage. How many years passed of the inheritance treaty being signed and the Emperor taking back control of Schwiebus?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">inheritance treaty was signed in 1537</fact1>, and the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1694</fact3>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1694</fact3> - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1537</fact1> = 157. However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of years between the signing of the treaty and the Emperor taking back control of Schwiebus, which is the difference between the year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus and the year the treaty was signed. However, the correct calculation should be the difference between the year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus and the year the Emperor gave control of Schwiebus to Elector Frederick William. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1694</fact3> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1685</fact2> = 9.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[157.0]</div></div>

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>313/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The Treaty of Karlowitz, signed in January 1699, confirmed the Venetian possession of Kephalonia, and the Morea with the island of Aigina, which became organized as the "Kingdom of the Morea" , divided into four provinces: Romania, with seat at Nafplion , Laconia, with seat at Monemvasia , Messenia, with seat at Navarino, and Achaea, with seat at Patras . The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">86,468 people</fact1> in the peninsula compared to a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">pre-war population of around 200,000</fact2>. Although the Venetians managed to restore some prosperity - the population allegedly rose to some 250,000 by 1708, probably driven by immigration - they failed to win the trust of their Greek Orthodox subjects, who were used to a relative autonomy under the Turks and resented the Venetian bureaucracy. The Venetians also launched a great fortification project throughout the Morea, whose results can still be seen today.

All the Spanish forces involved were conscripts; at this stage, Spain had neither professional troops, nor indigenous troops under arms. The Spanish army was poorly trained and equipped and lacked basic maps. The next day, the Spanish troops were shot at by francs-tireurs and skirmishes occurred near Melilla. General Marina decided to post six companies at Ait Aixa, under command of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Colonel Álvarez Cabrera</fact1>.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>337/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Following this victory, Edward realized that to create a force capable of retaking Jerusalem it would be necessary to end the internal unrest within the Christian state, and so he mediated between Hugh and his unenthusiastic knights from the Ibelin family of Cyprus.  In parallel to the mediation, Prince Edward and King Hugh began negotiating a truce with Sultan Baibars; a 10-year-10-month-and-10-day agreement was reached in May 1272, at Caesarea. Almost immediately Prince Edmund departed for England, while Edward remained to see if the treaty would hold. The following month, an attempt to assassinate Edward was made. Several versions of who sent the assassin exist. According to different versions, the assassin was sent by the emir of Ramlah or by Baibars. Some legends also say that the assassin was sent by the "Old Man of the Mountains", leader of a heretical Muslim sect. Edward killed the assassin but received a festering wound from a poisoned dagger in the process, further delaying Edward's own departure. In <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">September 1272</fact1>, Edward departed Acre for Sicily and, while recuperating on the island, he first received news of the death of his son John, and then a few months later news of the death of his father.  In 1273 Edward started his homeward journey via Italy, Gascony and Paris. Edward finally reached England in the middle of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1274</fact2>, and was crowned King of England on <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">19 August 1274</fact3>. How many months after departing for Sicily was Edward crowned King of England?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, Edward departed for Sicily in <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">September 1272</fact1>, and was crowned King of England on <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">19 August 1274</fact3>. To calculate the number of months, we need to calculate the difference between <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">August 1274</fact3> and <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">September 1272</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1274</fact2> - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1272</fact1> = 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equal to 24 months. However, since Edward departed in September and was crowned in August, we need to subtract 1 month from the total. 24 - 1 = 23 months, but also 1 month from the first year. So 23 - 1 = 22 months and then add the 11 months from the second year. So 22 + 11 = 23 + 11 - 12 = 22. So the answer is {22}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[23.0]</div></div>

The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country.

Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically.  Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much. Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1.  The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">293 comuneros</fact1>, a small figure given the huge number of rebels.  Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">293 excluded from the pardon</fact1>.

Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.

By 1632 the Dutch had established a post on a peninsula named Tayoan , which was separated from the main part of Formosa by a shallow lagoon historically referred to as the Taikang inland sea . The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin , who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa , fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided him with a map of Taiwan.

He was welcomed by the choir of the Serbian Orthodox Seminary with Turkish songs and vice-consul Milan Rakić had gathered a large contingent of Serbs, but many Albanians boycotted the event. Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels in Kosovo Vilayet and Scutari Vilayet separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottoman Empire first managed to pacify the northern Albanian malësorë  from Scutari Vilayet reaching a compromise during a meeting in Podgorica. In order to resolve the problems in the south, the Ottoman representatives invited Albanian southern leaders to a meeting in Tepelenë on 18 August 1911.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>692/ Reformatted Question:</strong> In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the "Lenin Levy", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to "proletarianize" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed "social-alien elements" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2.307 million members in 1939</fact1>, including candidate members, compared with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1.535 million in 1929</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6.3 million in 1947</fact3>.

The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Unions 15 republics.

In the first quarter, the Broncos jumped out to a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10-0 lead</fact1>, with a 4-yard touchdown run from running back Knowshon Moreno, followed by a 49-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Rams responded, with quarterback Sam Bradford throwing a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">36-yard touchdown pass</fact2> to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui. In the second quarter, The Broncos took a 13-7 lead, with a 40-yard field goal by Prater. However, the Rams would reel off 26 unanswered points, starting off with a pair of touchdown passes from Bradford to tight end Billy Bajema—2 and 26 yards—the latter with a missed extra point, followed by a pair of field goals from placekicker Josh Brown—28 and 37 yards—before halftime. In the third quarter, the Rams continued their offensive onslaught, with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Kenneth Darby, giving St. Louis a 33-13 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos snapped the Rams' streak of 26 unanswered points, with quarterback Kyle Orton throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, but the Rams responded with a 26-yard field goal from Brown. Trailing 36-20 with four minutes remaining, the Broncos tried to rally, with Orton throwing two touchdown passes—a 16-yarder to wide receiver Eddie Royal (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 5-yarder to Lloyd, but the Broncos' rally attempt was cut short by the Rams' defense. With the loss, the Broncos matched their loss total from the previous two seasons. How many scores behind were the Rams before their first points?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, the Broncos had a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10-0 lead</fact1> before the Rams scored their first points with a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">36-yard touchdown pass</fact2>. Since a touchdown is worth 7 points (including the extra point) and the Rams' first score was a touchdown, the Rams were 10 / 7 = 1.43 scores behind before their first points. However, since scores are typically measured in whole numbers, we can round down to 1 score, as the Rams were not yet behind by a full score.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[2.0]</div></div>
