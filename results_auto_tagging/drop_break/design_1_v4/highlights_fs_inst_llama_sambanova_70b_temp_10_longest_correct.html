The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>23/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A power outage that disrupted play in the third quarter served as a fitting metaphor for the Giants' general lack of power on the field this night. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice</fact1>, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard "pick 6" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>106/ Reformatted Question:</strong> On 26 October 1591, the Portuguese, led by André Furtado, mounted a military campaign against the Jaffna kingdom from Mannar.

Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night. The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram. Gago was killed in action and his entire company was wiped out. Advancing forces faced another ferocious defensive attack between the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and the Nallur Weerakaliyamman temple.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>124/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The first Azov campaign began in the spring of 1695. Peter the Great ordered his army  to advance towards Azov. The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh.In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.Between <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">June 27-July 5</fact1> the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">two unsuccessful attacks on August 5</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">September 25</fact3>, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army  under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople  the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone. How many days were there between the two unsuccessful attacks?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, the first unsuccessful attack occurred on <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">August 5</fact2> and the second on <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">September 25</fact3>. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference. August has 31 days, so from August 5 to August 31, there are 26 days. September has 25 days up to September 25. Therefore, the total number of days between August 5 and September 25 is 26 (remaining days in August) + 25 (days in September up to September 25) = 51.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today.

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of  of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment.

Ravens kicker Matt Stover booted a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44-yard field goal</fact1>, while quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Wilcox.  However, rookie  Quintin Demps returned the following kickoff 100 yards for a Philadelphia touchdown to make it 10-7 Ravens at halftime.  Andy Reid decided to bench McNabb (who was 8-for-18 for 59 yards and two interceptions) and put backup quarterback Kevin Kolb into the game.  Kolb also struggled with the Baltimore defense, and the Eagles fell behind 12-7 when linebacker Jameel McClain blocked Sav Rocca's punt into the back of the endzone for a safety. In the fourth, the Ravens kicked <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">another field goal</fact2> after a Kolb interception, then Mark Clayton took a short slant 53-yards for a touchdown to make it 22-7.  Kolb drove Philadelphia to the Raven 1-yard line, but was intercepted in the end zone by Ed Reed, who returned the ball an NFL-record 108 yards for the touchdown.  Le'Ron McClain added a 1-yard touchdown run as Baltimore won 36-7.  Kolb was 10-for-23 for 73 yards and two interceptions, and Brian Westbrook had 39 yards rushing on 14 carries.  The Eagles dropped to 5-5-1.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>204/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000</fact1>. In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000</fact2>. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10,000 people lived in Acalan in 1525</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4,000 people lived in Acalan in 1553</fact2>. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10,000</fact1> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4,000</fact2> = 6,000.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>239/ Reformatted Question:</strong> In 993, Khitans under General Xiao Sunning invaded Korea, but retreated after truce negotiations with minister Seo Hui of Goryeo, establishing friendly relations between the two nations. In <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1004, the Liao dynasty repulsed Song China</fact1>. Subsequently, as part of peace negotiations, Song China paid tribute to the Liao emperor. However, the tension between Goryeo and Liao created another war. In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1009, General Gang Jo of Goryeo led a coup against King Mokjong, killing the king and establishing military rule</fact2>. In <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1010, the alliance was broken and Liao attacked Korea for General Gang's treason</fact3>. Also, Khitans claimed six garrison settlements east of the Yalu River, which Goryeo claimed as its territory in truce negotiations during 993. After suffering numerous and heavy casualties against the Goryeo army, the Khitans managed to defeat Gangjo, who had begun to underestimate them. Despite this defeat, the Goryeo king managed to retain his claim on the six garrison settlements. The Khitans retreated from the peninsula, with no great prize for the war, but they did not give up their hope of gaining the six garrison settlements and making Goryeo pay tribute. However, beginning in the summer of 1018, the Khitans constructed a bridge across the Yalu River. How many times did the Liao dynasty have violent conflict between 1000 and 1010?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, the Liao dynasty had violent conflicts in <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1004</fact1> when they repulsed Song China and in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1010</fact3> when they attacked Korea. Although the passage mentions that General Gang Jo led a coup in <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1009</fact2>, this was an internal conflict within Goryeo and not directly a conflict between the Liao dynasty and another nation. Therefore, the answer is {2}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[2.0]</div></div>

The line, drawn about 5 km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition.

The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km  wide front moving 20-30 km  deeper into the Lithuanian territory.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>282/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Charles reached Rome in 1265, but was temporarily halted by financial embarrassments. Manfred, however, did not take the field against him until January 1266, when Charles' main army had crossed the Alps. Alarmed by desertions among his followers and fearing further treachery, Manfred sought to bring Charles to battle as swiftly as possible. Charles attempted to turn Manfred's position at Capua by a perilous crossing of the Apennines which wrecked his supply line; but Manfred had intelligence of his move and lay in a strong position across the River Calore, crossed only by one bridge. Charles had divided his cavalry into three "battles". The infantry and the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">first battle, consisting of 900 Provençals</fact1> were at the front, commanded by Marshal of France Hugh of Mirepoix and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Castres. Behind them were the second battle, which consisted of 400 Italians and 1,000 men of Languedoc and central France. Charles commanded the second battle in person. Behind them, the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">third battle consisted of about 700 men</fact2> from the county of Flanders under Constable of France Gilles II de Trasignies and Robert III of Flanders. Manfred had adopted similar dispositions. His Saracen archers were in the fore. Behind them was the first battle, 1,200 German mercenaries armed in coats of plates, commanded by his cousin Giordano d'Anglano and Galvano of Anglona. The second battle consisted of the Italian mercenaries, about 1,000, and 300 Saracen light horse, commanded by his uncle Galvano Lancia.

Alem and the death of Aristóbulo del Valle. In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist. The dissolution of the Radical Civic Union resulted in the formation of a core of radical elements that recognized as their leader Hipólito Yrigoyen. Onto this core - composed of young men, recruited from the middle class, professionals, businessmen, employees, ranchers of the old federal tradition, settlers and laborers from the countryside - was Yrigoyen able to impose discipline and enthusiasm. In this context, in 1903 Hipólito Yrigoyen began his revival and reorganization. On February 29 of 1904, after 7 years of inactivity, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union said the electoral abstention of all the radicals of the Republic in the elections of representatives from the nation, senators from the capital, electors for president and vice president of the nation, and announced an armed resistance.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>336/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Following this victory, Edward realized that to create a force capable of retaking Jerusalem it would be necessary to end the internal unrest within the Christian state, and so he mediated between Hugh and his unenthusiastic knights from the Ibelin family of Cyprus.  In parallel to the mediation, Prince Edward and King Hugh began negotiating a truce with Sultan Baibars; a 10-year-10-month-and-10-day agreement was reached in May 1272, at Caesarea. Almost immediately Prince Edmund departed for England, while Edward remained to see if the treaty would hold. The following month, an attempt to assassinate Edward was made. Several versions of who sent the assassin exist. According to different versions, the assassin was sent by the emir of Ramlah or by Baibars. Some legends also say that the assassin was sent by the "Old Man of the Mountains", leader of a heretical Muslim sect.

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma.

The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.

Since the question specifically asks about the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">first quarter</fact1>, the answer is 0 points.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[0.0, 7.0]</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>429/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Coming off their divisional home win over the Panthers, the Saints flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 10 duel with the St. Louis Rams. After a scoreless first quarter, New Orleans got the game's inaugural points in the second quarter with running back Reggie Bush getting a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3-yard touchdown run</fact1>. The Rams would respond with quarterback Marc Bulger completing a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donnie Avery. New Orleans would answer with quarterback Drew Brees hooking up with Bush on a 15-yard touchdown pass, yet St. Louis would close out the half with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Steven Jackson. The Saints would begin the third quarter with wide receiver Courtney Roby returning the second half's opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. The Rams would stay close with kicker Josh Brown nailing a 32-yard field goal. New Orleans would extend their lead in the fourth quarter Brees finding wide receiver Robert Meachem on a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">27-yard touchdown pass</fact2>. St. Louis tried to catch up as Bulger found Avery again on a 19-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion), yet the defense prevented the Rams from getting any closer. How many is the difference in the number of yards of Bush's TD run and the number of yards of the pass to Meachem?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bush's TD run was 3 yards</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the pass to Meachem was 27 yards</fact2>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">27</fact2> - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3</fact1> = 24.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>431/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">shortages of native labour and supplies</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick</fact2>, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many of the 150 men were not sick?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick</fact2>. To find the number of men who were not sick, we subtract the number of sick men from the total number of men. So, 150 - 25 = 125.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>445/ Reformatted Question:</strong> On <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 September 1580</fact1>, 600 Papal troops  commanded by Sebastiano di San Giuseppe , landed in Smerwick, near the same point where Fitzmaurice had landed the previous year. They had been paid for and sent by Pope Gregory to aid the rebellion. Desmond, Baltinglass and John of Desmond made an effort to link up with the expeditionary force but English forces under Ormonde and Grey blocked them and prompt naval action by Richard Bingham blockaded the Papal force's ships into the bay at Smerwick.

In <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">October 1580</fact2>, Grey de Wilton with up to 4000 troops arrived at Smerwick and laid siege to the garrison. The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow Dingle Peninsula, cut off by Mount Brandon on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir. After a three-day siege, commander Di san Giuseppe surrendered on <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 October 1580</fact3>. Grey de Wilton ordered the massacre of the invasion forces, sparing only the commanders. Italian and Spanish troops, and Irish men and women, were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea.

Four plays later, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell ran for a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">two-yard touchdown</fact1> to score the game's first touchdown, as the Redskins took the lead 7-0. After a holding penalty on Eagles tight end Brent Celek, the Eagles had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker David Akers. On the following drive by the Eagles, quarterback Donovan McNabb found wide receiver DeSean Jackson wide open in the end zone for a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">35-yard touchdown</fact2> to bring the Eagles up 10-7.

Late in the second quarter, after both teams punting the ball away after three unsuccessful drives, Eagles cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a Jason Campbell pass that was intended for Santana Moss. The Eagles could not convert a third down with 10 to go, and David Akers kicked a 24-yard field goal to get the Eagles within a point of the Redskins, 14-13.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.

The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>470/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Several 16th century writers estimated the 1492 population of Hispaniola at over 1 million people. 20th century estimates of the figure range from 60,000 to 8,000,000, but center around the 500,000 to 1,000,000 range. Harsh enslavement by Spanish colonists, as well as redirection of food supplies and labor towards the colonists, had a devastating impact on both mortality and fertility over the first quarter century. Colonial administrators and Dominican and Hyeronimite priests observed that the search for gold and agrarian enslavement through the encomienda system were depressing population. Demographic data from two provinces in 1514 shows a low birth rate consistent with a 3.5% annual population decline. Just 14,000 Taínos survived in 1517.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>611/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Hoping to rebound from their fourth-quarter collapse to the Panthers, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field to face Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">22-yard field goal</fact1> for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>635/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Russia accused Georgia of committing "genocide" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the "thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights.

To find the number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes by 2014, we need to subtract the number of displaced persons in 2014 from the number of displaced Georgians a year after the war. However, the passage does not provide the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014, but rather the total number of displaced persons. Assuming that the 20,272 persons remaining displaced in 2014 include both Ossetians and Georgians, we cannot determine the exact number of Georgians who returned home.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3-0 lead</fact1>. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their "Wildcat" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">7-3 lead</fact2>.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>685/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunter-gatherer. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago</fact1>. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC.

Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago</fact2>, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the "Lenin Levy", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to "proletarianize" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3.5 million members</fact1>. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed "social-alien elements" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1.9 million by 1939</fact2>. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members—approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>717/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The U.S. Marine Corps issued a request for proposals (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet</fact1>, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers. By 2017, the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3,500 A2 series Humvees</fact2>, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">9,500 ECV Humvees</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5,000 JLTVs</fact4>, with <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000 vehicles in total</fact5>. Humvees in service with the Marine Corps will be upgraded through 2030. The Marines shelved the Humvee modernization effort in March 2015 due to budget cuts.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>718/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Northern Europe is home to a large bear population, with an estimated <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2,500 (range 2,350-2,900)</fact1> in Sweden, about <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2,200</fact2> in Finland, about 700 in Estonia and 70 in Norway, totaling to nearly 5,000 individuals in the wild. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500-3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of Austria until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss. The small group of bears living in the Carinthian-Slovenian Alps is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population.
