Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss.

How many more rushing touchdowns were there relative to passing touchdowns?


**Answer:**  The question asks for the difference between rushing and passing touchdowns.  The passage mentions the following:

* <fact1>One 2-yard touchdown pass</fact1> by Matt Ryan.
* <fact4>One 3-yard touchdown pass</fact4> by Jason Campbell.
* <fact2>One 30-yard touchdown run</fact2> by Michael Turner.
* <fact3>One 1-yard touchdown run</fact3> by Ladell Betts.
* <fact5>One 58-yard touchdown run</fact5> by Michael Turner.

This means there were <fact1>1</fact1> + <fact4>1</fact4> = 2 passing touchdowns, and <fact2>1</fact2> + <fact3>1</fact3> + <fact5>1</fact5> = 3 rushing touchdowns.

Therefore, there were 3 - 2 = 1 more rushing touchdown than passing touchdowns.  So the answer is {1}.

* <fact1>White: 97.90%</fact1>
* <fact2>African American: 0.56%</fact2>
* <fact3>Native American: 0.15%</fact3>
* <fact4>Asian: 0.28%</fact4>
* <fact5>Pacific Islander: 0.02%</fact5>
* <fact6>Other Race: 0.36%</fact6>
* <fact7>Two or more races: 0.74%</fact7>
* <fact8>Hispanic/Latino: 0.93%</fact8>

The question is asking for everyone *except* those solely identified as White or solely identified as African American.  We can find this by adding all the other percentages or by subtracting the White and African American percentages from 100%.

Adding all the other percentages:  0.15 + 0.28 + 0.02 + 0.36 + 0.74 + 0.93 = 2.48%

Subtracting White and African American from 100%: 100 - 97.90 - 0.56 = 1.54%


Note: The provided percentages don't sum to 100%, which might be intentional to reflect some level of overlapping identifications (like being both White and Hispanic). The prompt doesn't explicitly say whether Hispanic/Latino is a racial classification in the context of this particular census data, so there is potential ambiguity around the <fact8>0.93% Hispanic/Latino</fact8> statistic.

Since the question asks for people not solely identified as White or African American, the most accurate method, given this ambiguity and the fact that the categories don't neatly sum to 100%, is to sum the explicitly non-White, non-African American percentages, ignoring the potentially overlapping Hispanic/Latino statistic. Therefore:

0.15 + 0.28 + 0.02 + 0.36 + 0.74  = 1.55%

Final Answer: {1.55}

At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army.

At the 1521 Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther banned and the proliferation of his writings prohibited, which in 1529 provoked the Protestation at Speyer by several Lutheran estates.  The tensions culminated to an open conflict over the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, the Apology of which, written by Philipp Melanchthon, was rejected by the Emperor.

The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway <fact1>near Lima in 2007</fact1>. Forensic evidence suggests that <fact2>the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536</fact2>. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.:235-237 How many years after <fact2>the uprising in 1536</fact2> where many natives were killed did Archaeologists find their remains <fact1>near Lima</fact1>?



Answer: The passage states that the native remains were found <fact1>in 2007</fact1>, and that they were likely killed during <fact2>the uprising in 1536</fact2>. 2007 - 1536 = 471. So the answer is {471}.

Answer:
The question asks for the percentage of households that are *not* same-sex partnerships.  We are told that <fact1>0.7% of households are same-sex partnerships</fact1>.  Therefore, the remaining percentage must be households that are not same-sex partnerships.  100% - <fact1>0.7%</fact1> = 99.3%.  So the answer is {99.3}.

The passage states that <fact2>French casualties exceeded 1,000 killed, 3,700 wounded, and 1,000 missing</fact2>.  1,000 + 3,700 + 1,000 = 5,700. So the answer is {5,700}.  Note that the 8,628 number refers to deaths (from battle and disease), not total casualties.

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia. It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed.

history_1459_c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6,"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche.

Answer: The question asks for the difference in length between the longest and shortest *offensive* touchdown runs.  

* <fact1>Julius Jones had a 27-yard TD run</fact1>.
* <fact2>Bryant Johnson had a 3-yard TD reception</fact2> (this is not a run, so we disregard it).
* <fact3>Frank Gore had a 2-yard TD run</fact3>.
* <fact4>T.J. Duckett had a 1-yard TD run</fact4>.

The longest offensive touchdown run was <fact1>27 yards (Julius Jones)</fact1> and the shortest was <fact4>1 yard (T.J. Duckett)</fact4>.  Therefore, the difference is 27 - 1 = 26 yards.  So the answer is {26}.

* <fact2>African American: 1.03%</fact2>

The total percentage of White and Asian people is <fact1>82.39%</fact1> + <fact4>4.52%</fact4> = 86.91%.

Since the total population represents 100%, the percentage of people who are not White or Asian is 100% - 86.91% = 13.09%.

So the answer is {13.09}.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.

How many more <fact2>females</fact2> per 100 age <fact3>18 and over</fact3> were there than <fact4>males</fact4>?

Answer: The question asks how many *more* <fact2>females</fact2> there are than <fact4>males</fact4> per 100 <fact2>females</fact2> <fact3>18 and over</fact3>. The passage states that for every 100 <fact2>females</fact2> <fact3>age 18 and over</fact3>, there are 173.2 <fact4>males</fact4>.  Since the question asks how many *more* <fact2>females</fact2> there are than <fact4>males</fact4> *per 100 females*, and there are more <fact4>males</fact4> than <fact2>females</fact2> in this scenario, the answer must be negative. Thus there are 100 - 173.2 = -73.2 *more* <fact2>females</fact2> <fact3>over the age of 18</fact3> per 100 <fact2>females</fact2>.  Therefore, the answer is {73.2}.

Answer: The passage states that <fact2>the Siege of Derry began</fact2> on <fact1>December 7, 1688</fact1>.  The encounter at Dromore, County Down took place on <fact3>March 14, 1689</fact3>.

More precisely, from December 7, 1688 to March 7, 1689 is three months.  From March 7 to March 14 is another 7 days.

The line, drawn about 5 km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition. Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35 km . The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km  wide front moving 20-30 km  deeper into the Lithuanian territory. On July 18, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. <fact1>It was approved by the Entente on July 26</fact1>. <fact2>The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3</fact2>. Two major modifications favorable to the Poles were made: the Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km  west. Again, both Poles and Lithuanians protested the line as it would require them to withdraw their armies from the Vilnius and Suwałki Regions respectively. German administration, which had not yet retreated from the Suwałki Region, also opposed the Foch Line. The new line did not immediately halt the hostilities. After a couple of Polish attacks on July 29 and August 2, the front stabilized. How many days did it take after approval of the Foch Line for the Lithuanians to be informed about it?

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>the Foch Line was approved on July 26</fact1> and <fact2>the Lithuanians were informed about it on August 3</fact2>.  From July 26th to August 3rd is 8 days (31-26 = 5 days remaining in July, plus 3 days in August). Therefore, the answer is {8}.

All the Spanish forces involved were conscripts; at this stage, Spain had neither professional troops, nor indigenous troops under arms. The Spanish army was poorly trained and equipped and lacked basic maps. The next day, the Spanish troops were shot at by francs-tireurs and skirmishes occurred near Melilla. General Marina decided to post six companies at Ait Aixa, under command of Colonel Álvarez Cabrera. They left Melilla at nightfall but got lost and, in the morning, found themselves in the Alfer Canyon, where they were decimated by gunfire from the heights. Colonel Cabrera and 26 men were killed, and 230 were wounded. On 26 June, the Spanish suffered a second defeat at the Lobo Canyon, when Marina sent another force under General Pintos to protect Segunda Caseta.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side.

**Answer:**  The question asks for the *difference* in casualties.

* **Sendling's Night of Murder:**  <fact5>Bavarians lost approximately 1,100 men</fact5>, while <fact6>Austrians lost about 40</fact6>.  The difference here is 1,100 - 40 = 1,060.

* **Battle of Aidenbach:** <fact8>Bavarians suffered about 4,000 casualties</fact8>. The passage doesn't mention Austrian casualties in this battle.  Therefore we can only account for the Bavarian losses.

* **Total Difference:**  Adding the differences together, we get 1,060 (from Sendling) + 4,000 (from Aidenbach) = 5,060.

So, based on the provided information, the difference in casualties mentioned is {5,060} in favor of the Austrians (meaning the Bavarians suffered 5,060 more casualties than the Austrians in the described battles).

Answer: Edward left Acre for Sicily in <fact1>September 1272</fact1> and started his journey home from Sicily in <fact4>1273</fact4>.  Since he departed Sicily in 1273, he spent a portion of 1272 and 1273 in Sicily, less than a full year each.

Answer: According to the passage, the <fact2>average household size was 2.20</fact2> and the <fact3>average family size was 2.90</fact3>.  Since the question asks how many *more* was the average household size than the family size, and 2.20 is smaller than 2.90, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 2.90 - 2.20 = 0.70. Therefore the average family size was larger by {-0.70} than average household size.

The passage lists the following countries: <fact3>Turkey</fact3>, <fact4>Iran</fact4>, <fact5>Syria</fact5>, <fact6>Lebanon</fact6>, <fact7>Jordan</fact7>, <fact9>Egypt</fact9>, and <fact10>Israel</fact10>.  The Balkans (<fact2>) is a region, not a single country. While the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Dynasty existed, those empires are replaced by modern nations mentioned above (Turkey, Iran).  Kosovo's (<fact8>) status as independent is disputed.  New York and New Jersey are in the United States and thus represent a single country. Therefore, there are 7 countries listed as destinations for Circassian refugees: Turkey, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel plus one (United States). Thus, based on the named countries listed, the answer is {8}.

history_1298_989273e3-6d57-46d1-bbac-08932bce8dd2,"Some sources state that three million Circassians were evicted from Circassia in a period lasting until 1911. Other sources cite upwards of two million Circassian refugees fleeing Circassia by 1914 and entering nations and regions such as the Balkans, Turkey, what was the Ottoman Empire in what was known as the Muhajir, Iran, the Qajar dynasty also as Muhajir, Syria, Lebanon, what is now Jordan, Kosovo, Egypt , Israel  and as far afield as upstate New York and New Jersey. Some 90 percent of people with Circassian descent now live in other countries, primarily in Turkey, Jordan and other countries of the Middle East, with only 300,000-400,000 remaining in what is now Russia. The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by numerous ethnic groups, including Russians, Ukrainians and Georgians. Friction developed between the latter group and the remaining indigenous people in Abkhazia, a factor later contributing to friction between the two ethnic groups and the resulting War in Abkhazia. How many countries resettled on Circassian lands?","Reformatted Question: Some sources state that three million Circassians were evicted from Circassia in a period lasting until 1911.

How many countries resettled on Circassian lands?

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>Russians, Ukrainians, and Georgians resettled on Circassian lands</fact1>.  These are ethnic groups, not countries.  The question asks how many *countries* resettled the land. The passage says numerous ethnic groups resettled the land but only lists those three ethnic groups.  The passage does *not* state which countries those groups originated from nor does it say other countries' peoples moved onto the land.  Therefore, we cannot definitively answer how many *countries* resettled on the land from the information given.

In what was another close game resulting in a tough loss, the Texans went into their bye week at 5-4. How many more yards of fieldgoals did Stover score compared to Brown?

Answer: Stover kicked a <fact1>22-yard</fact1> and a <fact1>37-yard</fact1> field goal.  <fact1>22</fact1> + <fact1>37</fact1> = 59. Brown kicked a <fact2>56-yard</fact2> and a <fact2>42-yard</fact2> field goal. <fact2>56</fact2> + <fact2>42</fact2> = 98.  Since the question asks how many *more* yards Stover scored, and Stover actually scored *fewer* yards, the question should be interpreted as how many fewer yards of field goals did Stover score compared to Brown. 98 - 59 = 39.  So the answer is {39}.

history_1352_e4d11a90-2b7e-47c0-a1c8-901c885ff5ea,"On 10 September 1580, 600 Papal troops  commanded by Sebastiano di San Giuseppe , landed in Smerwick, near the same point where Fitzmaurice had landed the previous year. They had been paid for and sent by Pope Gregory to aid the rebellion. Desmond, Baltinglass and John of Desmond made an effort to link up with the expeditionary force but English forces under Ormonde and Grey blocked them and prompt naval action by Richard Bingham blockaded the Papal force's ships into the bay at Smerwick. San Giuseppe had no choice but to fortify his men in the fort at Dún an Óir. In October 1580, Grey de Wilton with up to 4000 troops arrived at Smerwick and laid siege to the garrison. The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow Dingle Peninsula, cut off by Mount Brandon on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir. After a three-day siege, commander Di san Giuseppe surrendered on 10 October 1580. Grey de Wilton ordered the massacre of the invasion forces, sparing only the commanders. Italian and Spanish troops, and Irish men and women, were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.

**Answer:** The question asks for the percentage of married couples *not* living together.  The provided information states that <fact2>46.28% of households were married couples living together</fact2>.  This information is about couples living *together*, not those living apart, so it isn't directly helpful.  The question does not provide any information about married couples who are not living together.  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information.  It's important to note that some of the other provided facts (<fact1>percentage with children</fact1>, <fact3>female householder with no husband</fact3>, <fact4>non-families</fact4>, <fact5>individuals</fact5>, and <fact6>living alone over 65</fact6>) relate to different household compositions, but none of them directly address the percentage of married couples living apart.

The fates of the rest are unknown. How many of the <fact1>293</fact1> prisoners were not pardoned, purchased amnesty or were executed?

Answer: The passage states that out of the <fact1>293 comuneros</fact1> excluded from the initial pardon, <fact2>23 were executed</fact2>, <fact3>20 died in prison</fact3>, <fact4>50 purchased amnesty</fact4>, and <fact5>100 were pardoned later</fact5>.  This accounts for <fact2>23</fact2> + <fact3>20</fact3> + <fact4>50</fact4> + <fact5>100</fact5> = 193 comuneros.  Since there were <fact1>293</fact1> total, the number whose fates are unknown is <fact1>293</fact1> - 193 = 100.  So the answer is {100}.

**Answer:** The passage states that <fact1>approximately 85% of palm plantations and extraction mills are in southern Thailand</fact1>.  This implies the remaining percentage are located in other parts of the country. While the passage doesn't explicitly state the percentage in northern Thailand, it *does* tell us where the vast majority are located. Since the question asks *about* how many are in northern Thailand, and we know a very large percentage are in the south, it's reasonable to infer that a relatively small percentage are in the north.  Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be a small percentage like {less than 15%} or {approximately 15%}.

The population density was 88 people per square mile (34/km2).  There were 21,779 housing units at an average density of 39 per square mile (15/km2).

How many percent of the population did not report speaking Spanish language at home?

Answer: The question asks for the percentage of the population that did *not* report speaking Spanish at home.  Since <fact1>2.85% reported speaking Spanish</fact1>, the remaining percentage must not speak Spanish. This is calculated by subtracting the Spanish-speaking percentage from the total (100%): 100% - <fact1>2.85%</fact1> = 97.15%. So the answer is {97.15}.

The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower.

The median age was 40.9 years. How many people, in terms of percentage of the population, were between the ages of 5 and 29, inclusive?

Answer: To find the percentage of the population between the ages of 5 and 29, we need to add the percentages for each age range within that span.

* <fact1>5-9 years: 6.3%</fact1>
* <fact2>10-14 years: 6.7%</fact2>
* <fact3>15-19 years: 6.5%</fact3>
* <fact4>20-24 years: 5.5%</fact4>
* <fact5>25-29 years: 5.5%</fact5>

Total: <fact1>6.3</fact1> + <fact2>6.7</fact2> + <fact3>6.5</fact3> + <fact4>5.5</fact4> + <fact5>5.5</fact5> = 30.5%

**Answer:** The passage states that <fact1>several Ming princes accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662</fact1>. This implies they were there for a period spanning parts of both 1661 and 1662. Therefore, they were in Taiwan for approximately one to two years, since 1662 - 1661 = 1 year, and it's possible there was part of a year included on either side.

Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television.

By 2014, how many Georgians were actually able to return to their homes?


**Answer:**  The passage states that <fact1>192,000 people were initially displaced</fact1>.  Later, <fact3>30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced one year after the war</fact3>. This means that at least 192,000 - 30,000 = 162,000 people returned within a year. By <fact4>May 2014, the number of displaced persons, including Georgians, decreased further to 20,272</fact4>.  The question focuses on the return of Georgians.  Since the 30,000 figure referred specifically to ethnic Georgians, and the 20,272 figure likely includes other groups as well, we can infer that at least 30,000 - 20,272 = 9,728 more Georgians returned to their homes between one year after the war and May 2014. This brings the minimum number of returned Georgians to 162,000 + 9,728 = 171,728. While the exact number of returning Georgians is not explicitly given, the information provided allows us to determine that *at least* {171,728} Georgians returned to their homes by 2014.

* **German Population:** <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> * <fact2>0.337 (33.7%)</fact2> = 2624.67 people
* **Irish Population:** <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> * <fact4>0.101 (10.1%)</fact4> = 786.89 people
* **Danish Population:** <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> * <fact5>0.054 (5.4%)</fact5> = 420.71 people
* **Combined Irish and Danish:** 786.89 + 420.71 = 1207.6 people
* **Difference:** 2624.67 - 1207.6 = 1417.07 people

Since we are dealing with people, we should round to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, there were approximately {1417} more people of German ancestry than Irish and Danish combined.

**Answer:**  The question asks for the total Buick production from 1904-1908.  According to the passage:
* <fact2>37 cars were made in 1904</fact2>.
* <fact3>750 cars were made in 1905</fact3>.
* <fact4>1,400 cars were made in 1906</fact4>.
* <fact5>4,641 cars were made in 1907</fact5>.
* <fact6>8,800 cars were made in 1908</fact6>.

Adding those figures together: 37 + 750 + 1,400 + 4,641 + 8,800 = 15,628.

So the answer is {15628}.

How many areas used napalm in only one year?
Answer: The question asks how many areas used napalm in only one year.  Looking at the years provided:

* <fact4>Israel in 1967</fact4>
* <fact5>Nigeria in 1969</fact5>
* <fact7>Egypt in 1973</fact7>
* <fact9>Argentina in 1982</fact9>

India and Pakistan used napalm in two separate years listed (<fact6>1965 and 1971</fact6>), so they are not counted. Iraq also used it in multiple years (<fact11>1980-1988 and 1991</fact11>).

Therefore, only four areas used napalm in a single listed year.  So the answer is {4}.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter.

The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots career. How many points ahead were the Dolphins after Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer?","Reformatted Question: Looking to avoid back-to-back divisional losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half.

Answer: The question provides the number of people and the percentage of the population for each age group. We can use any of these age groups to calculate the total population.  Let's use the first one: <fact1>11,818 children constitute 9.4% of the population</fact1>.

To find the total population, we can set up a proportion:

9.4% / 11,818 = 100% / x

Solving for x:

x = (11,818 * 100) / 9.4 
x = 125,723.4

Since population must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

So the answer is {125723}.

Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated. How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>wild grains were collected from 105,000 years ago</fact1>.  <fact2>The potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago</fact2>, so at its earliest, this would be 10,000 years ago. 105,000 - 10,000 = 95,000.  So the answer is {95,000}.

**Answer:** The passage states that the Broncos ""<fact1>jumped out to a 10-0 lead</fact1>"" before the Rams ""<fact4>responded</fact4>"" with their first score.  This means the Rams were 10 points behind before they scored.  Since touchdowns are worth 6 points and the Broncos scored one touchdown (<fact2>4-yard touchdown run</fact2>) and one field goal (<fact3>49-yard field goal</fact3>), we know field goals are worth 3 points (6 + 3 = 9 + 1 for the extra point after the TD = 10 total points).  Therefore, the Rams were 10 points, or two scores (one touchdown and one field goal),  behind before their first score. While the questions asks how many *scores* behind they were, and since ""score"" can be interpreted as points, the answer is {10}.

The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018.
