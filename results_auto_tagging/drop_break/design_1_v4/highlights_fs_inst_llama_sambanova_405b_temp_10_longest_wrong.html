How many people, in terms of percentage, were not solely White or solely African American?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">97.9% were White</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">0.56% were African American</fact2>. The percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">100% - (97.9% + 0.56%) = 1.54%</fact3>. However, this 1.54% includes <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">0.74% from two or more races</fact7> which may include White and/or African American. To find the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American, we need to subtract the percentage of people who were two or more races from the total percentage of people who were not White or African American: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1.54%</fact3> - <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">0.74%</fact7> is not correct since 0.74% is part of the 1.54%. Instead, we should consider that 0.74% from two or more races may include White and/or African American, and the remaining percentage is from other races: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">0.15% Native American</fact3>, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">0.28% Asian</fact4>, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">0.02% Pacific Islander</fact5>, and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">0.36% from other races</fact6>. The sum of these percentages is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">0.15%</fact3> + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">0.28%</fact4> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">0.02%</fact5> + <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">0.36%</fact6> = 0.81%. Adding the percentage of people who were two or more races (which may include White and/or African American) to this sum, we get: 0.81% + <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">0.74%</fact7> = 1.55%.

From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">touchdown</fact1>.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">26-yard field goal</fact2>.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">11-yard TD</fact3> on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">37-yarder</fact4> and a <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">51-yarder</fact5>) and one field goal in the third (a <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20-yarder</fact6>).

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Zadvarje</fact2>, and in July 1686 <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Dolac and Srijane</fact3>, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686</fact1>. On 1 September 1687 the siege of <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Herceg Novi</fact4> started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688</fact5>. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Sinj</fact1> again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled.

His objective was to occupy and reinforce the strongholds of Mérida and Medellín, controlled by Beatriz Pacheco, Countess of Medellin and supporter of Afonso V. According to Palencia, the Portuguese army was composed of about <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1,000 Knights</fact1>, plus infantry. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">180 Knights of the Order of Santiago</fact2> marched alongside him, commanded by their treasurer, Alfonso de Monroy. On February 24, near the hill of Albuera, the army was challenged by Isabellian forces commanded by Alonso de Cárdenas, Master of the Order of Santiago.

French casualties exceeded 1,000 killed, 3,700 wounded and 1,000 missing - representing losses of over 20 percent of their forces deployed in the Rif. The French accordingly intervened on the side of Spain, employing up to 160,000 well trained and equipped troops from Metropolitan, Algerian, Senegalese and Foreign Legion units, as well as Moroccan regulars  and auxiliaries . With total Spanish forces now numbering about 90,000 the Rifian forces were now seriously outnumbered by their Franco-Spanish opponents. Final French deaths from battle and disease, in what had now become a major war, were to total 8,628. How many French out-posts were still there?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>According to the passage, there were originally <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">66 French posts</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned</fact2>. To find the number of posts still there, we need to subtract the number of posts stormed or abandoned from the total number of posts.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>247/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1>, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">February Revolution of 1917</fact2>. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3>. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>291/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in Silesia were based, in part, on a 1537 inheritance treaty between the Silesian duke Frederick II of Legnica and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Silesian duchies of Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg were to pass to the Electorate of Brandenburg if the Silesian Piasts should become extinct. At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the "Great Elector" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bohemian Revolt</fact1> and the outbreak of the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Thirty Years' War</fact2>, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Battle of White Mountain</fact3>. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Great Turkish War</fact4>, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>465/ Reformatted Question:</strong> From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Monte Cassino</fact1> and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Myitkyina</fact2>. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>493/ Reformatted Question:</strong> In 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15-1-0, setting the record for most regular season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and finally broken by the 2007 New England Patriots (with 16 regular season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (they won 18 straight, but lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants). The 49ers only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20-17 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good.

Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically.  Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much. Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1.  The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">293 comuneros</fact1>, a small figure given the huge number of rebels.  Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">293 excluded from the pardon</fact1>.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>691/ Reformatted Question:</strong> In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the "Lenin Levy", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to "proletarianize" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3.5 million members</fact1>. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed "social-alien elements" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1.9 million by 1939</fact2>. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members—approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>694/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Serbia and Montenegro was a confederated union which existed between 2003 and 2006. The two republics initially formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992. The economics of Serbia and Montenegro entered a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">prolonged decline in 1989</fact1>. Exacerbated by the economic embargo imposed during the Bosnian war, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) economy's downward spiral showed no real sign of recovery until 1995. Gross domestic product was nowhere near its 1991 level, but the Kosovo War of the basic infrastructure of the country and many factories, as well as a renewed embargo caused a further huge drop in GDP in relation to the 1991 level. The <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">first sign of an economic recovery occurred in 2001</fact2> after the removal of Milošević on 5 October 2000.  A vigorous team of economic reformers has worked to tame inflation (non-energy inflation is less than 9% in 2002, down from over 120% two years earlier) and rationalize the Serbia and Montenegro economy. Gross domestic product, although only half of its 1997 level, is projected to increase steadily in the near future. As of January 2005 GDP has recovered to 55-60% of its 1990 level, due to GDP growth of 8.5% in 2004.
