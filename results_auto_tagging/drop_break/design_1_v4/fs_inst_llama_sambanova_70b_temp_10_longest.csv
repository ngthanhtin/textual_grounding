Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss. But the Giants' turnover problem resurfaced in the fourth quarter, where a fumble and an interception ended up costing them any chance at a comeback.

How many more Macedonians were there compared to Albanians according to the 2002 census?

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>there were 338,358 Macedonians</fact1> and <fact2>103,891 Albanians</fact2> in Skopje. To find the difference, subtract the number of Albanians from the number of Macedonians: <fact1>338,358</fact1> - <fact2>103,891</fact2> = 234,467. So the answer is {234,467}."

How many in percent from the census in Skopje weren't Roma?

Answer: To find the percentage of people who weren't Roma, we need to add the percentage of Roma people to 100%. According to the passage, <fact1>Roma people made up 4.63% of the population</fact1>. However, to find the percentage of people who weren't Roma, we need to know the total population, which isn't given directly. We can, however, add up the given percentages and the number of people who didn't belong to any group to find the total population and then calculate the percentage of people who weren't Roma. Since the question doesn't provide enough information to calculate the exact percentage, we can calculate the percentage of people who weren't Roma by subtracting the percentage of Roma people from 100%. The percentage of people who weren't Roma is 100% - 4.63% = 95.37%."

From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a <fact1>punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown</fact1>.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a <fact2>26-yard field goal</fact2>.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an <fact3>11-yard TD on a reverse</fact3>.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a <fact4>37-yarder</fact4> and a <fact5>51-yarder</fact5>) and one field goal in the third (a <fact6>20-yarder</fact6>).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.  QB Michael Vick got sacked five times, while he and RB Warrick Dunn would only combine for 101 rushing yards.

Answer: According to the passage, the Saints scored a touchdown (6 points) from a blocked punt (<fact1>punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown</fact1>), an 11-yard TD on a reverse (<fact3>11-yard TD on a reverse</fact3>), and 4 field goals (3, 7, 8, and 3 points respectively from <fact2>26-yard field goal</fact2>, <fact4>37-yarder</fact4>, <fact5>51-yarder</fact5>, and <fact6>20-yarder</fact6>). However, the Falcons only scored 3 points from a field goal. Therefore, the Falcons fell behind by 6 + 7 + 8 + 3 - 3 = 21 points."

Answer: According to the passage, Morten Andersen kicked a 26-yard field goal, but the passage does not specify that this was in the first quarter. However, the passage does state that the Falcons responded to the Saints' initial touchdown with Andersen's field goal, and the Saints' subsequent points were scored in the second and third quarters. Therefore, it can be inferred that Andersen's field goal was in the first quarter. So the answer is {1}."

At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September.

He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders.

The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007.

Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors.

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>81.7%</fact1> spoke only English at home, <fact2>9.6%</fact2> spoke Spanish, and <fact3>1.2%</fact3> spoke Vietnamese. To find the percentage of people who did not speak Vietnamese, we need to add the percentages of those who spoke English and Spanish, and then add the remaining percentage of the population. <fact1>81.7%</fact1> + <fact2>9.6%</fact2> + <fact3>1.2%</fact3> = 92.5%. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, the remaining percentage is 100% - 92.5% = 7.5%. However, this 7.5% includes people who spoke other languages, not just those who did not speak Vietnamese. Since we are only interested in those who did not speak Vietnamese, we can simply subtract the percentage of Vietnamese speakers from 100%. 100% - <fact3>1.2%</fact3> = 98.8%.

Answer: According to the passage, the first unsuccessful attack occurred on <fact2>August 5</fact2> and the second on <fact3>September 25</fact3>. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference. August has 31 days, so from August 5 to August 31, there are 26 days. September has 25 days up to September 25. Therefore, the total number of days between August 5 and September 25 is 26 (remaining days in August) + 25 (days in September up to September 25) = 51. So the answer is {51}."

Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6-5. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke (baseball), hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7-6. Oddly enough, a fan in the ""Crawford Boxes"" in left field had previously caught Berkmans grand slam and this same fan caught Burkes home run.  The 2005 National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 National League Championship Series. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games, with Roy Oswalt getting the win.

Answer: According to the passage, there were a total of <fact2>3 interceptions</fact2> by Manning, and one of them was to <fact1>Terrell Thomas</fact1> and another to <fact3>Antrel Rolle</fact3>. However, the passage does not explicitly state that both Thomas and Rolle are from Arizona, it only mentions that the game was between Giants and Cardinals, and that Terrell Thomas is a Giants player, and Antrel Rolle is a Cardinals player. Therefore, the answer is {1} (the one to Antrel Rolle) plus possibly another 2 if Terrell Thomas is also an Arizona player, but that is not the case."

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors.

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of  of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included <fact1>over 361 scholars</fact1>, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong as chief editors. There was <fact2>around 3,826 scribes</fact2> who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia.

Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I.

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly ""Redshanks"" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under Richard Hamilton routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down  on 14 March 1689 and occupied eastern Ulster.

After a couple of Polish attacks on July 29 and August 2, the front stabilized. How many days after Foch's proposal was it approved by the Entente?","Reformatted Question: The Conference of Ambassadors drew the first demarcation line on June 18. The line, drawn about 5 km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition. Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35 km . The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km  wide front moving 20-30 km  deeper into the Lithuanian territory. On <fact1>July 18</fact1>, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. It was approved by the Entente on <fact2>July 26</fact2>. The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3. Two major modifications favorable to the Poles were made: the Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km  west. Again, both Poles and Lithuanians protested the line as it would require them to withdraw their armies from the Vilnius and Suwałki Regions respectively. German administration, which had not yet retreated from the Suwałki Region, also opposed the Foch Line. The new line did not immediately halt the hostilities. After a couple of Polish attacks on July 29 and August 2, the front stabilized. How many days after Foch's proposal was it approved by the Entente?

Answer: According to the passage, Foch proposed the second demarcation line on <fact1>July 18</fact1> and it was approved by the Entente on <fact2>July 26</fact2>. <fact2>July 26</fact2> - <fact1>July 18</fact1> = 8 days. So the answer is {8}."

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.

Answer: According to the passage, the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre occurred on <fact1>25 December 1705</fact1> and the Battle of Aidenbach occurred on <fact2>8 January 1706</fact2>. To find the number of days between these dates, we need to calculate the number of days in December after the 25th and add the number of days in January until the 8th. December has 31 days, so there are 6 days remaining in December after the 25th (31 - 25 = 6). January 8th is the 8th day of the month. Therefore, the total number of days between the two dates is 6 (remaining days in December) + 8 (days in January) = 14. So the answer is {14}."

Answer: According to the passage, Edward departed for Sicily in <fact1>September 1272</fact1>, and was crowned King of England on <fact3>19 August 1274</fact3>. To calculate the number of months, we need to calculate the difference between <fact3>August 1274</fact3> and <fact1>September 1272</fact1>. <fact2>1274</fact2> - <fact1>1272</fact1> = 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equal to 24 months. However, since Edward departed in September and was crowned in August, we need to subtract 1 month from the total. 24 - 1 = 23 months, but also 1 month from the first year. So 23 - 1 = 22 months and then add the 11 months from the second year. So 22 + 11 = 23 + 11 - 12 = 22. So the answer is {22}."

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>25 of Amésqueta's 150 men were sick</fact1>. This means that the remaining men are healthy. To find the number of healthy men, we subtract the number of sick men from the total number of men. <fact2>150 (total men)</fact2> - <fact1>25 (sick men)</fact1> = 125. However, the question asks for the number of men that were sick but are still healthy, which implies the number of men that were initially sick but recovered. Since the passage does not provide information on the recovery of the sick men, we can only determine the total number of healthy men, which is 125."

By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.

The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.

In 1685, the Qing used former Ming loyalist Han Chinese naval specialists who had served under the Zheng family in Taiwan in the siege of Albazin. Former Ming loyalist Han Chinese troops who had served under Zheng Chenggong and who specialized at fighting with rattan shields and swords  藤牌营 were recommended to the Kangxi Emperor to reinforce Albazin against the Russians. Kangxi was impressed by a demonstration of their techniques and ordered 500 of them to defend Albazin, under Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu, a former General of Wu Sangui. These rattan shield troops did not suffer a single casualty when they defeated and cut down Russian forces traveling by rafts on the river, only using the rattan shields and swords while fighting naked.

A year later, around <fact2>30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced</fact2>, and by 2014, this number decreased to <fact3>20,272 persons</fact3>. To find the number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes by 2014, we need to subtract the number of displaced persons in 2014 from the number of displaced Georgians a year after the war. However, the passage does not provide the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014, but rather the total number of displaced persons. Assuming that the 20,272 persons remaining displaced in 2014 include both Ossetians and Georgians, we cannot determine the exact number of Georgians who returned home. However, we can determine the number of Georgians who returned home between the year after the war and 2014. <fact2>30,000</fact2> - <fact3>20,272</fact3> = 9,728. So, at least 9,728 Georgians were able to return to their homes between the year after the war and 2014."

In the same year, 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line, after housing costs were taken into account. This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998-1999. How many £ difference is the poverty line of a single adult with no dependent children  compared to couples with no dependent children?

Answer: According to the passage, the poverty line for <fact1>single adults with no dependent children</fact1> is £115 per week, and for <fact2>couples with no dependent children</fact2> is £199 per week. The difference is <fact2>£199</fact2> - <fact1>£115</fact1> = £84. So the answer is {£84}."

That year, 37 Buick automobiles were made, production increasing to 750 in 1905, 1,400 in 1906, 4,641 in 1907, and 8,800 in 1908, taking the number one spot away from close competitors Oldsmobile, Ford Motor Company, and Maxwell automobile. How many Buick automobiles were built from 1899 thru 1907?","Reformatted Question: The first two Buick automobiles were made in <fact1>1899 and 1900</fact1> at the ""Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company"" by chief-engineer Walter Lorenzo Marr, but company owner David Dunbar Buick was reluctant to begin making automobiles, being satisfied with stationary and marine engine production, so Marr left Buick in <fact2>1901</fact2> to found Marr (automobile) under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in <fact3>1902</fact3> for Marrs valve-in-head (Overhead valve engine) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in <fact4>1904</fact4>. In <fact5>1903</fact5>, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in <fact4>1904</fact4> Buick, whose company was now called ""Buick Motor Company,"" moved to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind.

How many Buick automobiles were built from 1899 thru 1907?

Answer: According to the passage, the first two Buick automobiles were made in <fact1>1899 and 1900</fact1>, and the third Buick automobile was made in <fact5>1903</fact5>. Additionally, the passage states that <fact6>37 Buick automobiles were made</fact6> in <fact4>1904</fact4>, <fact7>750 in 1905</fact7>, <fact8>1,400 in 1906</fact8>, and <fact9>4,641 in 1907</fact9>. To find the total number of Buick automobiles built from 1899 thru 1907, we need to add the number of automobiles made in each year: 2 (1899-1900) + 1 (1903) + 37 (1904) + 750 (1905) + 1,400 (1906) + 4,641 (1907) = 6,831. So the answer is {6,831}."

nfl_1136_a16fc6ad-fb3d-4b4e-8da0-d87e49b6c17a," Looking to avoid back-to-back divisional losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots career.

Under Thigpen, the Chiefs' offense struggled to move the ball down the field. In using three quarterbacks, the Chiefs had only 65 net yards at halftime. Raiders RB Darren McFadden got a 19-yard TD run in the third quarter. Oakland increased its lead with Janikowski nailing a 40-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. The Chiefs would respond with rookie QB Tyler Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, Kansas City executed a two-point conversion pass to rookie FB Mike Cox to make them within 8 points with just over five minutes remaining. The Chiefs' two-point conversion was the team's first in two years. Kansas City lost its opportunity to tie the game as the Raiders pulled away with RB Michael Bush getting a 32-yard TD run. The Chiefs' defense allowed the third-highest total yards on offense in franchise history. <fact1>JaMarcus Russell completed only 6 of 17 passes for 55 yards</fact1> and led the Raiders to a 15-point victory. Following the game, Chiefs RB Larry Johnson voiced his displeasure with the Chiefs' offense and his role with the team. With the loss, the Chiefs fell to an 0-2 record for the third consecutive year. Kansas City's 11-game losing streak (2007-2008) is the longest in franchise history. The Chiefs also lost their second consecutive game to the Raiders for the first time since 2001.

Answer: According to the passage, the <fact1>2014 military budget was approximately US$69.3 billion</fact1> and the <fact2>2015 military budget was approximately US$83.7 billion</fact2>. To find the difference, we subtract the 2014 budget from the 2015 budget: <fact2>US$83.7 billion</fact2> - <fact1>US$69.3 billion</fact1> = US$14.4 billion. So the answer is {US$14.4 billion}."

Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500-3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of Austria until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss. The small group of bears living in the Carinthian-Slovenian Alps is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population.
