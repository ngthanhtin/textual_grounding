Answer:  The passage states that Kitna completed a 20-yard touchdown pass (<fact3>20 yards</fact3>) and Adrian Peterson had a 2-yard touchdown run (<fact2>2 yards</fact2>).  To find the difference, subtract the shorter distance from the longer distance: <fact3>20 yards</fact3> - <fact2>2 yards</fact2> = 18 yards.  Therefore, Kitna's touchdown pass was 18 yards longer than Adrian Peterson's touchdown run. The answer is {18}.

nfl_1981_c32b9ccf-b3ec-44d5-b8b2-2bda74abf00b," A power outage that disrupted play in the third quarter served as a fitting metaphor for the Giants' general lack of power on the field this night. Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham.

history_1082_dbdf36f7-a935-4b91-9cea-8f2942831ab7,"In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared.

Answer: The Danish fleet fired on the Swedish navy on <fact1>30 May 1563</fact1>. War was declared on <fact2>13 August 1563</fact2>.

To calculate the number of days, we need to consider the number of days in each month.

May has 31 days.  Days remaining in May after the 30th: 31 - 30 = 1 day

June has 30 days.
July has 31 days.
August has 13 days (until the 13th).

Total days: 1 + 30 + 31 + 13 = 75 days

Therefore, 75 days passed between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war.

He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumiñahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.:221-223,226 Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.:235-237 How many years after the uprising in 1536 where many natives were killed did Archaeologists find their remains near Lima?","Reformatted Question:  <fact1>The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007.</fact1> <fact2>Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536.</fact2> How many years after the uprising in 1536 where many natives were killed did Archaeologists find their remains near Lima?

Answer: The passage states that the remains of natives killed during the 1536 uprising were found in 2007.  To find the number of years between these two dates, we subtract: 2007 - 1536 = 471.  Therefore, the answer is {471}.

The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins, who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels. Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night. The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram. Gago was killed in action and his entire company was wiped out. Advancing forces faced another ferocious defensive attack between the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and the Nallur Weerakaliyamman temple.

The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh.In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.Between June 27-July 5 the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army  under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople  the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone.

Answer: The passage states that there was an unsuccessful attack on <fact1>August 5</fact1> and another on <fact1>September 25</fact1>.  To find the number of days between these dates, we calculate the number of days in August (31) after August 5th. This is 31 - 5 = 26 days. Then we add the number of days in September (30) to that. Therefore, there were 26 + 30 = 56 days between the two unsuccessful attacks. So the answer is {56}.

On their second offensive play from scrimmage, <fact1>Flacco threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Torrey Smith</fact1>. It was the first catch of Smith's career and the longest pass of Flacco's career. Before the first quarter was up, <fact2>Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for 41 and 18 yards respectively</fact2>, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie.

While  Popovo, Klek, and Sutorina were relinquished, they were still initially taken. Therefore,  Venice tried to take a minimum of 11 cities (Sinj twice, Herceg Novi, Knin, Vrgorac, and the seven cities taken in 1694).

Answer: The passage states that <fact2>56.2% of residents were between the ages of 18 and 24</fact2>.  To find the percentage who were *not* in this age range, we subtract this figure from 100%.  100% - <fact2>56.2%</fact2> = 43.8%. Therefore, 43.8% of residents were not between the ages of 18 and 24.  This is comprised of those under 18 (<fact1>10.1%</fact1>), those aged 25-44 (<fact3>16.1%</fact3>), those aged 45-64 (<fact4>10.5%</fact4>), and those 65 and older (<fact5>7%</fact5>).  10.1% + 16.1% + 10.5% + 7% = 43.7% (rounding differences may account for the slight discrepancy from 43.8%).

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia. It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed. How many more scribes than scholars were in the editorial board created in march of 1773?","Reformatted Question: Late in the 18th Century, Qing dynasty set about a momentous task, the creation of the Siku Quanshu. The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772.

It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed. How many more scribes than scholars were in the editorial board created in March of 1773?

Answer: The passage states that <fact2>the editorial board in March of 1773 included over 361 scholars</fact2> and <fact3>there were around 3,826 scribes</fact3>.  To find the difference, subtract the number of scholars from the number of scribes: 3,826 - 361 = 3465. Therefore, there were 3465 more scribes than scholars in the editorial board.  So the answer is {3465}.

history_1459_c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6,"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.

history_1233_30c4acad-427e-41b4-a076-326e0da2e210,"The irony of a Cardinal attacking the troops of a Pope was not lost on Rome, Spain, and ultra-Catholics in France. In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March. By this time Cardinal Richelieu remarked: How many more men larger was the army that began operations against Genoa than the reinforcements from Spain that were captured?","Reformatted Question: The passage states that a <fact1>30,000-strong army</fact1> began operations against Genoa, and <fact2>4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted</fact2>. How many more men were in the army attacking Genoa than the captured Spanish reinforcements?

Answer: The passage indicates that the army attacking Genoa numbered <fact1>30,000</fact1> men, while <fact2>4,000 Spanish reinforcements were captured</fact2>.  Subtracting the number of captured reinforcements from the size of the army gives us <fact1>30,000</fact1> - <fact2>4,000</fact2> = 26,000.  Therefore, the army attacking Genoa was 26,000 men larger than the captured Spanish reinforcements.  The answer is {26000}.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century?","Reformatted Question: Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. <fact1>Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1>, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. <fact2>Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917</fact2>.

How many more females per 100 age 18 and over were there than males?

Answer: The question asks for the difference between the number of females and males per 100 females aged 18 and over.  The passage states that <fact5>for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 173.2 males</fact5>.  Therefore, there were 100 females and 173.2 males. The difference is 173.2 - 100 = 73.2. However, the question asks how many *more* females there were than males.  Since there were more males than females, the answer is 0.  There were 73.2 *more* males than females per 100 females age 18 and over.  The question is phrased in a way that implies a positive answer, which is impossible given the data provided.  Therefore, the answer is {0} if interpreting ""how many more"" to mean the absolute difference and the number of additional females, and {-73.2} if interpreting the question literally.

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison.

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne. Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.

history_1578_d3bc4a55-84c8-4379-a2df-610e30794d1a,"Baldwin de Burg was a nephew of Baldwin I of Jerusalem and the Count of Edessa from 1100 to 1118. In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Pope Callixtus II sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem. The Venetians abandoned the siege of Corfu when they heard this news, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123.

history_1043_620840b6-98e8-445b-925f-825de189621d,"The Treaty of Karlowitz, signed in January 1699, confirmed the Venetian possession of Kephalonia, and the Morea with the island of Aigina, which became organized as the ""Kingdom of the Morea"" , divided into four provinces: Romania, with seat at Nafplion , Laconia, with seat at Monemvasia , Messenia, with seat at Navarino, and Achaea, with seat at Patras . The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000. Although the Venetians managed to restore some prosperity - the population allegedly rose to some 250,000 by 1708, probably driven by immigration - they failed to win the trust of their Greek Orthodox subjects, who were used to a relative autonomy under the Turks and resented the Venetian bureaucracy.

In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist.

In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets.

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma.

Answer:  <fact3>Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo in October 1599</fact3>. He <fact4>declared himself king on February 25, 1600</fact4>. From October 1599 to February 1600 there are: October (31 days), November (30 days), December (31 days), and January (31 days), plus 25 days in February.  This totals 148 days.  Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 148 days is approximately 148/30 = 4.9 months.  Therefore, he declared himself king approximately 5 months after sending the force.

Answer: The passage states that 51.6% of those aged 15 or over were economically active (<fact1>7,857,370 (51.6%) were economically active</fact1>).  To find the percentage that weren't economically active, we subtract this from 100%: 100% - 51.6% = 48.4%. Therefore, 48.4% of those aged 15 and over weren't economically active.

However, Green Bay would pull away in the fourth quarter as Rodgers got a 4-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT) and <fact2>completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Kuhn</fact2>. Starting quarterback Marc Bulger (3-of-4, 23 yards) left the game in the second quarter with an injury to his right shoulder. How many touchdown receptions did Packers wideouts score?

Answer: The passage states that Aaron Rodgers threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver (<fact1>).  There is no mention of any other touchdown receptions by Packers wide receivers. Therefore, Packers wideouts scored only one touchdown reception.  The other touchdowns scored by the Packers were a 1-yard run by John Kuhn, a 4-yard run by Aaron Rodgers and a 10-yard pass to John Kuhn (<fact2>). So the answer is {1}.

To find the combined percentage of the second and third largest age groups, we add their percentages: <fact3>26.50%</fact3> + <fact4>23.50%</fact4> = 50.00%.

Then, we subtract the percentage of the largest age group from the combined percentage of the second and third largest age groups: 50.00% - <fact7>26.20%</fact7> = 23.80%.

Therefore, there were 23.80% more people in the second and third largest age groups combined compared to the largest age group.  The answer is {23.8}.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz.

Answer: The passage states that Amésqueta's expedition started with <fact1>150 men</fact1>, and <fact2>25 of them were sick</fact2>.  To find the number of men who were not sick, subtract the number of sick men from the total number of men: <fact1>150</fact1> - <fact2>25</fact2> = 125. Therefore, 125 men were not sick.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal.

Answer: The passage states that Díaz de Velasco initially had a party of <fact1>25 men</fact1>.  After joining with the advance party at Río Chakal, his force increased to <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3>. The question asks for the number of *fighters*. While the porters and archers likely had some combat capability,  the passage clearly distinguishes between the soldiers (<fact2>49</fact2>) and the porters and archers (<fact3>34</fact3>).  Therefore, considering only the soldiers as confirmed fighters, Díaz had 49 fighters.  If we assume all porters and archers were also fighters, then the total would be 49 + 34 = 83. However, the question doesn't explicitly state that the porters and archers are fighters, hence the more precise answer is {49}.

A party, including Díaz de Velasco, set out from Mopán on <fact2>7 March 1696</fact2>, leaving some sick soldiers behind after five days of travel. How many days after Amésqueta's arrival at Mopán did they set out from Mopán, leaving sick soldiers behind?


Answer: Amésqueta arrived at Mopán on <fact1>February 25, 1696</fact1>. The party left Mopán on <fact2>March 7, 1696</fact2>.  The number of days between these dates is calculated as follows:

* February has 29 days in 1696 (a leap year).
* Days remaining in February after the 25th: 29 - 25 = 4 days
* Total days: 4 days (remaining in February) + 7 days (in March) = 11 days

Therefore, they set out 11 days after Amésqueta's arrival at Mopán.  The fact that they left sick soldiers behind after five days of travel is extraneous information to this calculation.  The answer is {11}.

By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.

Answer:  The passage states that the old age pension for a single person was raised by 300 francs to 1700 francs.  Therefore, the pension for a single person before the raise was 1700 - 300 = 1400 francs.  Similarly, the pension for a couple was raised by 300 francs per person (a total of 600 francs for the couple) to 3700 francs.  So, the pension for a couple before the raise was 3700 - 600 = 3100 francs. The combined total pension for a single person and a couple before the raise was 1400 + 3100 = 4500 francs.

The Chiefs tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 3-yard TD pass to Gonzalez after a very controversial Pass Interference call on Safety Clinton Hart, in which Gonzalez did not look for a flag, making the call even more controversial.  Fortunately, the Chargers' defense stopped both the 2-point conversion and the ensuing onside kick to preserve their much-needed victory. How many points did the Chargers score in the second quarter?

Answer: The passage states that in the second quarter, <fact1>the Chargers' kicker Nate Kaeding made a 34-yard field goal and a 26-yard field goal</fact1>.  Field goals are worth 3 points each. Therefore, the Chargers scored 34 + 26 = 60 points in total in the second quarter, but this is incorrect. Field goals are worth 3 points each. So, the Chargers scored 3 points + 3 points = 6 points in the second quarter.  The answer is {6}.

The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with Venetian troops. Gaston de Foix, recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 - 15,000 casualties.

Geng Jingzhong was executed; his brother Geng Juzhong 耿聚忠 was in Beijing with the Qing court with the Kangxi Emperor during the rebellion and was not punished for his brother's revolt. Geng Juzhong died of natural causes in 1687. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan , son of Zhu Yihai.

history_1306_cf084a28-2e17-4b61-a65b-95fb1afff749,"Russia accused Georgia of committing ""genocide"" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a 192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians. Many were able to return to their homes after the war, but a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. As of May 2014, 20,272 persons remained displaced, with their return being blocked by de facto authorities.

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>192,000 people were displaced</fact1>. A year after the war, <fact2>30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced</fact2>. By 2014, <fact3>20,272 persons remained displaced</fact3>.  To find the number of Georgians who returned, we subtract the number of Georgians still displaced in 2014 from the number displaced a year after the war: 30,000 - 20,272 = 9728.  Therefore, approximately 9,728 more Georgians were able to return to their homes between one year after the war and 2014.  However, this only accounts for the change in displaced Georgians; the original passage does not specify what proportion of the 192,000 displaced people were Georgian, and the total number that returned cannot be precisely determined without that information.

Answer:  The question asks for the difference between the total number of households and housing units and the number of families.

From the passage:
<fact2>Households</fact2> = 3,155
<fact4>Housing units</fact4> = 3,723
<fact3>Families</fact3> = 2,240

Total households and housing units = 3,155 + 3,723 = 6,878

Difference = Total households and housing units - Families = 6,878 - 2,240 = 4,638

Answer:  The passage states that <fact2>13.9%</fact2> of the <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> were of <fact3>Swedish</fact3> ancestry.  This equates to 0.139 * 7791 = 1082.5 people (approximately 1083).

Answer:  The census data shows that <fact2>33.7% of the 7,791 people were of German ancestry</fact2>.  To find the number of people of German ancestry, we calculate 0.337 * 7791 = 2625.207 ≈ 2625 people.

How many more people were German than Irish and Danish?

Answer:  The question asks the difference between the number of people of German ancestry and the combined number of people of Irish and Danish ancestry.

First, we calculate the number of people of Irish and Danish ancestry:
Irish: <fact3>10.1%</fact3> of <fact1>7,791</fact1> = 0.101 * 7791 = 786.971 ≈ 787 people
Danish: <fact4>5.4%</fact4> of <fact1>7,791</fact1> = 0.054 * 7791 = 420.954 ≈ 421 people
Total Irish and Danish: 787 + 421 = 1208 people

Next, we calculate the number of people of German ancestry:
German: <fact2>33.7%</fact2> of <fact1>7,791</fact1> = 0.337 * 7791 = 2626.227 ≈ 2626 people

Finally, we find the difference:
Difference: 2626 - 1208 = 1418 people

So the answer is {1418}.

How many areas used napalm in only one year?

Answer:  The provided text mentions several instances of napalm use spanning multiple years. To determine how many areas used napalm in only one year, we must examine each instance:

* **France:** Used napalm over multiple years in the First Indochina War (<fact1>1946-1954</fact1>) and the Algerian War of Independence (<fact2>1954-1962</fact2>).
* **Israel:** Used napalm in the Six-Day War (<fact4>1967</fact4>).  This is one year.
* **Nigeria:** Used napalm in <fact5>1969</fact5>. This is one year.
* **India and Pakistan:** Used napalm in <fact6>1965 and 1971</fact6>. This is not a single year.
* **Egypt:** Used napalm in <fact7>1973</fact7>. This is one year.
* **Morocco:** Used napalm over multiple years in the Western Sahara War (<fact8>1975-1991</fact8>).
* **Argentina:** Used napalm in <fact9>1982</fact9>. This is one year.
* **Iran:** Used napalm over multiple years (<fact10>1980-88</fact10>).
* **Iraq:** Used napalm over multiple years (<fact11>1980-88, 1991</fact11>).
* **Angola:** The passage doesn't specify the years of napalm use during the Angolan Civil War, but it's likely more than one.
* **Yugoslav Wars:**  The passage mentions napalm use over multiple years (<fact12>1991-1996</fact12>).

Based on this analysis, the areas that used napalm in only one year are Israel (1967), Nigeria (1969), Egypt (1973), and Argentina (1982). Therefore, the answer is {4}.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter.

How many people live in Lausanne?

Answer:  The question provides the percentage of the population for each age group and the number of people in each age group. To find the total population, we can use any of the given percentages and their corresponding population numbers.  Let's use the fact that <fact1>11,818 people represent 9.4% of the population</fact1>.

We can set up a proportion:

11,818 / 0.094 = x / 1

Solving for x (the total population):

x = 11,818 / 0.094 
x ≈ 125723.4

Let's verify this using another age group. <fact2>12,128 people represent 9.7% of the population</fact2>.

12,128 / 0.097 = x / 1

x = 12,128 / 0.097
x ≈ 125185.6

The slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the percentages provided.  A more accurate total would involve summing all the population figures in each age group: 11818 + 12128 + 21101 + 22158 + 18016 + 13940 + 11041 + 8277 + 5896 + 1171 = 125546.

How many more people are there 60 and over than there are 19 and under?

Answer:  The question asks for the difference between the number of people aged 60 and over and the number of people aged 19 and under.

First, let's find the total number of people aged 19 and under.  From the passage, we know that <fact1>there are 11,818 people aged 0-9</fact1> and <fact2>12,128 people aged 10-19</fact2>.  Adding these together: 11,818 + 12,128 = 23,946 people aged 19 and under.

Next, let's find the total number of people aged 60 and over. The passage states: <fact3>11,041 people are aged 60-69</fact3>, <fact4>8,277 people are aged 70-79</fact4>, <fact5>5,896 people are aged 80-89</fact5>, and <fact6>1,171 people are aged 90+</fact6>. Adding these together: 11,041 + 8,277 + 5,896 + 1,171 = 26,385 people aged 60 and over.

Finally, subtract the number of people aged 19 and under from the number of people aged 60 and over: 26,385 - 23,946 = 2,439.

Therefore, there are 2,439 more people aged 60 and over than there are people aged 19 and under.  The answer is {2439}.

Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China.

How many total days was the gap between the two number 1 periods for the Synchronicity album?

Answer:  The passage states that <fact1>Synchronicity was #1 from July 23, 1983 to September 3, 1983</fact1>.  To find the number of days, we calculate the difference between these dates. There are 31 days in July.  From July 23rd to July 31st is 8 days. Adding the 31 days of August and the 3 days of September gives us 8 + 31 + 3 = 42 days.

The passage also states that <fact2>Synchronicity was #1 again from September 17, 1983 to November 19, 1983</fact2>. The gap between these periods starts on September 4th and ends on September 16th. There are 13 days in this gap (September 16th - September 3rd = 13 days).

Therefore, the total gap between the two number 1 periods is 13 days.  So the answer is {13}.

Answer:  The passage states that <fact1>the Broncos jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the first quarter</fact1>.  A touchdown is worth 6 points and a field goal is worth 3 points. Therefore, the Broncos scored one touchdown (6 points) and one field goal (3 points) for a total of 9 points. <fact2>The Rams scored their first points with a 36-yard touchdown pass</fact2>. Before this touchdown, the Broncos had a 10-point lead. Since a touchdown is 6 points, the Rams were 10/6 = 1.66 scores behind before they scored their first points.  Rounding to the nearest whole score, the Rams were 2 scores behind.
