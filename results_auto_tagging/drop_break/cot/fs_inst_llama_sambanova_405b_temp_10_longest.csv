Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham.

According to the passage, the percentages are:
- Native American: 0.15%
- Asian: 0.28%
- Pacific Islander: 0.02%
- Other races: 0.36%
- Two or more races: 0.74%

However, this calculation does not take into account the fact that some people who are Hispanic or Latino may also be counted in one of the other categories. Therefore, the actual percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American may be slightly lower than 2.48% + the percentage of people who were solely Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, other races and two or more races.

Since the Hispanic or Latino category can include people of any race, we should subtract the percentage of Hispanic or Latino from the total to avoid counting them twice.

The total percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is:
0.15 + 0.28 + 0.02 + 0.36 + 0.74 = 1.55%

Then, add the 0.93% people who were solely Hispanic or Latino.
However, the 0.93% of the people who were Hispanic or Latino were also counted in the above categories. We should only add the 0.93% - 0.55% = 0.38% to the 1.55%. 0.55% is the overlap between the 0.93% and 1.55%.

The Saints scored a touchdown (7 points) when DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone. They also scored another touchdown (7 points) when WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse. Additionally, Saints kicker John Carney kicked three field goals: a 37-yarder, a 51-yarder, and a 20-yarder, each worth 3 points.

history_1082_dbdf36f7-a935-4b91-9cea-8f2942831ab7,"In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared. At sea a battle broke out near Öland on 11 September, whereafter the war took a pause. How many days passed between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war?","To find the number of days between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates given in the passage.

The Danish fleet fired on the Swedish navy on 30 May 1563, and war was declared on 13 August 1563. 

First, let's find the number of days in May from the 30th to the end of the month, which is 1 day (31 - 30 = 1).
Then, we have the full months of June (30 days) and July (31 days).
Lastly, we have 13 days in August.

Now, let's add up the days: 1 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 13 (August) = 75.

So, the number of days between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war is 75.

Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders.

How many months after the truce of the War of Independence was called did the entire island of Ireland become the Irish Free State?","To find out how many months after the truce of the War of Independence was called did the entire island of Ireland become the Irish Free State, we need to calculate the difference in months between July 1921 (when the truce was called) and December 1922 (when the island became the Irish Free State).

From July 1921 to December 1921 is 6 months (in the same year).
From 1921 to 1922 is 1 year, which is 12 months.
From January 1922 to December 1922 is 12 months.

So, the total number of months is 6 + 12 + 12 = 30 months, but since the truce was called in July and the island became the Irish Free State in December, we subtract 6 months from the 12 months of 1921 (because the truce was called in July, 6 months have already passed in 1921) to get 6 months for 1921. Then we add the 12 months of 1922 to get 18 months.

However, the correct calculation is from July 1921 to July 1922 is 12 months, and from July 1922 to December 1922 is 6 months (5 months from July to December, but since the question is asking for the number of months ""after"" the truce was called, we include the month of December as well). 

So, the correct total number of months is 12 + 6 = 18 months, but since the month of July 1921 has already passed when the truce was called, we include the month of December 1922 as well, but we should not include the month of July 1921. Therefore, the correct calculation is from August 1921 to December 1922 which is 16 months.

However, the question asks for how many months ""after"" the truce was called, so we include the month of July 1921 as well, but we should not include the month of July 1921 because the truce was called in July 1921, so we calculate from August 1921 to December 1922 which is 16 months, but we should calculate from July 1921 to December 1922 which is 17 months.

The Anglo-Irish Treaty was negotiated from 11 October to 6 December 1921. The entire island of Ireland became the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922.

First, let's find the difference in years: 1922 - 1921 = 1 year

Since there are 365 days in a year, we multiply the year difference by 365: 1 * 365 = 365 days

Now, we need to find the difference in days between the dates 6 December and 6 December, which is 0 days, as they are the same day.

However, we need to add the days from 6 December 1921 to 31 December 1921, which is 25 days (since December has 31 days and 6th is already included in the previous year), and then the days from 1 January 1922 to 6 December 1922, which is 335 days (since 6 December is the 340th day of the year, excluding the 5 days from the previous year).

But for simplicity, we can just add 365 days to the 0 days difference between 6 December and 6 December.

So, the total number of days is: 365 days

The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins, who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels. Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night. The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram.

The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins, who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels. Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night.

history_187_5e325403-9c54-48ed-88fd-2b3d8c26baf1,"The first Azov campaign began in the spring of 1695. Peter the Great ordered his army  to advance towards Azov. The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh.In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.Between June 27-July 5 the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army  under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople  the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone. How many days were there between the two unsuccessful attacks?","To find the number of days between the two unsuccessful attacks, we need to calculate the difference between the dates of the two attacks. 

The first attack was on August 5 and the second attack was on September 25. 

August has 31 days, so from August 5 to August 31, there are 26 days. 
September has 30 days, so from September 1 to September 25, there are 25 days. 

In total, there are 26 + 25 = 51 days between the two attacks.

The Texans trailed early after QB Kerry Collins threw a 3 and a 1-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington and to WR Justin Gage. This was followed by RB Chris Johnson getting an 11-yard TD run. The Texans got on the scoreboard after kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard field goal, but fell further behind after kkicker Rob Bironas hit a 30-yard field goal. The Texans tried to cut the lead with QB Matt Schaub getting a 12-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Titans would pull away with RB Javon Ringer getting a 7-yard TD run. The Texans tried to come back into the game, but only came away with Schaub throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. With the loss, the Texans fell to 5-9, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention. How many yards longer was the longest touchdown reception than the shortest?","To find the difference in yards between the longest and shortest touchdown receptions, we need to identify the lengths of all the touchdown receptions mentioned in the passage. 

The lengths of the touchdown receptions are: 
- 1 yard (to WR Justin Gage)
- 3 yards (to WR Nate Washington)
- 12 yards (to WR Andre Johnson)
- 4 yards (to WR Kevin Walter)

The longest touchdown reception is 12 yards, and the shortest is 1 yard. 

Now, we can calculate the difference: 
12 yards (longest) - 1 yard (shortest) = 11 yards

However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in 1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II.

How many cities did Ottomon attack to retaliate for Polijica?","To answer this question, we need to identify the cities that the Ottomans attacked in retaliation for Poljica's rebellion. According to the passage, the Ottomans attacked the following cities:

1. Zadvarje (in June 1685)
2. Dolac (in July 1686)
3. Srijane (in July 1686)

These are the cities mentioned in the passage as being attacked by the Ottomans in retaliation for Poljica's rebellion.

history_1042_8d1d1067-668e-47c9-9c68-4047b59b178b,"In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today.

How many cities did Venice try to take?","To find the number of cities Venice tried to take, we need to analyze the passage and identify the cities mentioned as being besieged or taken by Venice.

The cities mentioned in the passage as being besieged or taken by Venice are:

1. Sinj (besieged in 1684 and 1685, and finally taken in 1686)
2. Zadvarje (attacked by Ottomans in 1685, but not taken by Venice)
3. Dolac (attacked by Ottomans in 1686, but not taken by Venice)
4. Srijane (attacked by Ottomans in 1686, but not taken by Venice)
5. Herceg Novi (taken in 1687)
6. Knin (taken in 1688)
7. Vrgorac (taken in 1690)
8. Imotski (route opened towards it in 1690, but not explicitly stated as taken)
9. Mostar (route opened towards it in 1690, but not explicitly stated as taken)
10. Čitluk (taken in 1694)
11. Gabela (taken in 1694)
12. Zažablje (taken in 1694)
13. Trebinje (taken in 1694)
14. Popovo (taken in 1694, but later relinquished)
15. Klobuk (taken in 1694)
16. Metković (taken in 1694)

However, we should note that Zadvarje, Dolac, and Srijane were not taken by Venice, but rather defended against Ottoman attacks. Imotski and Mostar are also not explicitly stated as being taken by Venice, but rather as having a route opened towards them.

Therefore, the number of cities Venice actually tried to take is 13: Sinj, Herceg Novi, Knin, Vrgorac, Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk, Metković, and also Klek and Sutorina which were relinquished.

The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000. Although the Venetians managed to restore some prosperity - the population allegedly rose to some 250,000 by 1708, probably driven by immigration - they failed to win the trust of their Greek Orthodox subjects, who were used to a relative autonomy under the Turks and resented the Venetian bureaucracy.

Şahin Bey entered Serbia with 20.000 akinjis at that time he learned that Serbian lords had prepared an army to attack his troops. He advanced to Pločnik near Prokuplje but could not detect the position of that army, and believed that there was none. At that time, many akinjis  lost their temper and began looting civilian properties in the surrounding villages by disobeying orders. Şahin Bey stayed alone with 2,000 soldiers. On the other hand, the battlefield was observed by Serbian expeditionary forces. Suddenly an allied army with 30,000 soldiers appeared, many of whom were cavalry. The Serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charge with horse archers on the flanks. The Serbs first attacked the Ottoman center , although they were unprepared and tasted nasty shock to heavy Serbian knights, the outnumbered Ottoman center resisted for some time but later began to withdraw with Şahin Bey who barely escaped with his life. Then the Serbian army turned to the other 18,000 akinjis that were busy plundering; unprepared, ill-disciplined, surprised akinjis couldn't do anything without their general. Only 5,000 of them returned home alive. More than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. According to tradition Serbian knight and folk hero Miloš Obilić participated in this battle and distinguished himself, and was wounded by an Ottoman arrow. According to some, such as Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klaić, Lazar's army was aided by Bosnian troops. One version of the battle has it that the battle was won thanks to the Bosnian troops and the trickery of a Kastrioti. How many of the akinjis died?","To find out how many of the akinjis died, we need to first determine the total number of akinjis and then subtract the number of akinjis that returned home alive. 

According to the passage, Şahin Bey entered Serbia with 20,000 akinjis. Later, it is mentioned that 18,000 akinjis were busy plundering while Şahin Bey stayed alone with 2,000 soldiers. 

Since 5,000 of the akinjis returned home alive, we can calculate the number of akinjis that died by subtracting the number of survivors from the total number of akinjis that were plundering and with Şahin Bey. 

So, the total number of akinjis that died is 20,000 - 5,000 = 15,000.

However, we can also calculate the percentage of akinjis that died, which is given in the passage as more than 60% of the Ottoman army. 

Since the total number of akinjis is 20,000, we can calculate the number of akinjis that died by finding 60% of 20,000.

60% of 20,000 is 0.6 * 20,000 = 12,000.

But the passage states that more than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. So, the actual number of akinjis that died is more than 12,000.

However, our initial calculation shows that 15,000 akinjis died, which is indeed more than 12,000.

Answer: {15,000}."

history_1459_c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6,"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?","According to the passage, the population of Acalan in 1525 was estimated to be at least 10,000, and in 1553, the population was recorded at around 4,000.

How many yards longer was the longest offensive touchdown run versus the shortest?","To find the difference in yards between the longest and shortest touchdown runs, we need to identify the lengths of the touchdown runs mentioned in the passage. 

The longest touchdown run mentioned is Julius Jones' 27-yard run. 
The shortest touchdown run mentioned is T.J. Duckett's 1-yard run and Frank Gore's 2-yard run. Since 1 yard is shorter than 2 yards, we will use the 1-yard run for our calculation.

Now, we subtract the length of the shortest touchdown run from the length of the longest touchdown run: 27 yards - 1 yard = 26 yards.

The largest French ships of the period were the Soleil Royal and the Royal Louis. Each rated for 120 guns, they never carried their full complement. These ships were too large for practical purposes. The former only sailed on one campaign and was destroyed at La Hogue; the latter languished in port until sold in 1694. By the 1680s, French ship-design was at least equal to its English and Dutch counterparts, and by the Nine Years' War the French fleet had surpassed ships of the Royal Navy, whose designs stagnated in the 1690s. Innovation in the Royal Navy, however, did not cease.

In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March. By this time Cardinal Richelieu remarked: How many more men larger was the army that began operations against Genoa than the reinforcements from Spain that were captured?","To find the difference in the number of men between the army that began operations against Genoa and the reinforcements from Spain that were captured, we need to subtract the number of captured Spanish reinforcements from the total number of men in the army.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Browns struck first as CB Daven Holly returned an interception 57 yards for a touchdown.  Later, kicker Phil Dawson completed a 23-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Steelers kicker Jeff Reed completed a 43-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the true nature of the rivalry would commence.  Dawson would give Cleveland a 35-yard field goal, but Pittsburgh responded with QB Ben Roethlisberger completing a 20-yard TD pass to rookie WR Santonio Holmes.  WR Josh Cribbs would return a kick off 92 yards for a touchdown to give the Browns a 20-10 lead.  However, the Steelers would take the lead with RB Willie Parker getting a 1-yard TD run and a 4-yard touchdown reception.  The Browns final drive of the game almost came up successful, but QB Charlie Frye's 22-yard pass to WR Braylon Edwards fell incomplete.  With the loss, Cleveland fell to last place in the AFC North at 3-7. How many yards longer was the longest field goal over the second longest?","To find the difference in yards between the longest and second longest field goals, we need to identify the lengths of the field goals mentioned in the passage. 

The passage mentions the following field goals: 
- Phil Dawson's 23-yard field goal
- Jeff Reed's 43-yard field goal
- Phil Dawson's 35-yard field goal

The longest field goal is 43 yards, and the second longest is 35 yards. 

To find the difference, we subtract the length of the second longest field goal from the length of the longest field goal: 
43 - 35 = 8

So, the longest field goal was 8 yards longer than the second longest.

history_1313_797e963c-52f2-4f8e-ba70-5a382cda0d85,"Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century?","According to the passage, Russia suffered two revolutions in the early 20th century: the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the February Revolution of 1917.

How many more females per 100 age 18 and over were there than males?","To find the number of more females per 100 age 18 and over than males, we first need to understand the given ratio. The passage states that for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 173.2 males. This means that the number of males is more than the number of females.

Since we are looking for the number of more females than males, we can see that the number of males is actually more than the number of females. So, we need to find the difference in the other direction.

The correct calculation would be the difference between the number of males and 100 females, which is 173.2 - 100 = 73.2. However, this is the number of more males than females. Since the question asks for the number of more females than males, the answer would be the negative of this difference.

But since we are looking for the number of more females than males, and the actual result is more males than females, we can conclude that there are no more females than males. In fact, there are more males than females.

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly ""Redshanks"" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained.

2.

3. Kicker David Akers made a 46-yard field goal (3 points).
4. Kicker David Akers made a 28-yard field goal (3 points).

Now, let's add up the points: 
3 (first field goal) + 6 (touchdown) + 3 (second field goal) + 3 (third field goal) = 15 points.

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne.

The Treaty of Bucharest was signed on 7 May 1918, and it was renounced in October 1918. Since the exact date of renouncement in October is not provided, we will assume it to be the first day of the month for the sake of calculation.

May has 31 days, so from 7 May to the end of May, the treaty was in effect for approximately 24 days. Then there are June (30 days), July (31 days), August (31 days), and September (30 days), which add up to 122 days. 

From 1 October to the day it was renounced (assuming 1 October for simplicity), we don't need to count any additional days because we're only calculating full months. 

Converting the days into months from May to September gives us approximately 5 months (since 24 days in May and the full months of June, July, August, and September).

The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000. Although the Venetians managed to restore some prosperity - the population allegedly rose to some 250,000 by 1708, probably driven by immigration - they failed to win the trust of their Greek Orthodox subjects, who were used to a relative autonomy under the Turks and resented the Venetian bureaucracy.

How many more deaths occurred on the Bavarian side than on the Austrian side?","To find out how many more deaths occurred on the Bavarian side than on the Austrian side, we need to subtract the number of deaths on the Austrian side from the number of deaths on the Bavarian side. 

According to the passage, the number of deaths on the Bavarian side in the battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, and the Austrians lost only about 40 men. 

1,100 (Bavarian deaths) - 40 (Austrian deaths) = 1,060

So, there were 1,060 more deaths on the Bavarian side than on the Austrian side.

According to the passage, the number of deaths on the Bavarian side in the battle of Sendling's Night of Murder is estimated at around 1,100 men, while the Austrians lost only about 40 men. 

The difference in casualty numbers can be calculated by subtracting the number of Austrian casualties from the number of Bavarian casualties: 1,100 (Bavarian casualties) - 40 (Austrian casualties) = 1,060.

However, the passage also mentions another battle, the Battle of Aidenbach, where the Bavarians suffered about 4,000 casualties. Since the passage does not provide information on Austrian casualties for this battle, we can only calculate the difference in casualty numbers for the battle of Sendling's Night of Murder.

But if we want to know the total difference, we have to assume that the 40 Austrian casualties is the total for both battles, which is unlikely but we have no other data.

So for the first battle the difference is 1,060 and for the second battle, if we assume 0 casualties for the Austrian side is 4,000.

So the total estimated difference is 1,060 + 4,000 = 5,060.

In 1669, Louis Laneau, Bishop of Motella, also a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, was named head of a Roman Catholic mission in mainland Southeast Asia, with his headquarters at Ayutthaya. They propagated the Christian faith and also took care of Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Thailand.

The hospital provided medical care to about 200-300 people daily. During a 1670 trip to France, Pallu obtained from Louis XIV a letter to King Narai, which, together with a letter from the Pope, he remitted in Ayutthaya in October 1673 and which was received with great reverence.

Starting quarterback Marc Bulger (3-of-4, 23 yards) left the game in the second quarter with an injury to his right shoulder. How many touchdown receptions did Packers wideouts score?","To find the number of touchdown receptions scored by Packers wideouts, we need to analyze the passage and identify the relevant information. The passage mentions two touchdown receptions by Packers players: a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver and a 10-yard touchdown pass to fullback John Kuhn. However, since the question specifically asks about Packers wideouts, we should only consider the touchdown reception by Donald Driver.

The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 95.90 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.50 males. How many more people, in terms of percentage, were in the 2nd and 3rd largest age groups combined compared to the largest?","To find the answer, we need to first identify the largest, 2nd largest, and 3rd largest age groups. 

The age groups and their percentages are:
- Under 18: 26.20%
- 18-24: 9.30%
- 25-44: 26.50%
- 45-64: 23.50%
- 65 and older: 14.60%

The largest age group is 25-44 with 26.50%, but since 26.20% is very close to 26.50%, we can say the largest group is actually the combined 26.20% and 26.50% groups, but in this case we have two largest groups that are almost tied, the under 18 and 25-44 groups. However, the 25-44 group is slightly larger. Therefore the largest group is 25-44, the 2nd largest is under 18 and the 3rd largest is 45-64.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of people in the 2nd and 3rd largest age groups combined:
26.20% (2nd largest) + 23.50% (3rd largest) = 49.70%

The largest age group is 25-44 with 26.50%. 

Now, let's calculate the difference between the 2nd and 3rd largest age groups combined and the largest age group:
49.70% - 26.50% = 23.20%

So, there are 23.20% more people in the 2nd and 3rd largest age groups combined compared to the largest age group.

The passage mentions the following groups:
- 25 men initially with Diaz
- An advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort (no specific number given, but the total after combining is 49 soldiers)
- 34 porters and archers from Verapaz

Since the initial 25 men and the advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort combined to form 49 soldiers, we can consider them as two military forces that combined to form one group of soldiers. The 34 porters and archers from Verapaz can be considered as another separate group.

Therefore, Diaz had a total of 2 different military forces combined (the group of 49 soldiers and the group of 34 porters and archers).

How many days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán leaving sick soldiers behind?","To find out how many days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán, we need to look at the dates mentioned in the passage. 

Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696. Then, Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake and they set out from Mopán on 7 March.

Since February has 28 or 29 days, we can calculate the difference between the two dates as follows: 
7 (March) - 25 (February) = 12 days (since 7 - 25 is negative, we add the remaining days of February to get the correct difference).

However, considering that the year 1696 is a leap year, February would have 29 days. But this does not affect our calculation.

So, the correct difference is 12 days.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.

Harsh enslavement by Spanish colonists, as well as redirection of food supplies and labor towards the colonists, had a devastating impact on both mortality and fertility over the first quarter century. Colonial administrators and Dominican and Hyeronimite priests observed that the search for gold and agrarian enslavement through the encomienda system were depressing population. Demographic data from two provinces in 1514 shows a low birth rate consistent with a 3.5% annual population decline. Just 14,000 Taínos survived in 1517. In 1503 the colony began to import Ethnic groups of Africa slaves after a charter was passed in 1501 allowing the import of slaves by Ferdinand and Isabel. The Spanish believed Africans would be more capable of performing physical labor. From 1519 to 1533, the indigenous uprising known as Enriquillos Revolt ensued, resulting from escaped African slaves on the island possibly working with the Taino people. How many years did the uprising of the Enriquillos Revolt last?","To find the number of years the Enriquillos Revolt lasted, we need to subtract the starting year from the ending year.

In some Polish sources it is also referred as the ""War of 1920"" . There is disagreement over the dates of the war. The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its article with the date range 1919-1920 but then states, ""Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state Józef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura  and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May.""

The autonomous community of Castile and León was created in response to public demand in 1983, and it recognized April 23 as an official holiday in 1986.  Similarly, each February 3 since 1988 has been celebrated by the Castilian nationalist party Tierra Comunera in Toledo.

The total number of prisoners is 293. 

- 100 were pardoned later

So, the total number of prisoners who were pardoned, purchased amnesty, or were executed, or died in prison is 100 + 50 + 23 + 20 = 193.

However, this 100 includes the prisoners whose fates are unknown and the ones who were not pardoned, purchased amnesty, or were executed but died in prison is not the same as being executed so we will still count those who died in prison.

In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new ""Academic Library"" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Viennas University Library is the largest collection of books in Austria, still facing problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries.

history_1837_094a5ed5-4e52-4258-841f-c6e01088c3fe,"From the 17th century onwards, interest in the old library, with its manuscripts and incunabulae, went into decline and the modern library in the Jesuit College came to the fore. In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new ""Academic Library"" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Viennas University Library is the largest collection of books in Austria, still facing problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries. How many books did the main library have in 1884, plus the volumes held in the Main Building on the Ring?","To find the total number of books the main library had in 1884, plus the volumes held in the Main Building on the Ring, we need to add the number of books the main library had and the number of volumes the Main Building on the Ring could hold. 

According to the passage, the main library had 300,000 books in 1884. The Main Building on the Ring had stacks for 500,000 volumes. 

300,000 (main library books) + 500,000 (Main Building capacity) = 800,000

So the answer is {800,000}."

Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead. Neil Rackers set up for a kick with less than 15&#160;seconds to play in order to send the 23-20 contest into overtime.  Rackers missed the uprights by a foot with seconds left in the game. How many quarters did Dante Hall play in?","To determine how many quarters Dante Hall played in, we need to look at the information provided in the passage. According to the passage, Dante Hall was injured on the opening kickoff and left the game. This implies that he played for a very short time, likely only a few minutes, and did not participate in the rest of the game.

Since a standard football game is divided into four quarters, and Dante Hall was injured at the very beginning of the game, it is likely that he only played in the first quarter, and only for a brief moment.

The passage mentions the following touchdowns by the Ravens: 
- A 62-yard catch and run TD by Derrick Mason (first half, but not specified which quarter)
- A 59-yard rushing TD by Ray Rice (first half, near the end of the second quarter)

- 2 by Willis McGahee: first an 8-yard run, then a 19-yard run (second half, but not specified which quarter)
- A Troy Smith 15-yard run (fourth quarter)

Since the question specifically asks for the third quarter, we can exclude the touchdowns that occurred in the first half and the fourth quarter. This leaves us with the touchdowns by Le'Ron McClain and Willis McGahee, which are mentioned to have occurred in the second half but not specifically in which quarter.

However, considering the order of events described in the passage, it is likely that the touchdowns by Le'Ron McClain and Willis McGahee occurred in the third quarter, as the passage mentions that ""In the second half the Ravens scored 4 consecutive touchdowns"" and later mentions that ""In the fourth quarter, the Ravens capped off their huge victory when Troy Smith ran in a TD from 15 yards."" This implies that the other three touchdowns likely occurred in the third quarter.

Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old. How many £ was the cost for a year of the garrisons in Calais and Brest and what military expeditions could consume?","To answer this question, we need to identify the costs mentioned in the passage for the garrisons in Calais and Brest, and for the military expeditions. 

The passage states that the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone were costing £36,000 a year to maintain. Additionally, it mentions that military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months.

However, the question asks for the cost of the garrisons in Calais and Brest for a year and what military expeditions could consume, but it does not specify the time frame for the military expeditions. Given the information provided, we can only assume the six-month time frame for the military expeditions, but to make a fair comparison, we should calculate the cost of the military expeditions for a year as well.

To calculate the yearly cost of the military expeditions, we need to multiply the six-month cost by 2, since there are two six-month periods in a year. 

£50,000 * 2 = £100,000 per year.

So, the garrisons in Calais and Brest cost £36,000 a year, and the military expeditions could consume £100,000 in a year.

In Game 2, the Mavericks won 113-92. 113 - 92 = 21 points.

In Game 3, the Mavericks won, but the score is not explicitly stated as a win by a certain number of points. However, we can infer that since the Spurs were up 108-106 and then the Mavericks won, they must have won by 1 or 2 points (depending on whether the buzzer-beater was a 2-pointer or a 3-pointer). However, since the passage does not explicitly state the score after the buzzer-beater, we cannot determine the exact number of points the Mavericks won by in Game 3.

In Game 6, the Mavericks won 113-111. 113 - 111 = 2 points.

Since the question asks how many points the Mavericks won by, we can provide the points for the games we have the information for. However, the question is phrased in a way that implies a single answer, so we will provide the answer for one of the games. Let's choose Game 2.

Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued.

The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints. How many touchdowns occurred in the first half?","To find the number of touchdowns in the first half, we need to analyze the events described in the passage that occurred during the first and second quarters.

How many yards longer was Cutler's longest touchdown pass than his shortest?","To find the difference in yards between Cutler's longest and shortest touchdown passes, we need to identify the lengths of all his touchdown passes mentioned in the passage. 

Cutler's touchdown passes were 7 yards to Greg Olsen, 2 yards to Desmond Clark, 20 yards to Earl Bennett, and 39 yards to Devin Aromashodu. 

The longest touchdown pass was 39 yards, and the shortest was 2 yards. 

To find the difference, we subtract the shortest from the longest: 39 - 2 = 37.

With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints. how many yards did cutler increase with?","To find out how many yards Cutler increased with, we need to look at the specific plays mentioned in the passage where Cutler is involved. 

In the second quarter, Cutler fired a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. 
In the third quarter, Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark increased the Bears' lead. 
In the fourth quarter, Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. 
In overtime, Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu won the game for the Bears.

However, the question asks how many yards Cutler increased with, and it seems to be referring to field goals or some form of score increase by Gould, the kicker, after a specific action by Cutler. In that case, we can look at the following information:

In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. Then they increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal.

It seems that the 42-yard and 41-yard field goals are not directly related to Cutler's actions. However, after Cutler's 7-yard TD pass, there is no mention of a field goal that directly relates to Cutler increasing the lead by a certain number of yards.

But if we look at another part of the passage, we can see that:

In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal.

It seems that the increase in yards is actually referring to the field goals by Gould. The first field goal was 22 yards, and the second was 42 yards. The difference between these two field goals is 20 yards (42 - 22 = 20). However, this does not seem to be directly related to Cutler.

If we look at another part of the passage, we can see that:

The Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal.

In this case, the increase in yards seems to be from 42 yards to 41 yards, but this is actually a decrease of 1 yard, not an increase. However, if we look at the increase from the 7-yard TD pass to the 41-yard field goal, we can see that the increase is actually 34 yards (41 - 7 = 34). However, this is still not a direct increase by Cutler.

If we look at the passage again, we can see that:

In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen.

It seems that the increase in yards is actually referring to the increase from the previous field goal (22 yards) to the 42-yard field goal, but this is not directly related to Cutler. However, if we look at the increase from the 22-yard field goal to the 7-yard TD pass by Cutler, and then the subsequent 42-yard field goal by Gould, we can see that the increase from the 22-yard field goal to the 42-yard field goal is 20 yards, but this is not directly related to Cutler. The increase from the 22-yard field goal to the 7-yard TD pass by Cutler is not an increase, but rather a decrease of 15 yards (22 - 7 = 15).

However, if we look at the increase from the 7-yard TD pass by Cutler to the 42-yard field goal by Gould, we can see that the increase is actually 35 yards (42 - 7 = 35).

How many more total yards of field goals did Robbie Gould make than Ryan Longwell?","To find out how many more total yards of field goals Robbie Gould made than Ryan Longwell, we need to calculate the total yards of field goals made by each kicker. 

According to the passage, Robbie Gould made field goals of 22 yards, 42 yards, and 41 yards, and also missed a 45-yard field goal attempt. However, the missed attempt is not included in the total yards made. So, the total yards of field goals made by Gould is 22 + 42 + 41 = 105 yards.

Ryan Longwell made a 41-yard field goal. So, the total yards of field goals made by Longwell is 41 yards.

Now, we subtract the total yards made by Longwell from the total yards made by Gould to find the difference: 105 - 41 = 64 yards.

According to the passage, Jay Cutler's longest touchdown pass was 39 yards to Devin Aromashodu, and another 20-yard touchdown pass is mentioned. However, a 20-yard pass is not his longest. Brett Favre's longest touchdown pass mentioned was 6 yards to both Visanthe Shiancoe and Sidney Rice.

Since we are comparing the longest touchdown passes, we will use the 39-yard pass for Jay Cutler and the 6-yard pass for Brett Favre. 

Now, we can calculate the difference: 39 yards (Jay Cutler's longest pass) - 6 yards (Brett Favre's longest pass) = 33 yards.

According to the passage, Mehlhaff's longest field goal mentioned was 23 yards. Kaeding's longest field goal mentioned was 33 yards and also 31 yards. Since 33 is greater than 31, we will use 33 for the comparison.

Now, we subtract Mehlhaff's longest field goal from Kaeding's longest field goal: 33 - 23 = 10.

So, Kaeding's longest field goal was 10 yards longer than Mehlhaff's longest field goal.

history_1306_cf084a28-2e17-4b61-a65b-95fb1afff749,"Russia accused Georgia of committing ""genocide"" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a 192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians. Many were able to return to their homes after the war, but a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. As of May 2014, 20,272 persons remained displaced, with their return being blocked by de facto authorities. By 2014, how many Georgians were actually able to return to their homes?","To find out how many Georgians were able to return to their homes by 2014, we need to subtract the number of people who remained displaced in 2014 from the total number of people displaced during the war.

The total number of people displaced during the war was 192,000. This includes both Ossetians and Georgians. 

A year after the war, around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. However, by 2014, this number had decreased to 20,272.

Since we are only given the number of displaced Georgians in the year after the war (30,000) and in 2014 (20,272), we can only calculate the number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes between these two time periods.

The number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes between the year after the war and 2014 is 30,000 - 20,272 = 9,728.

However, to find out the total number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes by 2014, we would need to know the total number of displaced Georgians during the war, which is not provided in the passage.

But since the question asks how many Georgians were actually able to return to their homes by 2014 and we calculated that 9,728 Georgians returned between the year after the war and 2014, and also many were able to return to their homes after the war, we can infer that at least 9,728 Georgians returned, but the actual number is higher.

This means that anything above 60% is considered to be above the poverty line.

Since the question asks for the lowest percentage that is considered to be above the poverty line, we can infer that it is any value above 60%. Therefore, the lowest percentage that is considered to be above the poverty line is the smallest value greater than 60%, which implies that 60% itself is the threshold, and the next integer value is the minimum to be above it.

Number of households: 3,155
Number of housing units: 3,723
Number of families: 2,240

First, let's find the difference between the number of households and families:
3,155 (households) - 2,240 (families) = 915

Next, let's find the difference between the number of housing units and families:
3,723 (housing units) - 2,240 (families) = 1,483

Now, we can add the differences to find the total difference:
915 (households - families) + 1,483 (housing units - families) = 2,398

However, the question asks for the difference between the number of households and housing units combined, and the number of families. To find this, we need to add the number of households and housing units first, then subtract the number of families:
3,155 (households) + 3,723 (housing units) = 6,878
6,878 - 2,240 (families) = 4,638

But since we have two different values (2,398 and 4,638), we should rephrase the question to get the correct answer. If we consider the question as how many more households and housing units were there combined compared to the number of families, the answer would be 4,638. However, if we consider it as how many more households and how many more housing units were there compared to the number of families, the answer would be 915 + 1,483 = 2,398.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble.

Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half.

Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter.

On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4.

Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated. How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?","To find out how many years after wild grains began being harvested the potato was domesticated, we need to subtract the year when wild grains were first harvested from the year when the potato was domesticated.

history_2619_a625695a-d2b9-4b56-a2f6-efecfb49161d,"Northern Europe is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,350-2,900) in Sweden, about 2,200 in Finland, about 700 in Estonia and 70 in Norway, totaling to nearly 5,000 individuals in the wild. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500-3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of Austria until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss. The small group of bears living in the Carinthian-Slovenian Alps is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population. How many more large bears are there in Sweden compared to Finland?","To find the difference in the number of large bears between Sweden and Finland, we need to subtract the estimated number of bears in Finland from the estimated number of bears in Sweden.

The estimated number of bears in Sweden is 2,500 (with a range of 2,350-2,900), and the estimated number of bears in Finland is about 2,200.

Subtracting the number of bears in Finland from the number of bears in Sweden gives us:
2,500 (Sweden) - 2,200 (Finland) = 300

So, there are approximately 300 more large bears in Sweden compared to Finland.

Answer: {300}"
