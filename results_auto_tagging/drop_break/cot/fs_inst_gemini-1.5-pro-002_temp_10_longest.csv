Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss. But the Giants' turnover problem resurfaced in the fourth quarter, where a fumble and an interception ended up costing them any chance at a comeback.

history_1082_dbdf36f7-a935-4b91-9cea-8f2942831ab7,"In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared. At sea a battle broke out near Öland on 11 September, whereafter the war took a pause. How many days passed between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war?","Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the start date:** The Danish fleet fired on the Swedish navy on May 30, 1563.
2. **Identify the end date:** War was officially declared on August 13, 1563.
3. **Calculate the days in each month:**
    * May: 31 - 30 = 1 day remaining in May
    * June: 30 days
    * July: 31 days
    * August: 13 days

At the 1521 Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther banned and the proliferation of his writings prohibited, which in 1529 provoked the Protestation at Speyer by several Lutheran estates.  The tensions culminated to an open conflict over the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, the Apology of which, written by Philipp Melanchthon, was rejected by the Emperor. In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. In 1544 Charles V returned to Germany from the Italian War after he had signed the Treaty of Crépy and began to forge alliances not only with Pope Paul III but also with Lutheran princes, foremost with Duke Maurice of Saxony, the Albertine cousin of Saxon Elector John Frederick I. In view of the Emperor's preparations for battle, the Schmalkaldic leaders on 4 July 1546 gathered at Ichtershausen and agreed that a preventive strike would be advisable, as long as Charles V had not concentrated a significant amount of mercenaries. The Emperor gathered an army of around 52,000 men  for his campaign, that was to start on the Danube.

He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumiñahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.:221-223,226 Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.:235-237 How many years after the uprising in 1536 where many natives were killed did Archaeologists find their remains near Lima?","The passage states that the uprising, where the natives were killed, occurred in 1536.

* November: The entire month of November has 30 days.
* December: From the 1st to the 6th is 6 days.

Adding these together, the treaty negotiations lasted a total of 57 days.

After a scoreless first quarter, Seattle got on the board first with QB Matt Hasselbeck's  29-yard pass to tight end John Carlson.  The Bucs got on the board with Connor Barth's 28-yard field goal to end the first half. In the third quarter, Tampa Bay took the lead after a 45-yard field goal and a 22-yard touchdown pass by QB Josh Freeman to running back Cadillac Williams, set up by a Tanard Jackson interception.  The Buccaneers further extended their lead with a 28-yard pass to running back Derrick Ward, with a successful two-point conversion.  In the fourth quarter, Barth kicked another field goal for 39 yards.  Seattle tried to rally, but Hasselbeck threw an interception (his fourth) in the end zone to cornerback Elbert Mack for a touchback. With the win, the Buccaneers improved to 2-12.  Not only was it their first road win since November 23, 2008, it also marked their first win on the west coast since winning Super Bowl XXXVII in San Diego and their first win in Seattle since 1999. How many yards difference was there between Josh Freeman's field goal and touchdown pass?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Identify the relevant information:** The question asks for the difference in yards between Josh Freeman's field goal and touchdown pass.  The passage states Freeman had a 22-yard touchdown pass. Note that Josh Freeman did *not* kick a field goal; Connor Barth kicked the field goals. The question is asking for the difference between Freeman's touchdown pass (22 yards) and *one* of the field goals.  Since the question doesn't specify which field goal, we can infer that the field goals kicked by Connor Barth (28, 45 and 39 yards) are not directly related to Josh Freeman's actions and thus we should not choose them as the ""field goal"" described in the question.

2. **Recognize the trick:** The question is worded to make you think Freeman is involved with both the touchdown pass and a field goal. This is a tricky aspect of the question. The information about field goals and the name 'Connor Barth' is extra information presented to confuse. We are concerned *only* with the stated length of Freeman's touchdown pass and realizing no field goal length is attributed to him. 

3. **Answer the question:** The question is unanswerable as written due to a factual error. It compares a touchdown pass made by Freeman to a hypothetical field goal also by Freeman, when Freeman did not kick a field goal.

After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army  under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople  the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone.

To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of ""meritoric principles"" and ""blindly graded objective central exams,"" as opposed to ""affirmative action,"" in education. How many points did the black-white IQ gap decrease from 1971-2008?","Here's how to solve this:
* **Find the initial gap:** The passage states the black-white IQ gap was 16.33 points in 1971.
* **Find the later gap:** The gap decreased to 9.94 points by 2008.
* **Calculate the decrease:** Subtract the later gap from the initial gap: 16.33 - 9.94 = 6.39 points.

In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa. How many years were there between the siege of Herceg Novi and Venice taking Vrgorac?","The passage states that the siege of Herceg Novi started on 1 September 1687, and Venice took Vrgorac on 26 November 1690.  Therefore, there are three years between those two events (1687, 1688, 1689, 1690).

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia.

For how many years did Ukraine agree to lease its facilities?","Here's how to break down the lease durations:

* **Initial Lease (1997-2017):** This lease was for 20 years.
* **Extended Lease (2010 agreement - 2042 with option until 2047):**  The extension starts effectively from the end of the initial lease in 2017.  2042 - 2017 = 25 years. With the option, it could be 25 + 5 = 30 years.

The question asks for how many years Ukraine agreed to lease its facilities. This refers to the total duration based on the 2010 agreement, which superseded the original 1997 agreement.  Therefore, the initial 20-year lease is no longer relevant. The answer should be based on the extended lease agreement. The passage explicitly mentions an extension until 2042. While there is an option for 5 more years (until 2047), the question asks for how long Ukraine *agreed* to lease, not the maximum possible lease duration.  Therefore, we only consider the agreed-upon extension until 2042.

history_1459_c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6,"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the population in 1525:** The passage states that Cortés estimated the population of Acalan to be at least 10,000 in 1525.

2. **Find the population in 1553:** The passage states that the population was recorded at around 4,000 in 1553.

3. **Calculate the difference:**  Subtract the 1553 population from the 1525 population: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000.

The largest French ships of the period were the Soleil Royal and the Royal Louis. Each rated for 120 guns, they never carried their full complement. These ships were too large for practical purposes. The former only sailed on one campaign and was destroyed at La Hogue; the latter languished in port until sold in 1694. By the 1680s, French ship-design was at least equal to its English and Dutch counterparts, and by the Nine Years' War the French fleet had surpassed ships of the Royal Navy, whose designs stagnated in the 1690s.

In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March. By this time Cardinal Richelieu remarked: How many more men larger was the army that began operations against Genoa than the reinforcements from Spain that were captured?","The passage states that a 30,000-strong army began operations against Genoa. It also states that 4,000 Spanish reinforcements were intercepted.  30,000 - 4,000 = 26,000.

history_1313_797e963c-52f2-4f8e-ba70-5a382cda0d85,"Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century?","Here's how to find the answer: The passage mentions two revolutions: the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the February Revolution of 1917.

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly ""Redshanks"" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under Richard Hamilton routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down  on 14 March 1689 and occupied eastern Ulster. How many months after the Siege of Derry did the encounter at Dromore County Down take place?","The passage states that the Siege of Derry began on December 7, 1688. The encounter at Dromore, County Down took place on March 14, 1689.  From December 7, 1688 to March 14, 1689 is a little over three months.  Specifically, there are 9 days remaining in December, then 31 days in January, 28 days in February (1689 was not a leap year), and 14 days in March. This adds up to 9 + 31 + 28 + 14 = 82 days. 82 days is approximately 2.7 months (82/30 ≈ 2.73). So, the encounter at Dromore took place roughly three months after the Siege of Derry began.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage. How many years passed from the inheritance treat to when the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus?","The inheritance treaty between Silesian duke Frederick II and Brandenburg's Joachim II Hector was signed in 1537.

1. **Haggan's Interception Return TD:** This is a defensive play, so it doesn't count towards offensive yardage.

2. **Tebow to Thomas TD (21 yards):** This is the first offensive response, for 21 yards.

3. **Tebow to Thomas TD (41 yards):** This is the second offensive response, for 41 yards.

4. **McGahee's Rushing TD (24 yards):** This is the third offensive response, for 24 yards.  The two-point conversion that follows is not included, as the question specifically asks for yards.

5. **Prater's Field Goal (46 yards):** While this results in points, field goal yardage isn't considered in the same way as passing or rushing yards when calculating offensive responses.

6. **Goodman's Interception Return:** Similar to Haggan's interception, this is a defensive play and doesn't contribute to offensive yardage.  The subsequent field goal also doesn't count.

Therefore, the Broncos responded with 21 + 41 + 24 = 86 yards.

Alem and the death of Aristóbulo del Valle. In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist. The dissolution of the Radical Civic Union resulted in the formation of a core of radical elements that recognized as their leader Hipólito Yrigoyen. Onto this core - composed of young men, recruited from the middle class, professionals, businessmen, employees, ranchers of the old federal tradition, settlers and laborers from the countryside - was Yrigoyen able to impose discipline and enthusiasm. In this context, in 1903 Hipólito Yrigoyen began his revival and reorganization. On February 29 of 1904, after 7 years of inactivity, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union said the electoral abstention of all the radicals of the Republic in the elections of representatives from the nation, senators from the capital, electors for president and vice president of the nation, and announced an armed resistance.

Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich.

In parallel to the mediation, Prince Edward and King Hugh began negotiating a truce with Sultan Baibars; a 10-year-10-month-and-10-day agreement was reached in May 1272, at Caesarea.

1. **He arrives in Sicily in September 1272.**  The passage says he departs Acre for Sicily in this month.
2. **He leaves Sicily in 1273.**  The passage states, ""In 1273 Edward started his homeward journey via Italy..."" meaning he left Sicily sometime during that year.

Since he arrived in September 1272 and left sometime in 1273, he spent a maximum of approximately 9-10 months in Sicily (September to December of 1272 which is at least 3 months, followed by potentially part or all of 1273).  However, the question asks for the number of *years*.  He was there for part of one year and part of the next, which counts approximately around one year, not two.

In 1665-66 they built a seminary in Ayutthaya with the approval of King Narai, the Seminary of Saint Joseph . In 1669, Louis Laneau, Bishop of Motella, also a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, was named head of a Roman Catholic mission in mainland Southeast Asia, with his headquarters at Ayutthaya. They propagated the Christian faith and also took care of Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Thailand. Narai welcomed these missionaries, providing them with land for a church, a mission-house and a seminary .Bishops Lambert and Ballue established a Western hospital in Thailand in 1669 at Ayutthaya, with Father Laneau as the head doctor. The hospital provided medical care to about 200-300 people daily. During a 1670 trip to France, Pallu obtained from Louis XIV a letter to King Narai, which, together with a letter from the Pope, he remitted in Ayutthaya in October 1673 and which was received with great reverence. These contacts were closely associated with the development of French influence in South Asia, and especially with the establishment of the French East India Company in 1664, and the development of colonial French India. How many years did it take after arriving for the seminary to be built in Ayutthaya?","The passage states that the missionaries arrived in Ayutthaya in 1664 and built the seminary in 1665-1666.  This means it took one to two years. Since the question asks how many years it took *after* arriving, we can be sure it took at least one year and at most two years. The prompt doesn't ask for a range but an exact number of years. It is reasonable to assume that ""1665-1666"" means it was completed in 1666. Therefore 1666 - 1664 = 2 years.

The average household size was 2.20 and the average family size was 2.90. How many more households had a female householder with no husband present compared to a  male householder with no wife present?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the number of households with a female householder:** 1882 households * 9.7% = 182.654 households. Since we're dealing with whole households, we can round this to 183.

2. **Find the number of households with a male householder:** 1882 households * 3.6% = 67.752 households. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 68.

3. **Find the difference:** 183 households - 68 households = 115 households.

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma.

history_1782_0dec7ec5-e8eb-46fe-9756-fc132750ca60,"One week later, Dallas faced the 1993 San Francisco 49ers season in the NFC Championship Game for the second year in a row in what was, at the time, the last NFL game to air on CBS.  The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.  But this time, the game was extremely one-sided.  The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions.  By the end of the half, Dallas had a commanding 28-7 lead.  Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.  Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback.  However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper.  Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in ""garbage time"" to make the final score 38-21.  Smith rushed for 88 yards, caught seven passes for 85 yards, and scored two touchdowns.  Meanwhile, the Dallas defense held 49ers running back Ricky Watters, who rushed for over 100 yards and scored 5 touchdowns in the divisional round, to just 37 yards on 12 carries.

The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.  But this time, the game was extremely one-sided.  The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions.  By the end of the half, Dallas had a commanding 28-7 lead.  Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.  Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback.  However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper.  Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in ""garbage time"" to make the final score 38-21.  Smith rushed for 88 yards, caught seven passes for 85 yards, and scored two touchdowns.

How many passes did Aikman not complete in the first half?","Here's how to find the answer:

1. **Find Aikman's total passes in the first half:** The passage states Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes *in the entire game*. It doesn't specify how many were in the first half.

2. **Determine incomplete passes:** Since we only know his total passes and completions for the *whole game*, we can only calculate his incomplete passes for the *whole game*.  He threw 18 passes and completed 14, meaning he had 18 - 14 = 4 incomplete passes in the whole game.

3. **Insufficient information:** The passage *doesn't provide enough information* to determine how many passes Aikman didn't complete in the *first half* specifically.

1. **Identify the key events:** Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat was in April 1695. President Barrios began planning another expedition after this retreat, in the second half of 1695. Barrios died in November 1695.

2. **Determine the timeframe:** The question asks for the number of months between the criticism of the retreat (which prompted the planning of the next expedition) and Barrios' death.  The passage states the planning began in the second half of 1695, meaning after June. We can assume the criticism and subsequent planning occurred shortly after the retreat in April. Barrios then died in November.

3. **Calculate the difference:** From roughly April/May to November, there are approximately 6-7 months. Since the question asks ""how many months *after* the criticism,"" and the criticism happened in the second half of the year after the April retreat, the death in November would fall within that timeframe.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.

The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands. Njdeh again proved himself as a long-sighted politician, he did not depart from Syunik and continued his struggle against the Red Army and Soviet Azerbaijan. How many days after the Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started did the actual transfer of power take place in Yerevan?","The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion started on November 29th, 1920. The transfer of power occurred on December 2nd, 1920.  To find the difference in days, we simply subtract the starting date from the ending date: December 2nd - November 29th.  Since November has 30 days, there are 30 - 29 = 1 day remaining in November after the invasion. Then add the 2 days in December. 1 + 2 = 3 days.

In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new ""Academic Library"" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes.

In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries. How many more volumes per year does the Main Library deal with compared to the growth of the Academic LIbrary 100 years prior?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Identify the current growth of the Main Library:** The passage states the Main Library has an annual growth of 40,000 volumes.

2. **Identify the past growth of the Academic Library:** The passage mentions the annual growth of the library (before it became the Main Library on the Ring) was up to 30,000 volumes.

Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead. Neil Rackers set up for a kick with less than 15&#160;seconds to play in order to send the 23-20 contest into overtime.  Rackers missed the uprights by a foot with seconds left in the game. How many quarters did Dante Hall play in?","The passage states that Dante Hall was injured on the opening kickoff and left the game.  The opening kickoff happens at the beginning of the first quarter.  This means he likely didn't play a full quarter.

history_1306_cf084a28-2e17-4b61-a65b-95fb1afff749,"Russia accused Georgia of committing ""genocide"" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a 192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians. Many were able to return to their homes after the war, but a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. As of May 2014, 20,272 persons remained displaced, with their return being blocked by de facto authorities. By 2014, how many Georgians were actually able to return to their homes?","The passage states that 192,000 people were displaced, and 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced a year later.  Then, it says 20,272 persons remained displaced by 2014.  The question asks how many were able to return by 2014.  We know 30,000 - 20,272 = 9,728 returned between the one year mark and 2014. Since the question asks how many Georgians returned, and we only know the number of ethnic Georgians *still* displaced after a year, we need to subtract those still displaced in 2014 (20,272) from the original number of displaced persons (192,000) to find the total number of people who returned, regardless of ethnicity:  192,000 - 20,272 = 171,728. This represents the total number of people who returned to their homes by 2014, including ethnic Georgians.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line.

Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half.

The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21.

Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter.

On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter.

The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots career. How many more yards did the Patriots have in 1979 than this game?","Here's how to find the solution:

1. **Find the Patriots' yardage in the described game:** The passage states the Patriots had 530 net yards of offense in this game.

2. **Find the Patriots' yardage in 1979:** The passage mentions the Patriots had 597 yards in 1979.

3. **Calculate the difference:** Subtract the yardage from the current game (530) from the yardage in 1979 (597). 597 - 530 = 67

The passage provides the percentage of the population for each age group, along with the actual number of people in each group. To find the total population, we can use any of these age groups.  Let's take the 0-9 age group: 11,818 children represent 9.4% of the population.

Let 'x' be the total population.
9.4% of x = 11,818
(9.4/100) * x = 11,818
x = 11,818 * (100/9.4)
x = 125,723.4

Since population must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

history_2361_6406a4e8-2ee7-4d56-b479-d5e8f1a6c96c,"The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunter-gatherer. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated. How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Find the timeframe for potato domestication:** The passage says potatoes were domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago. The earliest point in this range is 10,000 years ago.

2. **Find when wild grains were first harvested:** The passage says wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.

Exacerbated by the economic embargo imposed during the Bosnian war, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) economys downward spiral showed no real sign of recovery until 1995. Gross domestic product was nowhere near its 1991 level, but the Kosovo War of the basic infrastructure of the country and many factories, as well as a renewed embargo caused a further huge drop in GDP in relation to the 1991 level. The first sign of an economic recovery occurred in 2001 after the removal of Milošević on 5 October 2000.

However, the passage also states that ""In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise Tower block construction occurred"".  This implies some of the high-rises included in the ""more than 30"" may have been built in the very early 2000s. Since the question asks about the number built *before* 2000, and since more than 30 were built since 2000,  the number must be less than 42.  Since we can't determine exactly how many of the ""more than 30"" were built between 2000 and 2002, the exact number isn't something we can compute from the passage.  We just know it must be fewer than 42.  But since the question asks ""How many *of* the 72 high rises in Houston were built before the year 2000?"" and not *exactly* how many,  we'll use the information given about the 30 built since 2000, to calculate the upper bound, namely 42.

history_2650_b06d3130-f65d-4da9-b87e-a20a62dd8191,"The U.S. Marine Corps issued a request for proposals (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers. By 2017, the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of 3,500 A2 series Humvees, 9,500 ECV Humvees, and 5,000 JLTVs, with 18,000 vehicles in total. Humvees in service with the Marine Corps will be upgraded through 2030. The Marines shelved the Humvee modernization effort in March 2015 due to budget cuts.
