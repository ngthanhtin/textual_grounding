nfl_1981_c32b9ccf-b3ec-44d5-b8b2-2bda74abf00b," A power outage that disrupted play in the third quarter served as a fitting metaphor for the Giants' general lack of power on the field this night. Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss. But the Giants' turnover problem resurfaced in the fourth quarter, where a fumble and an interception ended up costing them any chance at a comeback. How many quarters did Smith play?","The passage states that Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered *during practice*.  This means he did not play in the game at all.

At first, the Qianlong Emperor envisaged an easy war, and sent in only the Green Standard troops stationed in Yunnan. The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in their latest invasion of Siam. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765-1766 and 1766-1767 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military manoeuvres nationwide in both countries. The third invasion  led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days' march from Ava. But the Bannermen of northern China could not cope with unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases, and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close-call, Hsinbyushin redeployed his armies from Siam to the Chinese front. The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier.

At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared. At sea a battle broke out near Öland on 11 September, whereafter the war took a pause. How many days passed between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war?","The Danish fleet fired on the Swedish navy on May 30, 1563. War was declared on August 13, 1563.

To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the number of days in June, July, and the first 13 days of August.

* June has 30 days.
* July has 31 days.
* August has 13 days (until the 13th).

Total days = 30 + 31 + 13 = 74 days

Therefore, 74 days passed between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war.

At the 1521 Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther banned and the proliferation of his writings prohibited, which in 1529 provoked the Protestation at Speyer by several Lutheran estates.  The tensions culminated to an open conflict over the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, the Apology of which, written by Philipp Melanchthon, was rejected by the Emperor. In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. In 1544 Charles V returned to Germany from the Italian War after he had signed the Treaty of Crépy and began to forge alliances not only with Pope Paul III but also with Lutheran princes, foremost with Duke Maurice of Saxony, the Albertine cousin of Saxon Elector John Frederick I. In view of the Emperor's preparations for battle, the Schmalkaldic leaders on 4 July 1546 gathered at Ichtershausen and agreed that a preventive strike would be advisable, as long as Charles V had not concentrated a significant amount of mercenaries. The Emperor gathered an army of around 52,000 men  for his campaign, that was to start on the Danube. How many years after the Protestation at Speyer did the Lutheran Augsburg Confession take place?","The passage states that the Protestation at Speyer occurred in 1529 and the Lutheran Augsburg Confession took place in 1530.  Therefore, the Augsburg Confession took place 1530 - 1529 = 1 year after the Protestation at Speyer.

He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumiñahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.:221-223,226 Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007.

Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled.

After a scoreless first quarter, Seattle got on the board first with QB Matt Hasselbeck's  29-yard pass to tight end John Carlson.  The Bucs got on the board with Connor Barth's 28-yard field goal to end the first half. In the third quarter, Tampa Bay took the lead after a 45-yard field goal and a 22-yard touchdown pass by QB Josh Freeman to running back Cadillac Williams, set up by a Tanard Jackson interception.  The Buccaneers further extended their lead with a 28-yard pass to running back Derrick Ward, with a successful two-point conversion.  In the fourth quarter, Barth kicked another field goal for 39 yards.  Seattle tried to rally, but Hasselbeck threw an interception (his fourth) in the end zone to cornerback Elbert Mack for a touchback. With the win, the Buccaneers improved to 2-12.  Not only was it their first road win since November 23, 2008, it also marked their first win on the west coast since winning Super Bowl XXXVII in San Diego and their first win in Seattle since 1999. How many yards difference was there between Josh Freeman's field goal and touchdown pass?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find Josh Freeman's touchdown pass length:** The passage states Josh Freeman threw a 22-yard touchdown pass.

2. **Find Josh Freeman's field goal length:**  The passage mentions a 45-yard field goal by Tampa Bay in the third quarter, but it doesn't explicitly state that this was kicked by Josh Freeman.  The question asks about the difference between Josh Freeman's field goal and touchdown pass.  The passage only describes one field goal kicked by Josh Freeman, and that is not mentioned. The information provided says that the 45-yard field goal contributed to Tampa Bay taking the lead, but this doesn't necessarily mean it was kicked by Josh Freeman. Therefore, we cannot use the 45 yard field goal to answer this question.

3. **Calculate the difference:** Since we cannot determine the length of a field goal kicked by Josh Freeman, we cannot calculate the difference.  The question is unanswerable based on the provided text.

The passage states that 55% of Americans worked in services in 1955 and over 65% worked in services in 1980.  To find the difference, subtract the 1955 percentage from the 1980 percentage.  However, we only have a range for 1980 (over 65%). We will use 65% as a lower bound to find the minimum difference.

65% (1980) - 55% (1955) = 10%

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia.

Şahin Bey entered Serbia with 20.000 akinjis at that time he learned that Serbian lords had prepared an army to attack his troops. He advanced to Pločnik near Prokuplje but could not detect the position of that army, and believed that there was none. At that time, many akinjis  lost their temper and began looting civilian properties in the surrounding villages by disobeying orders. Şahin Bey stayed alone with 2,000 soldiers. On the other hand, the battlefield was observed by Serbian expeditionary forces. Suddenly an allied army with 30,000 soldiers appeared, many of whom were cavalry. The Serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charge with horse archers on the flanks. The Serbs first attacked the Ottoman center , although they were unprepared and tasted nasty shock to heavy Serbian knights, the outnumbered Ottoman center resisted for some time but later began to withdraw with Şahin Bey who barely escaped with his life. Then the Serbian army turned to the other 18,000 akinjis that were busy plundering; unprepared, ill-disciplined, surprised akinjis couldn't do anything without their general. Only 5,000 of them returned home alive. More than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. According to tradition Serbian knight and folk hero Miloš Obilić participated in this battle and distinguished himself, and was wounded by an Ottoman arrow. According to some, such as Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klaić, Lazar's army was aided by Bosnian troops. One version of the battle has it that the battle was won thanks to the Bosnian troops and the trickery of a Kastrioti. How many of the akinjis died?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Start with the total number of akinjis:** Şahin Bey began with 20,000 akinjis.

2. **Find the number of akinjis that survived:** 5,000 akinjis returned home alive.

3. **Calculate the number of akinjis who died:** Subtract the survivors from the initial number: 20,000 - 5,000 = 15,000

Answer: {15000}

history_1459_c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6,"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?","The passage states that in 1525, Hernán Cortés estimated the population of Acalan to be at least 10,000.  In 1553, the population was recorded at around 4,000.  To find the difference, subtract the 1553 population from the 1525 population: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000.

The largest French ships of the period were the Soleil Royal and the Royal Louis. Each rated for 120 guns, they never carried their full complement. These ships were too large for practical purposes.

In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March. By this time Cardinal Richelieu remarked: How many more men larger was the army that began operations against Genoa than the reinforcements from Spain that were captured?","The passage states that the army that began operations against Genoa was 30,000 strong.  The Spanish reinforcements intercepted were 4,000.  The difference is 30,000 - 4,000 = 26,000.  Therefore, the army was 26,000 men larger.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.

The question asks how many *more* males there were than females.  This implies a subtraction. However, the question is phrased in a confusing way. It asks how many *more females* there were than males. Since there are more males than females, the number of ""more females"" is negative.  To find the difference, we subtract the number of females from the number of males:

173.2 males - 100 females = 73.2 more males

history_1650_2a7434bc-8b5e-4670-8ab4-e2068d5eb24b,"After William's landing in England, James' Lord Deputy in Ireland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell took action to ensure that all strong points in Ireland were held by garrisons of the newly recruited Irish Catholic army, loyal to James. The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly ""Redshanks"" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained. Nevertheless, a Jacobite force under Richard Hamilton routed a Protestant Williamite militia in an encounter at Dromore, County Down  on 14 March 1689 and occupied eastern Ulster. How many months after the Siege of Derry did the encounter at Dromore County Down take place?","The Siege of Derry began on December 7, 1688. The encounter at Dromore took place on March 14, 1689.

To find the number of months between these dates, we can calculate the difference:

* December 1688 has 31 days.  Days remaining in December: 31 - 7 = 24 days
* January 1689 has 31 days
* February 1689 has 28 days (1689 was not a leap year)
* March 1689 has 14 days

Total number of days: 24 + 31 + 28 + 14 = 97 days

To convert this to months, we can approximate.  There are roughly 30 days in a month, so 97 days is approximately 97/30 ≈ 3.2 months.  Since we are asked for the number of months, and it's a little over 3 months, we should round to the nearest whole number.

The line, drawn about 5 km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition. Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35 km . The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km  wide front moving 20-30 km  deeper into the Lithuanian territory. On July 18, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. It was approved by the Entente on July 26. The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3. Two major modifications favorable to the Poles were made: the Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km  west. Again, both Poles and Lithuanians protested the line as it would require them to withdraw their armies from the Vilnius and Suwałki Regions respectively.

history_1578_d3bc4a55-84c8-4379-a2df-610e30794d1a,"Baldwin de Burg was a nephew of Baldwin I of Jerusalem and the Count of Edessa from 1100 to 1118. In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Pope Callixtus II sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem. The Venetians abandoned the siege of Corfu when they heard this news, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123.

history_1578_b4230db9-a914-4172-9489-c0f6ea85d583,"Baldwin de Burg was a nephew of Baldwin I of Jerusalem and the Count of Edessa from 1100 to 1118. In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Pope Callixtus II sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem. The Venetians abandoned the siege of Corfu when they heard this news, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123. How many years after becoming king did Baldwin get captured by Balak of Mardin?","Explanation:
Baldwin II became king in 1118. He was captured by Balak of Mardin in 1123.  The difference between these years is 1123 - 1118 = 5 years.

It only details the yardage of specific completed passes:

* 19-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph
* 52-yard touchdown pass to Percy Harvin
* 48-yard touchdown pass to Percy Harvin

To find the total yardage from these passes, we add them together: 19 + 52 + 48 = 119 yards.  The question asks how many yards Ponder got, and while we only have data for these three completed passes,  we cannot account for incomplete passes or other yardage gained (or lost) during the game. Therefore, we can only calculate the yardage from the three explicitly mentioned touchdown passes.

Jeff Reed nailed a field goal before the half to draw the Steelers within 10, and hit another in the third to bring them within a touchdown. However, a scoreless fourth by both teams led the Browns to their first win against the Steelers since 2003, and the Browns became only the fourth team in NFL history to be at least 10 games under .500 and defeat the defending Super Bowl champions. With the win, the Browns improved to 2-11, snapped a twelve-game losing streak against the Steelers and won against them for the first time since 2003 when they defeated the team 33-13 in Pittsburgh.  The team also won their first home game since an October 2008 victory, interestingly against then-defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants. KR Josh Cribbs was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. How many points did the Steelers score in the first half?","The passage states that Jeff Reed (Steelers kicker) hit a field goal before halftime, drawing the Steelers within 10 points of the Browns' 13-point lead.  Field goals are worth 3 points. Therefore, the Steelers scored 3 points in the first half.

Alem and the death of Aristóbulo del Valle. In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist. The dissolution of the Radical Civic Union resulted in the formation of a core of radical elements that recognized as their leader Hipólito Yrigoyen. Onto this core - composed of young men, recruited from the middle class, professionals, businessmen, employees, ranchers of the old federal tradition, settlers and laborers from the countryside - was Yrigoyen able to impose discipline and enthusiasm. In this context, in 1903 Hipólito Yrigoyen began his revival and reorganization. On February 29 of 1904, after 7 years of inactivity, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union said the electoral abstention of all the radicals of the Republic in the elections of representatives from the nation, senators from the capital, electors for president and vice president of the nation, and announced an armed resistance.

history_1002_d8ee2dcc-91d9-4e9b-914c-f1dbd2b504e0,"After the fall of Pegu in December 1599, Lower Burma was in utter chaos, and politically fragmented among Toungoo, Prome, Arakanese/Portuguese Syriam and Siamese Martaban. In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma. In early 1606, his 7,000-strong forces took Theinni, Thibaw and Momeik but the king died during the campaign on 3 March 1606. How many years after Pegu fell did the king die?","The passage states that Pegu fell in December 1599 and the king died on March 3, 1606.  To find the difference, we calculate the number of years between 1599 and 1606.  1606 - 1599 = 7 years.  However, since the fall of Pegu was in December and the king died in March, the number of years is approximately 6. Since we are asked how many years after Pegu fell the king died, we will use the more precise calculation: 6 years and approximately 3 months. For simplicity, we will round to the nearest year.

In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side.

Members of the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s and were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in the 1960s and 1970s, were once the largest shareholder of the club. In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to financial difficulties for the club. In November 1982, Irving Scholar bought 25% of the club for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club. Scholar Flotation (shares) Tottenham Hotspur Public limited company, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market. The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. Ill-judged financial decisions led to accumulating debts, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute.  By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC Group. For how many years did Alan Sugar own the majority of the club?","Alan Sugar gained majority control of Tottenham Hotspur in December 1991. He sold the majority of his shares in February 2001.  The number of years he held majority control is 2001 - 1991 = 10 years. However,  the question asks for the number of years he owned the *majority* of the club.  While he increased his stake to become the dominant partner in December 1991, the passage states that he began to consider selling in 2000. This implies that he held majority ownership for approximately 9 years (late 1991 to early 2001). To be precise, it was almost 9 years and 2 months.  But since we only have year information, and it asks for the number of years, we round down.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán leaving sick soldiers behind?","Amésqueta arrived at Mopán on February 25th, 1696.  Díaz de Velasco's party set out from Mopán on March 7th, 1696.  The number of days between these two dates is calculated as follows:

From February 25th to March 1st is 6 days.
From March 1st to March 7th is 6 days.

Therefore, they set out 12 days after Amésqueta arrived at Mopán.  They left the sick soldiers behind after 5 days of travel.  The question asks how many days after Amésqueta's arrival at Mopán that they left the sick soldiers.  However,  the passage does not state that the departure of the sick soldiers happened on the same day as the Mopán departure; it simply states they left them behind *after* five days of travel.  Therefore, the direct answer to the question is 12.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.

history_2001_b1190d11-f7bf-43e0-addf-7cc9d3f3e8cc,"Several 16th century writers estimated the 1492 population of Hispaniola at over 1 million people. 20th century estimates of the figure range from 60,000 to 8,000,000, but center around the 500,000 to 1,000,000 range. Harsh enslavement by Spanish colonists, as well as redirection of food supplies and labor towards the colonists, had a devastating impact on both mortality and fertility over the first quarter century. Colonial administrators and Dominican and Hyeronimite priests observed that the search for gold and agrarian enslavement through the encomienda system were depressing population. Demographic data from two provinces in 1514 shows a low birth rate consistent with a 3.5% annual population decline. Just 14,000 Taínos survived in 1517. In 1503 the colony began to import Ethnic groups of Africa slaves after a charter was passed in 1501 allowing the import of slaves by Ferdinand and Isabel. The Spanish believed Africans would be more capable of performing physical labor. From 1519 to 1533, the indigenous uprising known as Enriquillos Revolt ensued, resulting from escaped African slaves on the island possibly working with the Taino people.

Therefore, considering the conflict as one continuous event, it lasted for two years (1919-1920) or three years (1919-1921) depending on the interpretation of the ending date.  However, to be consistent with the continuous nature of the war as described, the most accurate answer is two years if considering it as one continuous conflict.  But if strictly following the signing of the treaty, it lasted three years.  Since the question asks for a single number, we will go with the more common and commonly understood duration which is two years (if considered a continuous war) but it could also be three depending on which date is used.

During the Bombing of Cologne in World War II, Cologne endured 262 air raids by the Western Allies of World War II, which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of ""Operation Millennium"", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the Royal Air Force in World War II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary. This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed  of built-up area (61%),  killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. The devastation was recorded by Hermann Claasen from 1942 until the end of the war, and presented in his exhibition and book of 1947 Singing in the furnace. Cologne - Remains of an old city How many tons of bombs and explosives were dropped on Cologne during the 261 air raids that did not happen during ""Operation Millennium?""","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Total tonnage from all raids:** The passage states that 44,923.2 tons of bombs were dropped on Cologne during WWII.

2. **Tonnage from Operation Millennium:** Operation Millennium involved 1,455 tons of explosives.

3. **Tonnage from other raids:** Subtract the tonnage from Operation Millennium from the total tonnage: 44,923.2 tons - 1,455 tons = 43,468.2 tons

Therefore, 43,468.2 tons of bombs and explosives were dropped on Cologne during the 261 air raids that did not include Operation Millennium.

* 23 were executed

In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new ""Academic Library"" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library.

In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public.

Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead.

Jerôme Maurand, a priest of Antibes who accompanied Polin and the Ottoman fleet in 1544, wrote a detailed account in Itinéraire d'Antibes à Constantinople. They arrived in Constantinople on 10 August 1544 to meet with Suleiman and give him an account of the campaign. Polin was back to Toulon on 2 October 1544. On his way to Constantinople, how many cities did Polin laid waste to?","The passage states that Barbarossa, accompanied by Polin's fleet, laid waste to Porto Ercole, Giglio, Talamona, and Lipari.  The passage does not state that Polin himself laid waste to these cities, only that he was present as part of the fleet.  Therefore, the number of cities Polin laid waste to is not explicitly stated.  However, it can be inferred that Polin participated in the attacks.

history_1306_cf084a28-2e17-4b61-a65b-95fb1afff749,"Russia accused Georgia of committing ""genocide"" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a 192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians. Many were able to return to their homes after the war, but a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. As of May 2014, 20,272 persons remained displaced, with their return being blocked by de facto authorities. By 2014, how many Georgians were actually able to return to their homes?","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find the initial number of displaced Georgians:** The passage states that 192,000 people were displaced, including both Ossetians and Georgians.  A year later, 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced.

2. **Calculate the number of Georgians who returned:** Subtract the number of Georgians still displaced from the initial number of displaced people (this assumes all initially displaced Georgians are included in the total displacement figure of 192000).  This gives us an approximation of the number of Georgians who returned: 30,000 (still displaced) - 192,000 (total displaced) = 162,000

The question asks for how many were able to return, but we are only given the numbers of displaced Georgians one year after the war.  The passage does not give the initial number of displaced Georgians, therefore, only the number of Georgians still displaced one year after the war is known. We cannot precisely calculate the number of Georgians who returned to their homes.  We only know that at least 162,000 returned, but this is a lower bound due to the ambiguity in the initial number of displaced Georgians.

Answer: {At least 162,000}

history_1814_5bc8b6b1-4f81-49ef-97f3-df0b7800df67,"The first two Buick automobiles were made in 1899 and 1900 at the ""Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company"" by chief-engineer Walter Lorenzo Marr, but company owner David Dunbar Buick was reluctant to begin making automobiles, being satisfied with stationary and marine engine production, so Marr left Buick in 1901 to found Marr (automobile) under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marrs valve-in-head (Overhead valve engine) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in 1904. In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called ""Buick Motor Company,"" moved to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind. Marr was rehired in Flint as chief engineer, to begin making automobiles in production. That year, 37 Buick automobiles were made, production increasing to 750 in 1905, 1,400 in 1906, 4,641 in 1907, and 8,800 in 1908, taking the number one spot away from close competitors Oldsmobile, Ford Motor Company, and Maxwell automobile.

The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone.

Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter.

On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead.

How many people live in Lausanne?","Here's how to solve this problem:

The passage provides the percentage of the Lausanne population within each age group and the number of people in each group.  To find the total population, we can use the fact that the percentages add up to 100%. However, a simpler approach is to take any age group's population and divide it by its percentage (expressed as a decimal).  This will give us the total population.

Let's use the 0-9 age group as an example:

* There are 11,818 people in the 0-9 age group.
* This group represents 9.4% or 0.094 of the total population.

Therefore, the total population is: 11,818 / 0.094 

Let's calculate that:

11,818 / 0.094 ≈ 125702.1

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round to the nearest whole number.  We can verify this by doing the same calculation for other groups.  Slight discrepancies might arise due to rounding in the provided percentages.

history_2361_6406a4e8-2ee7-4d56-b479-d5e8f1a6c96c,"The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunter-gatherer. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated. How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Find the earliest date of wild grain harvesting:** The passage states wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.

2. **Find the earliest date of potato domestication:** The passage says the potato was domesticated in the Andes between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago.  We'll use the earliest date, 10,000 years ago, for this calculation.

3. **Calculate the difference:** Subtract the earliest potato domestication date from the earliest wild grain harvesting date: 105,000 years - 10,000 years = 95,000 years.

This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersapproximately 10% of the Soviet Unions adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Unions 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many members did the party lose 1933 to 1939?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the membership in 1933:** The passage states that party membership grew to approximately 3.5 million in 1933.

2. **Find the membership in 1939:**  The passage gives two figures for 1939 membership: 1.9 million (excluding candidate members) and 2.307 million (including candidate members).  Since the question doesn't specify whether to include candidate members, we'll use the lower figure for a more conservative estimate.

3. **Calculate the difference:** Subtract the 1939 membership from the 1933 membership: 3.5 million - 1.9 million = 1.6 million

Therefore, the party lost approximately 1.6 million members between 1933 and 1939.

Answer: {1.6 million}

The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers.
