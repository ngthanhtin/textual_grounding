The total number of members in May 2016 was 16,019, and the number of active military personnel was 14,506. 

16,019 - 14,506 = 1,513

However, this includes 1,513 civil servants, but we also need to consider the 6,000 reserves mentioned in the passage. Since the 6,000 reserves are not included in the 16,019 members mentioned in May 2016, we can assume that the 1,513 non-active military personnel mentioned in May 2016 are the civil servants. 

But to answer the question, we need to consider the total number of non-active military personnel, including the reserves. 

The total number of non-active military personnel is the sum of the civil servants and the reserves. 

1,513 (civil servants) + 6,000 (reserves) is not correct, because the 6,000 reserves are not part of the 16,019 members in May 2016.

However, to answer the question, we need to consider the total number of non-active military personnel, including the reserves. 

The total number of non-active military personnel is the sum of the civil servants and the reserves, but the 6,000 reserves are not part of the 16,019 members in May 2016.

We can only use the data given for May 2016, which is 1,513.

How many people, in terms of percentage, were not solely White or solely African American?","To find the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American, we need to subtract the percentages of White and African American from 100%.

According to the passage, 97.90% were White and 0.56% were African American. 

First, add the percentages of White and African American: 97.90% + 0.56% = 98.46%

Then, subtract this sum from 100%: 100% - 98.46% = 1.54%

However, this calculation does not take into account the people who identified as two or more races. Since 0.74% identified as two or more races, we should add this percentage to the result.

1.54% + 0.74% = 2.28%

So, the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is 2.28% + the percentage of people who identified as other racial groups (0.15% Native American, 0.28% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.36% from other racial groups). 

Adding these percentages to 2.28%: 2.28% + 0.15% + 0.28% + 0.02% + 0.36% = 3.09%

However, this still does not account for the people who identified as Hispanic or Latino, which can be of any race. Since 0.93% identified as Hispanic or Latino, we should add this percentage to the result.

3.09% + 0.93% = 4.02%

Therefore, the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is at least 4.02% + the percentage of people who identified as two or more races that include White or African American. However, this information is not provided in the passage.

Considering only the information provided in the passage, the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is at least 4.02% + the percentage of people who identified as two or more races that include White or African American, but this information is not available.

According to the passage, there were 23,475 Roma people in Skopje. To find the total number of people who weren't Roma, we need to subtract the number of Roma people from the total population. However, the total population is not directly given in the passage. 

We can calculate the total population by adding the number of people in each ethnic group and the number of people who didn't belong to any of these groups. 
338,358 (Macedonians) + 103,891 (Albanians) + 23,475 (Roma) + 14,298 (Serbs) + 8,595 (Turks) + 7,585 (Bosniaks) + 2,557 (Vlachs) + 8,167 (people who didn't belong to any of these groups) = 506,982.

Now, we can find the total number of people who weren't Roma by subtracting the number of Roma people from the total population.
506,982 - 23,475 = 483,507.

To find the percentage of people who weren't Roma, we can divide the number of people who weren't Roma by the total population and multiply by 100.

According to the passage, the Battle of Nieuwpoort occurred in 1600, and the area obtained city rights in 1163.

However, it seems that the passage actually contains an error in the chronology, as the Battle of Nieuwpoort occurred in 1600, and the area obtained city rights in 1163, which is more than 400 years before the Battle of Nieuwpoort.

Given the information in the passage, it seems that the area actually obtained city rights more than 400 years before the Battle of Nieuwpoort, rather than after.

history_1082_dbdf36f7-a935-4b91-9cea-8f2942831ab7,"In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked Älvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, Älvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared. At sea a battle broke out near Öland on 11 September, whereafter the war took a pause. How many days passed between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war?","To find the number of days between the Danish fleet firing on the Swedish navy and the declaration of war, we need to calculate the difference between the dates 30 May 1563 and 13 August 1563.

First, we calculate the number of days in May and June that passed after the incident: 31 May - 30 May = 1 day in May, and the entire month of June has 30 days. 
Then, we add the days in July and the days in August until the declaration of war: 31 days in July and 13 days in August. 

So, the total number of days is: 1 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 13 (August) = 75.

The entire island of Ireland became the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. 

To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the number of days in the remaining part of 1921 after 6 December, add the number of days in 1922, and then subtract 1 day since the event occurred on the same date (6 December) in the next year.

So, the total number of days is 25 + 365 = 390.

However, since the event occurred on the same date (6 December) in the next year, we should subtract 1 day from the total number of days in a year (365) that have passed and add the 25 days from the remaining part of 1921.

The Giants scored first, sending Jacobs in for a 4-yard touchdown run following a Terrell Thomas interception. Later, Arizona running back Beanie Wells scored his first career touchdown on a 13-yard rush. Manning responded by throwing a 62-yard touchdown to Nicks for his longest reception of the year. In the second half, the Cardinals' Tim Hightower and Jason Wright scored touchdowns. But it was turnovers that decided this game; Manning's 3 interceptions were as many as he had thrown all season. The Giants scored only 3 points in the second half, ending the game on an interception to Antrel Rolle. The Giants notable streak of 38 consecutive starts by the same offensive line unit was ended here, as offensive tackle Kareem McKenzie missed the game with a groin injury. McKenzie returned the following week. How many interceptions did Arizona catch?","According to the passage, Manning threw 3 interceptions. However, it does not specify that all of these interceptions were caught by Arizona. One of the interceptions is specifically mentioned as being caught by Antrel Rolle, but it does not state that Rolle is an Arizona player. In fact, Antrel Rolle played for the New York Giants in 2010. Therefore, we can only confirm that at least one of Manning's interceptions was caught by a Giants player. Since the passage does not provide information on which team caught the other two interceptions, we cannot accurately determine the number of interceptions caught by Arizona.

How many years since 1981 did the robberies drop?","To find the number of years since 1981 that the robberies dropped, we need to look at the years provided in the passage when the number of robberies were reported: 1981, 1990, 2000, and 2010. 

The passage states that in 1981, 6,500 robberies were reported. By 1990, the number of robberies dropped to 4,800. By 2000, the number of robberies dropped to 1,700. By 2010, the number of robberies dropped to 1,100.

To find the number of years since 1981 that the robberies dropped, we can subtract 1981 from the subsequent years: 
- 1990 - 1981 = 9 years
- 2000 - 1981 = 19 years
- 2010 - 1981 = 29 years

However, the question is asking for the number of years since 1981 that the robberies dropped, which implies the total number of years from 1981 to the year when the robberies stopped dropping significantly. Based on the information provided, the robberies continued to drop until 2010. Therefore, the correct answer is the number of years from 1981 to 2010.

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in. By March of 1773, an editorial board  was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong  as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia.

history_1459_c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6,"The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?","According to the passage, in 1525 the population of Acalan was estimated to be at least 10,000, while in 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. To find the difference, we need to subtract the population in 1553 from the population in 1525. 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000.

How many people, in terms of percentage, were not either White or Asian?","To find the percentage of people who were not either White or Asian, we need to add up the percentages of all the other racial groups and the percentage of people who are Hispanic or Latino (since this category can include people of any race).

The percentage of people who are not White or Asian can be calculated as follows:

Percentage of people who are African American: 1.03%
Percentage of people who are Native American: 0.29%
Percentage of people who are Pacific Islander: 0.04%
Percentage of people who are from other races: 3.93%
Percentage of people who are from two or more races: 3.79%
Percentage of people who are Hispanic or Latino: 13.03%

Total percentage of people who are not White or Asian: 1.03 + 0.29 + 0.04 + 3.93 + 3.79 + 13.03 = 22.11%

However, this calculation includes people who are Hispanic or Latino but also White or Asian. To get the correct percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of people who are White or Asian from the total percentage.

Percentage of people who are White: 82.39%
Percentage of people who are Asian: 4.52%

Total percentage of people who are White or Asian: 82.39 + 4.52 = 86.91%

Percentage of people who are not White or Asian: 100 - 86.91 = 13.09%

But we also have 13.03% of the population that is Hispanic or Latino of any race, some of which may be White or Asian. Since we are trying to find the percentage of people who are not White or Asian, we should consider the Hispanic or Latino population separately.

Considering the Hispanic or Latino population separately, we can see that some of them may be White or Asian, but we don't know the exact percentage. However, we can say that the percentage of people who are not White or Asian is at least 13.09 - 13.03 = 0.06% (this is the percentage of people who are not White or Asian and not Hispanic or Latino) plus the percentage of Hispanic or Latino people who are not White or Asian.

Since we don't know the exact percentage of Hispanic or Latino people who are not White or Asian, we can't give an exact answer. However, we can say that the percentage of people who are not White or Asian is at least 13.09 - 13.03 = 0.06% plus the percentage of Hispanic or Latino people who are not White or Asian.

However, if we add the percentage of people who are Hispanic or Latino to the percentage of people who are not White or Asian (excluding Hispanic or Latino), we get:

13.09% (percentage of people who are not White or Asian, excluding Hispanic or Latino) + 13.03% (percentage of people who are Hispanic or Latino) = 26.12%

This is an overestimation, since some of the Hispanic or Latino people may be White or Asian. However, it gives us an upper bound for the percentage of people who are not White or Asian.

In 1625 the French marshals François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Créquy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. François Annibal d'Estrées, Duke of Estrées and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March. By this time Cardinal Richelieu remarked: How many more men larger was the army that began operations against Genoa than the reinforcements from Spain that were captured?","To find the difference in the number of men between the army that began operations against Genoa and the reinforcements from Spain, we need to subtract the number of reinforcements from the number of men in the army.

According to the passage, the army that began operations against Genoa consisted of 30,000 men, and the reinforcements from Spain consisted of 4,000 men. 

30,000 - 4,000 = 26,000

With the loss, Cleveland fell to last place in the AFC North at 3-7. How many yards longer was the longest field goal over the second longest?","To find the difference in yards between the longest field goal and the second longest, we need to compare the field goals made by the kickers. Dawson made a 35-yard field goal, and Reed made a 43-yard field goal. However, since 43 yards is longer than 35 yards, the 43-yard field goal is the longest, and the 35-yard field goal is the second longest. 

We can also see that Dawson made another field goal, a 23-yard field goal, but it is shorter than the 35-yard field goal. Therefore, the longest field goal is 43 yards, and the second longest is 35 yards.

The difference between the longest and the second longest field goal is 43 - 35 = 8 yards.

history_1313_797e963c-52f2-4f8e-ba70-5a382cda0d85,"Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century?","According to the passage, Russia suffered two major revolutions in the early 20th century: the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the February Revolution of 1917.

It can be argued that the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a culmination of the events that started in 1905, but it is still considered a separate event. Therefore, the answer is 2.

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison. A Jacobite army of around 1,200 men, mostly ""Redshanks"" , under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised . When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended.

How many years passed from the inheritance treat to when the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus?","To find the number of years that passed from the inheritance treaty to when the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus, we need to first identify the year of the inheritance treaty and the year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus.

The inheritance treaty was signed in 1537. However, the passage does not directly state that this is the starting point for the calculation. Instead, it mentions that the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, and that this was after the Elector Frederick William had been given control of Schwiebus in 1685.

Since the question asks for the number of years that passed from the inheritance treaty to when the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus, we can calculate this as follows:

1694 (year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus) - 1537 (year of the inheritance treaty) = 157 years

However, this is not the correct answer, as the passage does not directly state that the inheritance treaty is the starting point for the calculation. A more accurate interpretation of the question would be to calculate the number of years that passed from the time the Elector Frederick William was given control of Schwiebus to when the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus.

1694 (year the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus) - 1685 (year the Elector Frederick William was given control of Schwiebus) = 9 years

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne. Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000. How many months after Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia did Romania formally attach Bessarabia?","To find out how many months after Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia did Romania formally attach Bessarabia, we need to calculate the time difference between January 1918 and March 1918.

How many years after Alexander the great defeated King Porus during his invasion of Pauravas did the Indo-Greek Kingdom form?","To find the number of years between Alexander the Great's invasion and the formation of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, we need to subtract the year of the invasion from the year the kingdom was formed. 

Alexander the Great invaded Pauravas in 326 BCE, and the Indo-Greek Kingdom was formed in 180 BCE. 

So, we subtract 326 from 180: 
326 - 180 = 146 years.

However, since both dates are in BCE, we need to subtract the larger number from the smaller one in terms of absolute value, but the result will be the same.

Alem and the death of Aristóbulo del Valle. In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist. The dissolution of the Radical Civic Union resulted in the formation of a core of radical elements that recognized as their leader Hipólito Yrigoyen. Onto this core - composed of young men, recruited from the middle class, professionals, businessmen, employees, ranchers of the old federal tradition, settlers and laborers from the countryside - was Yrigoyen able to impose discipline and enthusiasm. In this context, in 1903 Hipólito Yrigoyen began his revival and reorganization. On February 29 of 1904, after 7 years of inactivity, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union said the electoral abstention of all the radicals of the Republic in the elections of representatives from the nation, senators from the capital, electors for president and vice president of the nation, and announced an armed resistance. How many years after the revolution of 1890 did the next revolution follow for the Radical Civic Union?","To find the answer, we need to look at the years mentioned in the passage. The revolution of 1890 is mentioned, and the next significant event is the crisis deepening after 1896. However, the passage does not explicitly mention another revolution. It mentions the dissolution of the Radical Civic Union in 1897 and the revival and reorganization starting in 1903. The closest event to a revolution mentioned after 1890 is the armed resistance announced in 1904, but it is not explicitly called a revolution.

However, considering the context and the events described, we can infer that the next significant event or crisis for the Radical Civic Union occurred in 1893, which is mentioned as a revolution. 

So, the calculation would be: 1893 - 1890 = 3.

How many days passed between the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre and the Battle of Aidenbach?","To find the number of days between the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre and the Battle of Aidenbach, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates.

The Sendling Christmas Day Massacre occurred on December 25, 1705, and the Battle of Aidenbach took place on January 8, 1706.

From December 25, 1705, to December 31, 1705, there are 6 days.
From January 1, 1706, to January 8, 1706, there are 8 days.

Adding these together, we get 6 + 8 = 14 days.

How many months after departing for Sicily was Edward crowned King of England?","To find the number of months between Edward's departure for Sicily and his coronation as King of England, we need to calculate the time elapsed from September 1272 to August 1274.

Edward departed for Sicily in September 1272 and was crowned King of England in August 1274, which is almost 2 years later. 

Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 2 x 12 = 24 months. However, since he was crowned in August, which is 1 month before September, we need to subtract 1 month from the total.

So, 24 months - 1 month = 23 months.

history_1092_628fc601-b5ca-4a8b-8ffc-65f1544665cb,"On 12 November , a Constituent Assembly was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917 , the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917 , the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904. The Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia gained private land and redistributed it among themselves.

How many more people, in terms of percentage, were in the 2nd and 3rd largest age groups combined compared to the largest?","To determine the answer, we first need to identify the largest, 2nd largest, and 3rd largest age groups. 

The largest age group is 26.50% from 25 to 44. 
The 2nd largest age group is 26.20% under the age of 18. 
The 3rd largest age group is 23.50% from 45 to 64.

Now, we will combine the 2nd and 3rd largest age groups: 26.20% + 23.50% = 49.70%.

Now, we will subtract the largest age group from the combined 2nd and 3rd largest age groups: 49.70% - 26.50% = 23.20%.

So the answer is {23.20}."

Then, Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake, setting out from Mopán on 7 March. To find the number of days between 25 February and 7 March, we can calculate the difference. 7 March - 25 February is 10 days (considering February has 28 days, 28 - 25 = 3, and 3 + 7 = 10). However, this calculation is correct for non-leap years. But since the exact year is 1696 which is a leap year, February has 29 days. Therefore, 29 - 25 = 4, and 4 + 7 = 11 days, and then minus 5 days, they left sick soldiers behind. So 11 - 5 = 6 days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán leaving sick soldiers behind is incorrect. The correct calculation is that 11 days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán, then 5 days later they left sick soldiers behind. However, the question is asking how many days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán leaving sick soldiers behind. So the correct answer should be 11 days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán, then 5 days later they left sick soldiers behind, therefore 11 + 5 = 16 days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they leave sick soldiers behind.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province. The Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino how many years after the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.?","The passage states that the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina in late 1943, and the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino in January 1944. Therefore, the Allies launched the attacks in Italy approximately 1-2 months after the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.

However, to determine the exact number of years, we need to consider the start of the year. Since the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in late 1943 and the Allies launched the attacks in January 1944, it is approximately 1 year after the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina is not correct. The correct answer is that the Allies launched the attacks in Italy in the same year as the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina but a few months later. However, if we are to give an answer in years, the answer would be that the Allies launched the attacks in Italy in the next year after the Chinese forces besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.

How many months passed between the Battle of Changde and the Allied attack in Italy?","The Battle of Changde took place in November 1943, and the Allied attack in Italy occurred in January 1944. To find the number of months that passed between these two events, we need to calculate the difference between January 1944 and November 1943.

January 1944 - November 1943 = 3 months (since January is 3 months after November)

However, since the question asks for the number of months that passed ""between"" the two events, we should consider the fact that the Battle of Changde started in November 1943 and the Allied attack in Italy started in January 1944, which means the Battle of Changde was still ongoing when the Allied attack in Italy began. Therefore, the correct calculation would be:

January 1944 - November 1943 = 2 months (since the Battle of Changde started in November and the Allied attack in Italy started in January, 2 months after the start of the Battle of Changde, but still during the 7-week Battle of Changde)

However, the above explanation may be incorrect, as the 7-week Battle of Changde may have ended before January 1944. Given that the Battle of Changde lasted for 7 weeks, it is likely that it ended in December 1943. 

December 1943 - November 1943 = 1 month
January 1944 - December 1943 = 1 month
1 + 1 = 2 months 

However, considering that the Battle of Changde ended in December 1943, the correct answer is the number of months between the end of the Battle of Changde and the Allied attack in Italy.

January 1944 - December 1943 = 1 month

The total number of prisoners excluded from the pardon is 293. 
- 100 were pardoned later

Since 20 prisoners died in prison, they were not pardoned, purchased amnesty, or executed. But we already know that 100 prisoners' fates are unknown.

Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.

According to the passage, Edward III pressed his claims to the French throne in 1337. However, the passage does not provide the birth year of Richard II. We know that Edward died in 1377 and that Richard II was ten years old at that time. 

To find the birth year of Richard II, we subtract 10 from 1377: 1377 - 10 = 1367.

- 2 yards to Desmond Clark
- 20 yards to Earl Bennett
- 39 yards to Devin Aromashodu

Total yards from Cutler's touchdown passes: 7 + 2 + 20 + 39 = 68 yards

Brett Favre's touchdown passes were:
- 6 yards to Visanthe Shiancoe
- 6 yards to Sidney Rice

Total yards from Favre's touchdown passes: 6 + 6 = 12 yards

Now, to find the difference in total touchdown passing yards between Cutler and Favre, we subtract Favre's total from Cutler's total:
68 - 12 = 56 yards

The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. In 1685, the Qing used former Ming loyalist Han Chinese naval specialists who had served under the Zheng family in Taiwan in the siege of Albazin. Former Ming loyalist Han Chinese troops who had served under Zheng Chenggong and who specialized at fighting with rattan shields and swords  藤牌营 were recommended to the Kangxi Emperor to reinforce Albazin against the Russians. Kangxi was impressed by a demonstration of their techniques and ordered 500 of them to defend Albazin, under Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu, a former General of Wu Sangui. These rattan shield troops did not suffer a single casualty when they defeated and cut down Russian forces traveling by rafts on the river, only using the rattan shields and swords while fighting naked. How many years did several Ming princes accompanied Koxinga Tawain?","According to the passage, several Ming princes accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662. The question asks for the number of years, but the passage provides a range of years (1661-1662), which is 1 year apart. Therefore, the answer is the duration of the period.

history_1306_cf084a28-2e17-4b61-a65b-95fb1afff749,"Russia accused Georgia of committing ""genocide"" in South Ossetia. Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces; according to Russia, the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties. Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties; according to HRW, some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the ""thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia"" reported by Russian television. In December 2008, the figures were revised down to a total of 162 South Ossetian casualties by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The war displaced a 192,000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians. Many were able to return to their homes after the war, but a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. As of May 2014, 20,272 persons remained displaced, with their return being blocked by de facto authorities. By 2014, how many Georgians were actually able to return to their homes?","To find the number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes, we need to subtract the number of displaced persons remaining in 2014 from the total number of displaced Georgians.

According to the passage, a year after the war, around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. By 2014, the total number of displaced persons (including both Ossetians and Georgians) was 20,272.

However, the passage does not provide the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014. It only mentions that the return of 20,272 persons was blocked by de facto authorities, but it does not specify the ethnic composition of these displaced persons.

Assuming that the number of displaced Georgians decreased proportionally to the total number of displaced persons, we can estimate the number of displaced Georgians in 2014.

Let's assume that the number of displaced Georgians in 2014 is x. We know that the total number of displaced persons in 2014 is 20,272, and the total number of displaced persons initially was 192,000, including both Ossetians and Georgians.

We also know that a year after the war, around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. Since the total number of displaced persons decreased from 192,000 to 20,272, the number of displaced Georgians likely decreased proportionally.

However, without more specific information, we cannot determine the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014.

But we can calculate the number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes by subtracting the number of displaced Georgians remaining in 2014 from the initial number of displaced Georgians.

According to the passage, a year after the war, around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. By 2014, the number of displaced persons remaining was 20,272. Since the passage does not provide the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014, let's assume that the number of displaced Georgians is a subset of the total number of displaced persons.

Since we cannot determine the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014, let's use the number of displaced persons remaining in 2014 as an estimate.

The number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes can be estimated by subtracting the number of displaced persons remaining in 2014 from the initial number of displaced Georgians.

Initial number of displaced Georgians (a year after the war) = 30,000
Number of displaced persons remaining in 2014 = 20,272

Number of Georgians who were able to return to their homes = Initial number of displaced Georgians - Number of displaced persons remaining in 2014
= 30,000 - 20,272
= 9,728

However, this calculation is an estimate and may not be entirely accurate, as the passage does not provide the exact number of displaced Georgians in 2014.

How many percentage points out of 100 (what percent) of the median household income in the UK is the lowest that is considered to be above the poverty line?","To determine the percentage of the median household income that is considered to be above the poverty line, we need to consider the percentage that defines the poverty line. According to the passage, the poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. Therefore, any household income above 60% of the median household income is considered to be above the poverty line.

Since we want to find the percentage points out of 100, we can subtract 60 from 100 to get the percentage points above the poverty line. However, the question asks for the lowest percentage that is considered to be above the poverty line, which would be the percentage just above 60%. Therefore, the answer would be 100 - 60 = 40 percentage points above the poverty line, but the lowest percentage above the poverty line would be just above 60%, which is still 60% + 1% or more. But in terms of percentage points out of 100 that is considered to be above the poverty line the answer would be 40%.

On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays.

How many points was New England winning by at halftime?","To determine the points New England was winning by at halftime, we need to look at the score at the end of the first half. The passage mentions that the Dolphins' final drive of the half ended with a false start and a sack of Pennington, and then the half ended. 

Before this, the Patriots had taken the lead with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss, making the score 17-14 in favor of the Patriots. Then, the Dolphins had a drive but were unable to score before the half ended. 

Therefore, the Patriots were winning by 3 points at halftime.

history_2361_6406a4e8-2ee7-4d56-b479-d5e8f1a6c96c,"The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunter-gatherer. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated. How many years after wild grains began being harvested was the potato domesticated, at its earliest?","To find the answer, we need to determine the time difference between when wild grains began being harvested (at least 105,000 years ago) and when the potato was domesticated (between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago). 

Since we are looking for the earliest time the potato was domesticated, we will use the earlier date in the range, which is 10,000 years ago.

Now, we can calculate the time difference: 105,000 years ago (when wild grains began being harvested) - 10,000 years ago (when the potato was domesticated) = 95,000 years.

history_2650_b06d3130-f65d-4da9-b87e-a20a62dd8191,"The U.S. Marine Corps issued a request for proposals (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers. By 2017, the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of 3,500 A2 series Humvees, 9,500 ECV Humvees, and 5,000 JLTVs, with 18,000 vehicles in total. Humvees in service with the Marine Corps will be upgraded through 2030. The Marines shelved the Humvee modernization effort in March 2015 due to budget cuts. How many of the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet by 2017 will not consist of the A2 series?","To find the number of vehicles that will not consist of the A2 series, we need to subtract the number of A2 series Humvees from the total number of vehicles. 

According to the passage, by 2017, the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of 3,500 A2 series Humvees, 9,500 ECV Humvees, and 5,000 JLTVs, with 18,000 vehicles in total.

The total number of non-A2 series vehicles is 9,500 ECV Humvees + 5,000 JLTVs = 14,500 vehicles.

So, the number of vehicles that will not consist of the A2 series is 14,500.

Answer: {14,500}"
history_2619_a625695a-d2b9-4b56-a2f6-efecfb49161d,"Northern Europe is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,350-2,900) in Sweden, about 2,200 in Finland, about 700 in Estonia and 70 in Norway, totaling to nearly 5,000 individuals in the wild. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500-3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of Austria until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss. The small group of bears living in the Carinthian-Slovenian Alps is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population. How many more large bears are there in Sweden compared to Finland?","According to the passage, there are approximately 2,500 large bears in Sweden and about 2,200 in Finland. To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of bears in Finland from the number of bears in Sweden. 

2,500 (Sweden) - 2,200 (Finland) = 300

Answer: {300}"
