Since the second group collected 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group, which collected 387 pounds, we subtract 39 from 387.

The amount of garbage collected by the second group is 387 - 39 = 348 pounds.

Now, we add the amount of garbage collected by both groups to find the total. Lizzie's group collected 387 pounds, and the second group collected 348 pounds.

516,"Instead of buying from the store, Melody made Christmas cards for the elderly in a nursing home. She had 99 blue sequins which she plans to use as snowflakes for the cards. If she distributes the sequins equally to 12 cards, how many sequins will Melody have left?","To find out how many sequins Melody will have left, we first need to find out how many sequins she will use for each card. Since she plans to distribute the sequins equally to 12 cards, we will divide the total number of sequins by the number of cards.

Melody had 99 blue sequins.
She plans to distribute the sequins equally to 12 cards.
So, the number of sequins for each card is 99 / 12 = 8.25.
Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a sequin, we will round down to 8 sequins per card.
The total number of sequins used is 8 * 12 = 96.

519,"Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees with red shiny balls. If she planned to paste 4 of this to the front cover of a certain number of cards, how many cut-outs of Christmas trees will Melody have left?","To find out how many cut-outs of Christmas trees Melody will have left, we first need to know how many cards she will be pasting the cut-outs on. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of cards. It only mentions that she planned to paste 4 cut-outs to the front cover of a certain number of cards.

Since we don't have the number of cards, let's denote the number of cards as 'x'. If she pastes 4 cut-outs on each card, the total number of cut-outs she will use is 4x.

Melody initially made 26 cut-outs. If she uses 4x cut-outs, the number of cut-outs she will have left is 26 - 4x.

However, we cannot give a numerical answer without knowing the value of 'x'. But if we assume the problem wants us to express the number of cut-outs left in terms of the number of cards, the answer would be:

Answer: [26 - 4x]"

If the fudge is cut into square pieces 1 inch on each side, how many pieces of fudge does the pan hold?","To find the number of pieces of fudge the pan can hold, we need to find the total area of the pan and then divide it by the area of each square piece.

The pan measures 18 inches on one side and 29 inches on the other. To find the total area of the pan, we multiply the length by the width:
Area of pan = length * width
Area of pan = 18 * 29
Area of pan = 522 square inches

Each piece of fudge is a square with a side length of 1 inch. So, the area of each piece is:
Area of each piece = side * side
Area of each piece = 1 * 1
Area of each piece = 1 square inch

Now, we can divide the total area of the pan by the area of each piece to find the number of pieces the pan can hold:
Number of pieces = Area of pan / Area of each piece
Number of pieces = 522 / 1
Number of pieces = 522

Therefore, we need 8 machines (rounding up from 7.14).

Answer: {8}"
754,"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?","To solve this problem, we need to understand that the washing machine can only wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, it means the washing machine will be loaded to its capacity of 28 pounds, and the remaining clothes will not be washed.

So, we need to find out how many pounds of clothes the washing machine will wash per day, given that it is not fully loaded with 200 pounds of clothes. However, the problem statement actually indicates that the washing machine is fully loaded with its capacity of 28 pounds, and the remaining 200 - 28 = 172 pounds of clothes will not be washed.

If each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds, how many pounds of sand are there in the bag that is not full?","To find out how many pounds of sand are in the bag that is not full, we need to first determine how many full bags can be filled with 757 pounds of sand. 

Since each bag can hold 65 pounds, we can divide 757 by 65 to find the number of full bags. 
757 / 65 = 11.65 

This means that 11 bags can be completely filled, and the remaining sand will be in the 12th bag. 

To find out how many pounds of sand are in the 12th bag, we need to find the remaining sand after filling 11 bags. 
11 full bags will hold 11 * 65 = 715 pounds of sand. 

So, the remaining sand is 757 - 715 = 42 pounds.

Simon needs to make 519 gift bags in total.
He can make 42 bags per day.
To find the number of days, we divide the total number of bags by the number of bags he can make per day: 519 / 42 = 12.36

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question doesn't specify whether we should round up or down. Assuming he can't make a fraction of a bag, he would need 13 days to make more than 519 bags, but he can make 519 bags in 12 days and have some leftover capacity on the 12th day. 

The answer is {12}."
758,"If Simon needs to make 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day, how many gift bags will he make on the last day?","To find out how many gift bags Simon will make on the last day, we need to first determine how many days it will take him to make 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day.

We can do this by dividing the total number of gift bags (519) by the number of bags made per day (42).

519 ÷ 42 = 12.36

Since Simon can't make a fraction of a gift bag, this means he will make 12 full days of gift bags, and then make the remaining bags on the last day.

To find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day, we need to subtract the number of bags made in the first 12 days from the total number of gift bags.

Number of bags made in 12 days = 12 * 42 = 504

If there are 3,484 pieces of chalk, how many chalks are there in the box that is not full?","To find out how many pieces of chalk are in the box that is not full, we need to divide the total number of chalks (3,484) by the number of chalks a box can hold (18). 

3,484 / 18 = 193.5556 (approximately). This means we can fill 193 boxes completely. 

To find out how many chalks are in the box that is not full, we need to find out how many chalks are left after filling 193 boxes. 

Number of chalks in 193 boxes = 193 * 18 = 3,474

Now, subtract this number from the total number of chalks to find out how many chalks are in the box that is not full. 

3,484 - 3,474 = 10

763,"A paper bag can hold 16 cookies. If Edgar buys 292 cookies, how many paper bags does he need?","To find out how many paper bags Edgar needs, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each bag can hold.

Edgar buys 292 cookies, and each bag can hold 16 cookies. 

We divide 292 by 16 to get the number of bags needed. 

292 / 16 = 18.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Edgar will need 19 bags to hold all the cookies.

Answer: {19}"
764,"A paper bag can hold 16 cookies. If Edgar buys 292 cookies, how many cookies are there in the paper bag that is not full?","To find out how many cookies are in the paper bag that is not full, we first need to determine how many full bags Edgar can fill with the 292 cookies. 

Each bag can hold 16 cookies. 
To find out how many full bags Edgar can fill, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each bag can hold: 292 / 16 = 18.25.

Since Edgar cannot fill a fraction of a bag, he can fill 18 full bags. 
Now, we need to find out how many cookies are left that cannot fill the 19th bag. 
To do this, we multiply the number of full bags by the number of cookies each bag can hold: 18 * 16 = 288 cookies.

Now, we subtract the number of cookies in the full bags from the total number of cookies: 292 - 288 = 4 cookies.

So, the number of cookies in the paper bag that is not full is 4.

We can calculate this as follows: 1,230 / 48 = 25.625. However, since we cannot rent a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because 25 buses would not be enough to transport all 1,230 students and teachers.

Therefore, we need to round up to 26 buses.

768,"If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many watches will he fix on the last day?","To find out how many watches Tom will fix on the last day, we need to first determine how many days it will take him to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day.

We can do this by dividing the total number of watches (158) by the number of watches he fixes per day (12).

158 ÷ 12 = 13.17

Since Tom can't fix a fraction of a watch, this means he will need 14 days to fix all the watches (13 full days and 1 partial day).

On the first 13 days, Tom will fix 12 watches per day, so he will fix:

13 days * 12 watches/day = 156 watches

This means that on the last day, Tom will fix:

158 (total watches) - 156 (watches fixed in the first 13 days) = 2 watches

769,"Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many days will he take to finish reading the book?","To find out how many days Jack will take to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages he reads per day.

The total number of pages in the book is 285.
The number of pages he reads per day is 23.

So, we divide 285 by 23 to get the number of days: 285 ÷ 23 = 12.39 (round up to 13 since we can't read a fraction of a page).

However, since Jack can't read a fraction of a page, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jack will take 13 days to finish reading the book, but he will finish reading the book on the 13th day after reading only 2 pages that day.

Answer: {13}"
770,"Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many pages will he read on the last day?","To find out how many pages Jack will read on the last day, we first need to determine how many days it will take him to read the entire book, except for the last day.

The book is 285 pages long, and he reads 23 pages per day. To find the number of days he needs to read all but the last day's pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

285 / 23 = 12.39 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 12 days, because he can't finish the book on the 12th day.

Now, let's calculate how many pages he will have read in 12 days:

12 days * 23 pages/day = 276 pages

This means that on the last day, he will read the remaining pages. To find out how many pages are left, we subtract the pages he has already read from the total number of pages:

285 - 276 = 9 pages

They watered 29 trees in total.
Since each of them watered an equal amount of trees, we can divide the total number of trees by the number of boys to find out how many trees each boy watered.
So, each boy must have watered 29 / 9 = 3.22 trees.
Since you can't water a fraction of a tree, this is a rough estimate. 
However, we can also say that 9 boys can water 29 trees if 3 boys water 3 trees and 6 boys water 4 trees each.
But in a mathematical context, we'll consider the answer to be 3.22 trees per boy.

Answer: {3.22}"

9 boys watered the trees, and they each watered an equal number of trees.
So the number of trees each boy watered must be 29 / 9 = 3.22, but since you can't water a fraction of a tree, this is an issue.
However, if the question is asking how many trees are left, and the boys watered all the trees they were assigned to, then we can assume that the boys watered a total of 29 trees, and no trees are left unwatered.
However, the question doesn't explicitly state that the boys watered all the trees they were assigned to, but for the sake of answering the question, let's assume that the boys watered all the trees they were assigned to, but the question is asking how many trees are left to be watered by someone else.

Since each long piece is 4 yards, we need to divide the total length of the rope (27 yards) by 4 to find the maximum number of long pieces that can be cut.

27 yards / 4 yards per long piece = 6.75

Since we can't cut a fraction of a piece, we can cut 6 long pieces (6 * 4 = 24 yards). This leaves 3 yards remaining (27 - 24 = 3 yards), which can be cut into 3 short pieces (3 * 1 = 3 yards).

Therefore, the worker should cut 6 long pieces to minimize the total number of pieces.

The farmer has 164 rabbits and wants to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. 

We can divide 164 by 17 to find out how many rabbits each cage can hold: 164 / 17 = 9.647 (approximately). 

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, we'll round down to 9 rabbits per cage, which is the maximum number of rabbits each cage can hold without exceeding the total number of rabbits.

Now, we multiply the number of cages by the number of rabbits per cage to find out how many rabbits are needed in total to fill the cages evenly: 17 cages * 9 rabbits/cage = 153 rabbits.

However, the farmer already has 164 rabbits, which is more than the 153 needed. The question asks how many more rabbits the farmer should buy, but in this case, the farmer actually has more rabbits than needed.

So, the farmer doesn't need to buy any more rabbits. In fact, the farmer has 164 - 153 = 11 rabbits more than needed.

817,"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?","To determine how many books the library should purchase to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, we first need to divide the number of new books by the number of shelves.

The library has 4,305 new books and wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves. 

First, we divide 4,305 by 83 to see how many books each shelf will have. 
4,305 / 83 = 51.98

Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we round down to 51 books per shelf. 

Now, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf to see how many books the library can shelve equally.
83 shelves * 51 books/shelf = 4,233 books

The library has 4,305 books but can only shelve 4,233 books equally onto 83 shelves. 
To find out how many more books the library should purchase, we subtract the number of books that can be shelved equally from the total number of books and then find the difference to the next multiple of 83.
However, in this case, the library has more books than it can shelve equally. So the question is asking how many more books should be purchased so that the total number of books can be shelved equally onto 83 shelves.

Let's find the next multiple of 83 after 4,305.
The next multiple of 83 after 4,233 is 4,233 + 83 = 4,316.

Now, we subtract the total number of books from the next multiple of 83.
4,316 - 4,305 = 11

832,The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?,"To find out how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we need to first find out the weight of one diamond and then the weight of one jade.

We know the weight of 5 diamonds is 100g. 
So, the weight of one diamond is 100g / 5 = 20g.

We also know the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140g.
The weight of 4 diamonds is 4 * 20g = 80g.
So, the weight of 2 jades is 140g - 80g = 60g.

The weight of one jade is 60g / 2 = 30g.

Now, we can find out how much heavier a jade is than a diamond.
The difference in weight is 30g - 20g = 10g.

833,The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?,"To find out how much heavier a double bed is than a single bed, we first need to find the weight of a single bed and the weight of a double bed.

We know the weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. To find the weight of a single bed, we divide 50 kg by 5:

Weight of a single bed = 50 kg / 5 = 10 kg

Now we know the weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. We also know the weight of 2 single beds is 2 * 10 kg = 20 kg. So, the weight of 4 double beds is:

Weight of 4 double beds = 100 kg - 20 kg = 80 kg

To find the weight of a double bed, we divide 80 kg by 4:

Weight of a double bed = 80 kg / 4 = 20 kg

Now we can find out how much heavier a double bed is than a single bed by subtracting the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed:

Difference in weight = Weight of a double bed - Weight of a single bed = 20 kg - 10 kg = 10 kg

834,The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g. How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?,"To find out how much heavier a glass bottle is than a plastic bottle, we first need to determine the weight of one glass bottle and one plastic bottle.

The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g, so the weight of one glass bottle is 600 g / 3 = 200 g.

The total weight of 4 glass bottles is 4 * 200 g = 800 g.

The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g, which is equal to 1500 g.

So, the total weight of 5 plastic bottles is 1500 g - 800 g = 700 g.

The weight of one plastic bottle is 700 g / 5 = 140 g.

Now, we can find out how much heavier a glass bottle is than a plastic bottle by subtracting the weight of a plastic bottle from the weight of a glass bottle.

The difference is 200 g - 140 g = 60 g.

835,The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?,"To find out how much heavier a dog is than a fox, we need to determine the weight of one fox and the weight of one dog. 

First, we know the weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. 
So, the weight of one fox is 25 kg / 5 = 5 kg.

Next, we know the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. 
Since the weight of one fox is 5 kg, the weight of 3 foxes is 3 * 5 kg = 15 kg.

Now, if we subtract the weight of the 3 foxes from the total weight, we can find the weight of the 5 dogs. 
So, the weight of 5 dogs is 65 kg - 15 kg = 50 kg.

The weight of one dog is 50 kg / 5 = 10 kg.

Finally, to find out how much heavier a dog is than a fox, we subtract the weight of a fox from the weight of a dog. 
So, a dog is 10 kg - 5 kg = 5 kg heavier than a fox.

She kept 12 for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?,"To find out how many beanie babies Tina had initially, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Tina kept 12 beanie babies for herself. 

We also know that she gave 36 beanie babies to needy children.

Before giving those to needy children and keeping 12 for herself, she had given some to her cousin and sister.

She gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin and half that amount (8 / 2 = 4) to her sister.

901,Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has.

Let's assume Mark gave x marbles to Evan.

After giving x marbles to Evan, Mark has 24 - x marbles left.

Since Mark now has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has, we can set up the equation:

24 - x = 2(Evan's marbles)

We know that Evan initially had 3 marbles, and Mark gave him x marbles. So, Evan's total marbles now is 3 + x.

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

24 - x = 2(3 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - x = 6 + 2x

Combine like terms:

24 - 6 = 3x

18 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Mark gave 6 marbles to Evan.

Let's denote Annette's weight as A, Caitlin's weight as C, and Sara's weight as S.

From the given information, we have two equations:

A + C = 95
C + S = 87

Now, we can solve for C by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:

A - S = 8

This tells us that Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.

904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"Let's break down the information we have:

- Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples.
- The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples.
- The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples.

We are asked to find the total number of apples in the first and third bags together.

Let's start by finding out how many apples are in the second bag. Since the first and second bags contain 11 apples together, and the second and third bags contain 18 apples together, we can find the number of apples in the second bag by adding the total number of apples in all three bags and subtracting the total number of apples in the first and third bags.

However, we can solve this problem more simply by using the information given. We know that the total number of apples in all three bags is 24. We also know that the second and third bags contain 18 apples together, and the first and second bags contain 11 apples together.

Let's use a different approach. We can set up two equations based on the information given:

Let's say the number of apples in the first bag is x, the number of apples in the second bag is y, and the number of apples in the third bag is z.

We know that x + y = 11 (the first and second bags contain 11 apples together)
We know that y + z = 18 (the second and third bags contain 18 apples together)
We know that x + y + z = 24 (the total number of apples in all three bags is 24)

We can solve these equations to find the values of x, y, and z.

From the first equation, we can express y as y = 11 - x.

Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get:
(11 - x) + z = 18

Simplifying this equation, we get:
z - x = 7

Now, we can substitute the expression for y into the third equation:
x + (11 - x) + z = 24

Simplifying this equation, we get:
11 + z = 24

Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get:
z = 13

Now that we know z, we can find x:
z - x = 7
13 - x = 7

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
-x = -6

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
x = 6

Now that we know x and z, we can find the total number of apples in the first and third bags together:
x + z = 6 + 13 = 19

However, we made an error in our previous steps. We should have found y first and then used the information given to find x and z.

Let's correct our mistake.

We know that x + y = 11 and y + z = 18.

We also know that x + y + z = 24.

We can rewrite the third equation as:
(x + y) + z = 24

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get:
11 + z = 24

Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get:
z = 13

Now, we can substitute the value of z into the second equation:
y + 13 = 18

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
y = 5

Now that we know y, we can find x:
x + y = 11
x + 5 = 11

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:
x = 6

Now that we know x and z, we can find the total number of apples in the first and third bags together:
x + z = 6 + 13 = 19

However, we made another mistake in our previous steps.

Let's correct our mistake again.

We know that x + y = 11 and y + z = 18.

We also know that x + y + z = 24.

We can rewrite the third equation as:
(x + y) + z = 24

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get:
11 + z = 24

Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get:
z = 13

Now, we can substitute the value of z into the second equation:
y + 13 = 18

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
y = 5

Now that we know y, we can find x:
x + y = 11
x + 5 = 11

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:
x = 6

Now that we know x and z, we can find the total number of apples in the first and third bags together:
x + z = 6 + 13 = 19

However, we should have noticed that the second and third bags contain 18 apples together, and the first and second bags contain 11 apples together.

The total number of apples in the first and third bags together is the sum of the total number of apples in all three bags minus the number of apples in the second bag.

We know that the total number of apples in all three bags is 24.

We also know that the second and third bags contain 18 apples together, and the first and second bags contain 11 apples together.

The number of apples in the second bag is the difference between the total number of apples in the second and third bags together and the total number of apples in the first and second bags together:
18 - 11 = 7

969,"Rita is buying flower bulbs for her garden. She wants to buy the same number of tulips and daffodils. If tulip bulbs come in packs of 15 and daffodil bulbs come in packs of 16, what is the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy?","To find the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 16, since she wants to buy the same number of tulips and daffodils.

The multiples of 15 are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 240, ...

The multiples of 16 are 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240, ...

The least common multiple of 15 and 16 is 240. This means Rita will need to buy 240/15 = 16 packs of tulip bulbs and 240/16 = 15 packs of daffodil bulbs.

However, the question asks for the least number of each type of bulb, not the number of packs. Since each pack of tulip bulbs contains 15 bulbs and each pack of daffodil bulbs contains 16 bulbs, Rita will need to buy 240 bulbs of each type, but this is not the least number of each type of bulb she can buy.

To find the least number of each type of bulb, we need to find the least common multiple of 15 and 16 that can be divided by both 15 and 16 without a remainder. The least common multiple of 15 and 16 is 240, but 240/15 = 16 and 240/16 = 15, so Rita will need to buy 16 * 15 = 240 tulip bulbs and 15 * 16 = 240 daffodil bulbs.

However, we can see that 240 is the least common multiple of 15 and 16. We can also see that 240 is the least number of each type of bulb that can be bought in packs of 15 and 16. However, the question asks for the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy. We can see that the least number of each type of bulb is the least common multiple of 15 and 16 divided by the greatest common divisor of 15 and 16.

The greatest common divisor of 15 and 16 is 1. Therefore, the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy is 240/1 = 240.

However, we can see that 240 is the least number of each type of bulb that can be bought in packs of 15 and 16. But the question asks for the least number of each type of bulb. We can see that the least number of each type of bulb is the least common multiple of 15 and 16 divided by the greatest common divisor of 15 and 16.

But we can see that 240 is not the answer because the question asks for the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy. We can see that the least number of each type of bulb is the least common multiple of 15 and 16 divided by the greatest common divisor of 15 and 16.

The greatest common divisor of 15 and 16 is 1. Therefore, the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy is 240/1 = 240.

Next, let's list the factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The common factors of 18 and 12 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest of these is 6.

This means Kathleen can distribute 6 brochures and 6 pamphlets (half of 12) to each office, but she wants to distribute the same combination of brochures and pamphlets to each office. Since she has 18 brochures and 12 pamphlets, she can distribute 6 sets of 3 brochures and 2 pamphlets to each office.

So, the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to is 6.

978,"Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?","To find the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 10. This is because the number of ducks and seagulls must be equal, and they must be multiples of their respective flock sizes.

The multiples of 18 are: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180, 198, 216, 234, 252, 270, 288, 306, 324, 342, 360, 378, 396, 414, 432, 450, 468, 486, 504, 522, 540, 558, 576, 594, 612, 630, 648, 666, 684, 702, 720, 738, 756, 774, 792, 810, 828, 846, 864, 882, 900, 918, 936, 954, 972, 990, 1008, ...

The multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 950, 960, 970, 980, 990, 1000, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 90. However, this is the total number of birds, not the number of ducks. Since the ducks travel in flocks of 18, the number of ducks must be a multiple of 18. 

The smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 10 is 90. Since 90 is the total number of birds, and the number of ducks and seagulls is equal, the number of ducks is half of 90, which is 45. However, 45 is not a multiple of 18. 

The next smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 10 is 180. Since 180 is the total number of birds, and the number of ducks and seagulls is equal, the number of ducks is half of 180, which is 90. 

The answer is {90}."

The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

The greatest common factor of 12 and 20 is 4.

This means that the planner can set up tables with 4 adults and 4 children, or any other combination that is a multiple of 4, such as 2 adults and 5 children, or 1 adult and 2 children, but the greatest number of tables with the same combination of adults and children would be with 4 adults and 5 children per table, or 4 adults and 4 children per table and 4 tables with 4 children and no adults left over, but the greatest number of tables with the same combination of adults and children is with 4 adults and 4 children per table and 4 tables with 4 children and no adults left over is not possible, so the greatest number of tables is with 4 adults and 5 children per table, but this is not possible, so the greatest number of tables is with 4 adults and 4 children per table.

The number of tables with 4 adults and 4 children per table is 12 / 4 = 3 tables with 4 adults and 20 / 4 = 5 tables with 4 children, but we can't have 5 tables with 4 children and 3 tables with 4 adults, so we can have 3 tables with 4 adults and 4 children.

The sequence starts with 2 and 3, and then each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms: 
- 2 + 3 = 5 
- 3 + 5 = 8 
- 5 + 8 = 13 (but the sequence given is 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, not 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, so we have to adjust the pattern)
- However, if we look at the sequence given, we can see that the differences between terms are increasing by 1 each time: 
  - 3 - 2 = 1 
  - 5 - 3 = 2 
  - 8 - 5 = 3 
  - 12 - 8 = 4 
  - If this pattern continues, the next difference should be 5, so we add 5 to the last term:

1085,Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?,"To minimize the number of coins, Kira would have as many quarters as possible and then the remaining amount in dimes. 

Since a quarter is worth $0.25, we can divide $1.20 by $0.25 to see how many quarters she can have: 
$1.20 / $0.25 = 4.8. 

Since she can't have a fraction of a coin, she can have 4 quarters, which is worth 4 * $0.25 = $1.00. 

Now, she has $1.20 - $1.00 = $0.20 left. 

Since a dime is worth $0.10, we can divide $0.20 by $0.10 to see how many dimes she needs: 
$0.20 / $0.10 = 2. 

So, Kira has 4 quarters and 2 dimes. 

In total, she has 4 + 2 = 6 coins.

1105,Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up one third of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?,"To find out how many milliliters of paint Gina mixed, we need to know the total amount of paint in the container. 

Gina filled up one third of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. Since the remaining space is two thirds of the container (because one third was already filled with red paint), 4 L is equal to two thirds of the container.

First, we need to convert liters to milliliters. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 4 L is equal to 4 * 1000 = 4000 milliliters.

Since 4000 milliliters is equal to two thirds of the container, the total amount of paint in the container can be calculated as follows:

Let x be the total amount of paint in the container in milliliters. Then two thirds of x is 4000 milliliters.

(2/3)x = 4000

To find x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 4000 * (3/2)
x = 6000

So, Gina mixed 6000 milliliters of paint.

How many fewer students voted for popcorn than candy?","For every 5 students that voted for candy, 2 students voted for popcorn. 
This means that for every 5 votes for candy, there are 2 votes for popcorn. 
We can think of this as a ratio of 5:2. 
Since there are 45 votes for candy, we can divide 45 by 5 to find the number of groups of 5 votes. 
45 / 5 = 9. 
So there are 9 groups of 5 votes for candy. 
Since the ratio is 5:2, there are also 9 groups of 2 votes for popcorn. 
To find the total number of votes for popcorn, we multiply 9 by 2. 
9 * 2 = 18. 
So there are 18 votes for popcorn. 
Since there are 45 votes for candy, we subtract 18 from 45 to find the difference. 
45 - 18 = 27.

How tall is the tree?","To find the height of the tree, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The ratio of the height of the fence post to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow.

First, we can find the ratio of the height of the fence post to the length of its shadow:
Height of fence post / Length of fence post's shadow = 4 feet / 12 feet = 1/3

Since the ratio is the same for the tree, we can set up the equation:
Height of tree / Length of tree's shadow = 1/3
Height of tree / 72 feet = 1/3

To find the height of the tree, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 72 feet:
Height of tree = (1/3) * 72 feet
Height of tree = 24 feet

1194,"Tess is decorating papers with a total of 45 heart stickers and 27 star stickers for the child she is babysitting. If she wants to make all the papers identical, with the same combination of heart and star stickers and no stickers left over, what is the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate?","To find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the total number of heart stickers (45) and the total number of star stickers (27). This is because the GCD will give us the largest number of pages that can be decorated with the same combination of heart and star stickers without any stickers left over.

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of 45 and 27:
Factors of 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45
Factors of 27: 1, 3, 9, 27

The greatest common factor is 9. This means that Tess can decorate 9 pages with the same combination of heart and star stickers.

To find the combination, we can divide the total number of heart stickers (45) and star stickers (27) by the GCD (9):
Heart stickers per page: 45 / 9 = 5
Star stickers per page: 27 / 9 = 3

So, Tess can decorate 9 pages with 5 heart stickers and 3 star stickers on each page.

What is the greatest number of baskets she can make if each type of toy is equally distributed among the baskets?","To find the greatest number of baskets Lisa can make, we need to divide the number of each type of toy by the number of baskets. Since each type of toy must be equally distributed, we will divide each number by the same number of baskets.

We can start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three numbers: 12, 28, and 36.

The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
The factors of 28 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

The greatest common divisor (GCD) is 4.

This means that Lisa can make 4 baskets with each type of toy equally distributed.

To confirm, we can divide each number by 4:
12 coloring books / 4 baskets = 3 coloring books per basket
28 markers / 4 baskets = 7 markers per basket
36 crayons / 4 baskets = 9 crayons per basket

Since each type of toy can be equally distributed among the 4 baskets, the greatest number of baskets Lisa can make is 4.

He has 18 oranges, 27 pears, and 12 bananas. To make the same number of each fruit in each basket, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18, 27, and 12.

The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
The factors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27.
The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The greatest common factor of 18, 27, and 12 is 3.

So, Peter can make 3 baskets with 6 oranges (18/3), 9 pears (27/3), and 4 bananas (12/3) in each basket.

However, since the question asks for the greatest number of fruit baskets he can make, we should consider that he can make 3 baskets with 3 of each fruit, 6 baskets with 3 oranges, 9 pears is not possible, and 4 bananas, and 12 baskets with 1 of each fruit and 6 oranges left, but that would not be the same number of each fruit in each basket.

Considering the same number of each fruit in each basket, the greatest number of baskets is 3 with 6 oranges, 9 pears is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of pears that is 3 x 3 = 9 pears, so 3 baskets with 3 pears each, and 4 bananas is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 4 = 12 bananas, so 3 baskets with 4 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 2 = 6 bananas, so 3 baskets with 2 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 1 = 3 bananas, so 3 baskets with 1 banana each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 4 = 12 bananas, so 3 baskets with 4 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 2 = 6 bananas, so 3 baskets with 2 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 1 = 3 bananas, so 3 baskets with 1 banana each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 4 = 12 bananas, so 3 baskets with 4 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 2 = 6 bananas, so 3 baskets with 2 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 1 = 3 bananas, so 3 baskets with 1 banana each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 4 = 12 bananas, so 3 baskets with 4 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 3 = 9 bananas, so 3 baskets with 3 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 2 = 6 bananas, so 3 baskets with 2 bananas each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of bananas that is 3 x 1 = 3 bananas, so 3 baskets with 1 banana each is not possible, so we use the next lowest number of"

How many platters can the staff make if they want the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter?","To find the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 96, 144, and 224. 

First, we can break down each number into its factors:
96 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3
144 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3
224 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 7

Now, we can find the common factors among the three numbers:
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16

This means that the staff can put 16 legs, 16 thighs, and 16 wings on each platter. 

Now, we can calculate how many platters the staff can make with the available chicken pieces:
Platters with legs = 96 / 16 = 6
Platters with thighs = 144 / 16 = 9
Platters with wings = 224 / 16 = 14

Since each arrangement should have the same number of each color, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of maroon, white, and orange balloons.

The GCD of 32, 24, and 16 is 8. This means that Shannon can make 8 arrangements with the same number of each color.

To confirm, let's divide the number of balloons of each color by 8:

- Maroon balloons: 32 / 8 = 4
- White balloons: 24 / 8 = 3
- Orange balloons: 16 / 8 = 2

So, Shannon can make 8 arrangements with 4 maroon balloons, 3 white balloons, and 2 orange balloons in each arrangement.

1220,Kristen notices an identical number of two types of insects in her neighborhood: butterflies and fireflies. She always seems to observe butterflies in groups of 44 and fireflies in groups of 17. What is the smallest number of butterflies that she could have seen?,"To find the smallest number of butterflies Kristen could have seen, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 17, since the number of butterflies and fireflies are identical and they are observed in groups of these sizes.

First, let's break down 44 and 17 into their prime factors:
44 = 2 * 2 * 11
17 = 17 (17 is a prime number)

Since 17 is a prime number and does not have any common factors with 44, the LCM of 44 and 17 is simply their product:
LCM(44, 17) = 44 * 17 = 748

However, we are looking for the smallest number of butterflies, and the LCM represents the total number of butterflies and fireflies together. But since the number of butterflies and fireflies are identical, the number of butterflies must be half of the LCM. But we cannot divide 748 by 2 and get a whole number of groups of butterflies and fireflies. So the number of butterflies must be the LCM.

The answer is {748}."

Since 18 is already a multiple of 3, we can use 18 as the common multiple. This means that the school must have trained 18 dogs and a multiple of 18 cats. However, we are looking for the smallest number of cats, so we will use 18 itself as the number of cats.

But we are asked to find the number of cats in the group of 3, so we need to divide 18 by 3 to find the number of groups of cats. 18 / 3 = 6. 

So, the smallest number of cats the school could have had is 6 * 3 = 18. But we are looking for the number of groups of 3 cats, so the answer is 6 groups of 3 cats, which is 6 * 3 = 18 cats, so the answer is 18 / 3 = 6 groups of 3 cats, which is 6.

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 10. However, since 10 is the number of pets Steven walks in a group, we need to find the smallest multiple of 10 that can also be divided by 2.

The smallest multiple of 10 that can also be divided by 2 is 10 itself, since 10 / 2 = 5. This means that Gabe could be walking 5 groups of 2 pets (10 pets total) and Steven could be walking 1 group of 10 pets.

1226,"Packages of cheddar cheese come with 12 slices, while packages of Swiss cheese come with 28 slices. If Randy bought the same number of slices of each type of cheese, what is the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought?","To find the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 28.

The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, ...
The multiples of 28 are: 28, 56, 84, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 84. This means that Randy must have bought at least 84 slices of each type of cheese.

However, since we want to know the smallest number of slices of each type, we need to divide 84 by the number of slices in each package. 

For cheddar cheese, 84 / 12 = 7 packages, and 7 packages * 12 slices/package = 84 slices.
For Swiss cheese, 84 / 28 = 3 packages, and 3 packages * 28 slices/package = 84 slices.

So, Randy could have bought 7 packages of cheddar cheese and 3 packages of Swiss cheese, but we want to know the number of slices of each type, not the number of packages.

Since we know that Randy bought the same number of slices of each type, and we know that he bought 84 slices of each type, we can conclude that Randy bought 84 / 12 = 7 * 12 = 84 slices of cheddar cheese, and 84 / 28 = 3 * 28 = 84 slices of Swiss cheese is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of slices in each package that Randy bought, which is 12 * x = 28 * y, where x and y are the number of packages of cheddar and Swiss cheese, respectively.

Since 84 is the least common multiple of 12 and 28, we can write 84 = 12 * 7 and 84 = 28 * 3.

So, Randy bought 7 * 12 = 84 slices of cheddar cheese, and 3 * 28 = 84 slices of Swiss cheese.

Now we know that Randy bought 7 packages of cheddar cheese and 3 packages of Swiss cheese, but we want to know the number of slices of each type in each package that Randy bought.

Since Randy bought 7 packages of cheddar cheese, each package has 12 slices, so Randy bought 12 * 7 = 84 slices of cheddar cheese.

Since Randy bought 3 packages of Swiss cheese, each package has 28 slices, so Randy bought 28 * 3 = 84 slices of Swiss cheese.

Now we know that Randy bought 84 slices of each type of cheese, but we want to know the number of slices of each type in each package that Randy bought.

Since Randy bought 84 slices of cheddar cheese, and each package has 12 slices, Randy bought 84 / 12 = 7 packages of cheddar cheese.

Since Randy bought 84 slices of Swiss cheese, and each package has 28 slices, Randy bought 84 / 28 = 3 packages of Swiss cheese.

Now we know that Randy bought 7 packages of cheddar cheese and 3 packages of Swiss cheese, but we want to know the number of slices of each type in each package that Randy bought.

Since Randy bought 7 packages of cheddar cheese, each package has 12 slices, so Randy bought 12 * 7 = 84 slices of cheddar cheese.

Since Randy bought 3 packages of Swiss cheese, each package has 28 slices, so Randy bought 28 * 3 = 84 slices of Swiss cheese.

Since we want to know the number of slices of each type in each package that Randy bought, we can conclude that Randy bought 12 slices of cheddar cheese and 28 slices of Swiss cheese.

However, we want to know the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought, so we can conclude that Randy bought 12 slices"

Since she wants to drink exactly 5 bottles each day, we can divide the total number of bottles (47) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (5).

47 ÷ 5 = 9.4

Since Bianca can't drink a fraction of a bottle, we round down to 9 days. This means the 47 bottles will last her for 9 days.

Now, let's calculate how many bottles she will have consumed in those 9 days:

9 days * 5 bottles/day = 45 bottles

This means she will have 47 - 45 = 2 bottles left over.

Since each pizza gets 2 pieces of pepperoni, we divide the total number of pepperoni pieces (11) by the number of pieces per pizza (2).

11 pieces / 2 pieces per pizza = 5.5 pizzas

Since we cannot make a fraction of a pizza, we round down to 5 pizzas, as the remaining pepperoni will not be enough to make another pizza.

For 5 pizzas, the total number of pepperoni pieces used is:
5 pizzas * 2 pieces per pizza = 10 pieces

Now, to find the extra pieces of pepperoni, we subtract the number of pieces used (10) from the total number of pieces available (11):

1. Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's age.
2. Philip is five years elder than Bryan.
3. The sum of the ages of the cousins is 40.

Let's denote Bryan's age as 'B'. Since Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's age, Pete's age can be written as B/3.

Philip is five years elder than Bryan, so Philip's age is B + 5.

The sum of their ages is 40, so we can write the equation:
B/3 + B + (B + 5) = 40

Combine like terms:
(1/3)B + B + B + 5 = 40
(1/3)B + 2B + 5 = 40

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
B + 6B + 15 = 120

Combine like terms:
7B + 15 = 120

Subtract 15 from both sides:
7B = 105

Divide both sides by 7:
B = 15

We know that Ana is 5 years more than Jack, so we can write an equation: 
A = J + 5.

We also know that the sum of their ages is 29, so we can write another equation: 
A + J = 29.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2J + 5 = 29.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 
2J = 24.

Divide both sides by 2: 
J = 12.

Now that we know Jack's age, we can find Ana's age by substituting J into the first equation: 
A = J + 5.
A = 12 + 5.
A = 17.

So, Jack is 12 years old and Ana is 17 years old.

Three years from now, Lewis' age will be L + 3 and Brown's age will be B + 3. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages three years from now will be 3:5, so we can set up the equation:

(L + 3) / (B + 3) = 3/5

We can substitute B = 2L into this equation:

(L + 3) / (2L + 3) = 3/5

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5(L + 3) = 3(2L + 3)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

5L + 15 = 6L + 9

Subtracting 5L from both sides gives:

15 = L + 9

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives:

6 = L

Now that we know L, we can find B:

B = 2L
= 2(6)
= 12

So, Lewis' present age is 6 and Brown's present age is 12.

Area = (1/2) × (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) × height

Given that the area of the trapezium is 84 Sq.cm and the height is 8 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula:

84 = (1/2) × (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) × 8

Now, let's simplify the equation:

84 = (1/2) × (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) × 8
84 = 4 × (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides)
84 / 4 = sum of the lengths of the parallel sides
21 = sum of the lengths of the parallel sides

1337,Mr. White purchased a carpet for rectangular hall of area 800 sq. yards. The length of the hall is 32 yards. Find the required width of the carpet.,"To find the required width of the carpet, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. We are given the area (800 sq. yards) and the length (32 yards), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the width.

Area = length * width
800 = 32 * width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 32.

width = 800 / 32
width = 25

Therefore, the required width of the carpet is 25 yards.

1338,"The area of right angled triangle is 32 sq. cm. If the base is 8 cm, find its height.","To find the height of the right-angled triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (base * height) / 2.

Given the area is 32 sq. cm and the base is 8 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula: 32 = (8 * height) / 2.

Now, we can solve for height by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2: 64 = 8 * height.

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate height: height = 64 / 8 = 8.

So, the height of the triangle is 8 cm.

1346,The angles of a triangle are in the ratio 1:2:3. Find each angle of the triangle.,"To find the angles of the triangle, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. 

Let's assume the angles are x, 2x, and 3x, since they are in the ratio 1:2:3.

We can set up an equation using the fact that the sum of the angles is 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60

3x = 3(30) = 90

So, the angles of the triangle are 30, 60, and 90 degrees.

1349,A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same. The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.,"To find the perimeter of the field, we need to add the perimeter of the rectangular region and the perimeter of the triangular region, but subtract the shared side between the rectangle and triangle since it's counted twice.

The perimeter of the rectangular region is the sum of all its sides. Given the length of the rectangle is 76 ft and the width is 42 ft (same as the side of the triangle), the perimeter of the rectangle is:
2 * (length + width) = 2 * (76 + 42) = 2 * 118 = 236 ft

The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is the sum of all its sides, which are equal. Given the side of the triangle is 42 ft, the perimeter of the triangle is:
3 * side = 3 * 42 = 126 ft

However, since one side of the triangle is shared with the rectangle, we need to subtract this shared side from the total perimeter of the triangle to avoid counting it twice:
126 ft - 42 ft = 84 ft

Now, we can add the perimeter of the rectangle and the adjusted perimeter of the triangle to find the total perimeter of the field:
236 ft + 84 ft = 320 ft

1408,A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,"To solve this problem, we will start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's use A for A's age, B for B's age, C for C's age, and D for D's age.

Since A is two years older than B, we can write an equation:

A = B + 2

We also know that D is twice as old as A and B combined. This can be expressed as:

D = 2(A + B)

Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:

D = 2(B + 2 + B)
D = 2(2B + 2)
D = 4B + 4

We are also given that B is twice as old as C, so we can write:

B = 2C

Now, we know that the ages of D and C differ by 40 years. This can be written as:

D - C = 40

Substituting the expressions for D and B, we get:

(4B + 4) - C = 40

Substituting B = 2C into this equation, we get:

(4(2C) + 4) - C = 40
8C + 4 - C = 40
7C = 36
C = 36/7
C = 5.14 (approximately), but since age must be a whole number, we will round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep it as a fraction for the sake of calculation.

Now that we know C, we can find B:

B = 2C
B = 2 * 36/7
B = 72/7
B = 10.29 (approximately), but since age must be a whole number, we will round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep it as a fraction for the sake of calculation.

Now that we know B, we can find A:

A = B + 2
A = 72/7 + 2
A = 72/7 + 14/7
A = 86/7
A = 12.29 (approximately), but since age must be a whole number, we will round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep it as a fraction for the sake of calculation.

Now that we know A, B, C, and D, we can find their values. However, we will only provide the ages of A and B as requested.

1409,"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son. Find the present ages of father and son.","Let's denote the son's age two years ago as 'x'. Since the father was five times as old as the son two years ago, the father's age two years ago would be 5x.

Now, let's calculate their current ages. Since two years have passed, we add 2 to both their ages. So, the son's current age would be x + 2, and the father's current age would be 5x + 2.

According to the problem, two years later (i.e., after adding 2 more years to their current ages), the father's age will be 8 more than the son's age. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

(5x + 2) + 2 = (x + 2) + 2 + 8

Simplifying the equation:

5x + 4 = x + 12

Subtracting x from both sides:

4x + 4 = 12

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

4x = 8

Dividing by 4:

x = 2

Now that we know the son's age two years ago (x = 2), we can find the son's current age:

Son's current age = x + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4

We also know the father's age two years ago (5x = 5 * 2 = 10), so we can find the father's current age:

Father's current age = 5x + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12

1410,Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the age of father.,"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let the age of the father be F and the ages of the two children be C1 and C2.

From the problem statement, we know that the father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. We can write this as an equation:

F = 3(C1 + C2)

Now, let's consider what happens after 5 years. The father's age will be F + 5, and the ages of the two children will be C1 + 5 and C2 + 5.

According to the problem statement, after 5 years, the father's age will be twice the sum of the ages of the two children. We can write this as an equation:

F + 5 = 2(C1 + 5 + C2 + 5)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

F + 5 = 2(C1 + C2 + 10)

F + 5 = 2C1 + 2C2 + 20

Now, we can substitute the expression for F from the first equation into this equation:

3(C1 + C2) + 5 = 2C1 + 2C2 + 20

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

3C1 + 3C2 + 5 = 2C1 + 2C2 + 20

Subtracting 2C1 and 2C2 from both sides, we get:

C1 + C2 + 5 = 20

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

C1 + C2 = 15

Now, we can substitute this expression into the first equation:

F = 3(C1 + C2)

F = 3(15)

F = 45

Therefore, the age of the father is 45.

1411,5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.,"To solve this problem, we will first define the present ages of the father and son as variables. Let's call the present age of the father 'F' and the present age of the son 'S'.

We are given two pieces of information about their ages:
1. Five years hence (in the future), the age of the father will be three times the age of his son.
2. Five years earlier (in the past), the age of the father was seven times the age of his son.

From the first piece of information, we can write an equation based on their ages five years from now:
(F + 5) = 3(S + 5)

From the second piece of information, we can write an equation based on their ages five years ago:
(F - 5) = 7(S - 5)

Now, we will solve these two equations to find the present ages of the father and the son.

First, let's simplify the equations:
1. F + 5 = 3S + 15
   F = 3S + 10

2. F - 5 = 7S - 35
   F = 7S - 30

Since both equations are equal to F, we can set them equal to each other:
3S + 10 = 7S - 30

Now, let's solve for S:
10 + 30 = 7S - 3S
40 = 4S
S = 10

Now that we know the son's age, we can find the father's age by substituting S into one of the original equations:
F = 3S + 10
F = 3(10) + 10
F = 30 + 10
F = 40

1412,The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children. After 15 years sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. Find the age of the father.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the age of the father be F.

Since the age of the father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children, let the sum of the ages of the children be F as well.

After 15 years, the age of the father will be F + 15.

The sum of the ages of the children after 15 years will be F + 15 * 5, since each child will have aged 15 years.

According to the problem, after 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. So, we can set up the equation:

F + 15 * 5 = 2(F + 15)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

F + 75 = 2F + 30

Subtracting F from both sides, we get:

75 = F + 30

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

45 = F

So, the age of the father is 45.

1416,The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the present age of the father be F and the present age of the son be S.

We are given that the sum of their present ages is 55 years, so we can write an equation:

F + S = 55

We are also given that if the father lives until his son's age equals his present age, the total of their ages would be 93 years. This means that the father will live for S years, and during this time, the son's age will increase by S years.

After S years, the father's age will be F + S, and the son's age will be S + S = 2S.

The total of their ages at that time will be F + S + 2S = 93.

We can simplify this equation to:

F + 3S = 93

Now we have two equations and two variables:

F + S = 55
F + 3S = 93

We can solve these equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(F + 3S) - (F + S) = 93 - 55
2S = 38
S = 19

Now that we have found the son's age, we can find the father's age by substituting S into one of the original equations:

F + S = 55
F + 19 = 55
F = 36

Therefore, the present age of the father is 36 years, and the present age of the son is 19 years.

1420,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.,"To solve this problem, let's denote the tens digit as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'. Therefore, the two-digit number can be represented as 10a + b.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The number is four times the sum of its digits, which can be expressed as:
   10a + b = 4(a + b)

2. The number is twice the product of the digits, which can be expressed as:
   10a + b = 2ab

We can start by solving the first equation:
10a + b = 4(a + b)
10a + b = 4a + 4b
10a - 4a = 4b - b
6a = 3b
2a = b

Now, we can substitute the value of 'b' from the above equation into the second equation:
10a + b = 2ab
10a + 2a = 2a(2a)
12a = 4a^2
4a^2 - 12a = 0
4a(a - 3) = 0

This gives us two possible values for 'a': a = 0 or a = 3. However, 'a' cannot be 0 since it's a two-digit number. Therefore, a = 3.

Now, we can find the value of 'b' using the equation 2a = b:
b = 2a
b = 2 * 3
b = 6

So, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10*3 + 6 = 36.

1421,"A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.","Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given a two-digit number, which we can represent as 10x + y, where x is the digit in the tens place and y is the digit in the ones place.

The number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits, so we can write an equation:

10x + y = 7(x + y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + y = 7x + 7y

Subtracting 7x from both sides gives:

3x + y = 7y

Subtracting y from both sides gives:

3x = 6y

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

x = 2y

Now, we are also given that when 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. This means that the new number is 10y + x.

We can write an equation based on this:

(10x + y) - 27 = 10y + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + y - 27 = 10y + x

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

9x + y - 27 = 10y

Subtracting y from both sides gives:

9x - 27 = 9y

Adding 27 to both sides gives:

9x = 9y + 27

Dividing both sides by 9 gives:

x = y + 3

Now we have two equations:

x = 2y
x = y + 3

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2y = y + 3

Subtracting y from both sides gives:

y = 3

Now that we have found y, we can find x:

x = 2y
x = 2(3)
x = 6

So, the number is 10x + y = 10(6) + 3 = 63.

1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.","Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given a two-digit number where the sum of the two digits is 9. Let's call the tens digit 'x' and the units digit 'y'. We can write an equation based on the given information:

x + y = 9

We are also told that if the digits are reversed, the number is increased by 9. This means that the new number is (10y + x) and it is equal to the original number (10x + y) plus 9. We can write an equation based on this:

10y + x = 10x + y + 9

Now, we can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

10y + x - y = 10x + 9

This simplifies to:

9y + x = 10x + 9

Now, we can subtract x from both sides:

9y = 9x + 9

Next, we can subtract 9 from both sides:

9y - 9 = 9x

This simplifies to:

9(y - 1) = 9x

Now, we can divide both sides by 9:

y - 1 = x

Now, we can add 1 to both sides:

y = x + 1

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

x + (x + 1) = 9

This simplifies to:

2x + 1 = 9

Now, we can subtract 1 from both sides:

2x = 8

Now, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 4

Now, we can find y by substituting x into the expression y = x + 1:

y = 4 + 1
y = 5

So, the original number is 10x + y = 10(4) + 5 = 45.

1423,The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that the sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 15. Let's call the number ""ab"", where ""a"" is the tens digit and ""b"" is the units digit. We know that a + b = 15.

We are also given that when the number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed. This means that the new number is ""ba"". We can set up an equation based on this:

10a + b - 27 = 10b + a

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9a - 9b = 27

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

a - b = 3

Now we have two equations:

a + b = 15
a - b = 3

Adding the two equations, we get:

2a = 18

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

a = 9

Substituting a = 9 into the first equation, we get:

9 + b = 15

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:

b = 6

So the original number is 96.

1424,"In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number.","Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given a two-digit number where the tens digit is three times the unit digit. Let's call the unit digit 'x'. Then, the tens digit is 3x.

The two-digit number can be represented as 10(3x) + x = 30x + x = 31x.

When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. This means the new number is 10x + 3x = 13x.

We know that the original number minus 54 is equal to the new number. We can set up an equation:

31x - 54 = 13x

Now, let's solve for x:

31x - 13x = 54
18x = 54
x = 54/18
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find the original number:

Original number = 31x

1429,"Points A and B are 70 km apart on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B at the same time. If they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours, but if they travel towards each other they meet in one hour. What are their respective speeds?","To solve this problem, we can start by using the concept of relative speed. When the two cars travel towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Let's denote the speed of the car starting from A as ""a"" and the speed of the car starting from B as ""b"". 

When they travel towards each other, they meet in 1 hour, covering a total distance of 70 km. We can set up the equation:

a + b = 70 / 1
a + b = 70

Now, when they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours. In this case, the relative speed is the difference between their individual speeds. The car starting from A covers a certain distance in 7 hours, and the car starting from B covers the remaining distance. We can set up the equation:

a - b = 70 / 7
a - b = 10

Now we have two equations:

a + b = 70
a - b = 10

We can add these two equations to eliminate b:

2a = 80
a = 40

Now we can substitute the value of a into one of the original equations to find b:

40 + b = 70
b = 30

So, the speed of the car starting from A is 40 km/h, and the speed of the car starting from B is 30 km/h.

Answer: [40, 30]"
1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"To find the time the car spent going uphill and downhill, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time.

Let's denote the time spent going uphill as ""t1"" and the time spent going downhill as ""t2"". We know that the total time is 15 hours, so t1 + t2 = 15.

We also know that the car covered a total distance of 650 km. Since the car goes uphill at 30 km/h and downhill at 50 km/h, we can set up the equation:

30t1 + 50t2 = 650

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve the first equation for t1:

t1 = 15 - t2

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

30(15 - t2) + 50t2 = 650

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

450 - 30t2 + 50t2 = 650

Combine like terms:

20t2 = 200

Divide by 20:

t2 = 10

Now that we have t2, we can find t1:

t1 = 15 - t2
= 15 - 10
= 5

So the car spent 5 hours going uphill and 10 hours going downhill.

Answer: [5 hours uphill, 10 hours downhill]"
1436,"Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of speed, distance, and time. Let's denote the speed of the train as 't' km/h and the speed of the bus as 'b' km/h.

When Ronnie travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus, the total time taken is 4 hours. We can write an equation using the formula: time = distance/speed.

Time taken to travel 60 km by train = 60/t
Time taken to travel the remaining distance (240 km) by bus = 240/b
Total time = 60/t + 240/b = 4

When Ronnie travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, the total time taken is 4 hours 10 minutes, which is equal to 4.17 hours (converting 10 minutes to hours). We can write another equation:

Time taken to travel 100 km by train = 100/t
Time taken to travel the remaining distance (200 km) by bus = 200/b
Total time = 100/t + 200/b = 4.17

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve these equations to find the values of 't' and 'b'.

First, let's simplify the equations:

60/t + 240/b = 4 ... (1)
100/t + 200/b = 4.17 ... (2)

We can multiply equation (1) by 5 and equation (2) by 6 to make the coefficients of 't' equal:

300/t + 1200/b = 20
600/t + 1200/b = 25.02

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(600/t - 300/t) + (1200/b - 1200/b) = 25.02 - 20
300/t = 5.02

Now, divide both sides by 300:

t = 300/5.02
t = 59.76 km/h (approximately)

Now that we have the value of 't', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'b'. Let's use equation (1):

60/t + 240/b = 4
60/59.76 + 240/b = 4

Multiply both sides by 59.76:

60 + 240*59.76/b = 4*59.76
60 + 14342.4/b = 239.04

Subtract 60 from both sides:

14342.4/b = 179.04

Now, divide both sides by 14342.4:

b = 14342.4/179.04
b = 80 km/h (approximately)

Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately 59.76 km/h, and the speed of the bus is approximately 80 km/h.

Answer: [The speed of the train is 59.76 km/h and the speed of the bus is 80 km/h.]"
1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of speed, time, and distance. Let's break it down step by step.

Let the original speed of the train be x km/hr, and the scheduled time be t hours. Then, the distance covered by the train is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time
= x × t

Now, if the train were 6 km/hr faster, its new speed would be (x + 6) km/hr. In this case, it would take 8 hours less than the scheduled time, so the new time would be (t - 8) hours. The distance remains the same, so we can set up the equation:

x × t = (x + 6) × (t - 8)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

xt = xt - 8x + 6t - 48
8x = 6t - 48
6t = 8x + 48

Now, if the train were 6 km/hr slower, its new speed would be (x - 6) km/hr. In this case, it would take 12 hours more than the scheduled time, so the new time would be (t + 12) hours. Again, the distance remains the same, so we can set up the equation:

x × t = (x - 6) × (t + 12)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

xt = xt + 12x - 6t - 72
12x = 6t + 72
6t = 12x - 72

Now, we have two equations:

6t = 8x + 48 ... (1)
6t = 12x - 72 ... (2)

Equating the two equations, we get:

8x + 48 = 12x - 72
4x = 120
x = 30

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find the value of t. Let's use equation (1):

6t = 8x + 48
6t = 8(30) + 48
6t = 240 + 48
6t = 288
t = 48

Now that we have the values of x and t, we can find the distance:

Distance = x × t
= 30 × 48
= 1440

Therefore, the length of the journey is 1440 km.

From the first purchase, we have 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. This gives us the equation:
7b + 6c = 3800

From the second purchase, we have 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. This gives us the equation:
3b + 5c = 1750

We can solve these two equations to find the values of 'b' and 'c'. 

First, let's multiply the second equation by 7 and the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of 'b' equal:
21b + 35c = 12250 (multiplied the second equation by 7)
21b + 18c = 11400 (multiplied the first equation by 3)

Now, subtract the second equation from the first:
(21b + 35c) - (21b + 18c) = 12250 - 11400
17c = 850

Now, divide by 17 to find 'c':
c = 850 / 17
c = 50

Now that we know 'c', we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find 'b'. Let's use the first equation:
7b + 6c = 3800
7b + 6(50) = 3800
7b + 300 = 3800

Now, subtract 300 from both sides:
7b = 3500

9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a)

Expanding the equation, we get:

90a + 9b = 20b + 2a

Rearranging the terms, we get:

Since the second angle is three times the first, the measure of the second angle is 3x.

The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first, so the measure of the third angle is 2x - 12.

We know that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

6x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

6x = 192

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 32

Now that we have the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the second and third angles:

Second angle: 3x = 3(32) = 96

Third angle: 2x - 12 = 2(32) - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52

So, the measures of the angles are 32, 96, and 52 degrees.

Answer: [32, 96, 52]"
1473,The perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width. Find the dimensions.,"To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter is 150 cm and the length is 15 cm greater than the width. Let's represent the width as w. Then, the length can be represented as w + 15.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

150 = 2(w + (w + 15))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

150 = 2(2w + 15)

150 = 4w + 30

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

120 = 4w

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

30 = w

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by adding 15 to the width:

l = w + 15
l = 30 + 15
l = 45

So, the dimensions of the rectangle are 30 cm (width) and 45 cm (length).

Answer: [30 cm, 45 cm]"
1474,The perimeter of a college basketball court is 96 meters and the length is 14 meters more than the width. What are the dimensions?,"To find the dimensions of the college basketball court, we need to use the information given about the perimeter and the relationship between the length and the width.

Let's denote the width as 'w' and the length as 'l'. We know that the length is 14 meters more than the width, so we can express the length in terms of the width as l = w + 14.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w). We are given that the perimeter is 96 meters, so we can set up the equation:

96 = 2(l + w)

Substituting l = w + 14 into the equation, we get:

96 = 2(w + 14 + w)

Combine like terms:

96 = 2(2w + 14)

Simplify:

96 = 4w + 28

Subtract 28 from both sides:

68 = 4w

Divide both sides by 4:

17 = w

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by adding 14:

l = w + 14
l = 17 + 14
l = 31

So, the dimensions of the college basketball court are a width of 17 meters and a length of 31 meters.

Answer: [17 meters x 31 meters]"
1475,"A mountain cabin on 1 acre of land costs $30,000. If the land cost 4 times as much as the cabin, what was the cost of each?","To find the cost of the cabin and the land, we need to set up an equation. Let's assume the cost of the cabin is x. Since the land costs 4 times as much as the cabin, the cost of the land is 4x.

We know that the total cost of the cabin and the land is $30,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 30,000

Combine like terms:

5x = 30,000

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6,000

So, the cost of the cabin is $6,000. Since the land costs 4 times as much as the cabin, the cost of the land is:

4x = 4 * 6,000 = 24,000

Therefore, the cost of the cabin is $6,000 and the cost of the land is $24,000.

Answer: {6,000, 24,000}"

We know that the total number of stamps they collected is 240. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 240

Combine like terms:

4x = 240

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 60

Since Harry's sister collected x stamps, she collected 60 stamps. Since Harry collected 3x stamps, he collected 3 * 60 = 180 stamps.

The answer is {Harry: 180, Sister: 60}."
1477,"If Mr. Brown and his son together had $220, and Mr. Brown had 10 times as much as his son, how much money had each?","Let's denote the amount of money Mr. Brown's son has as x. 
Since Mr. Brown has 10 times as much as his son, Mr. Brown has 10x.

Together, they have $220, so the sum of their money is x + 10x = 11x.

Since their total is $220, we can write the equation as 11x = 220.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 11, so x = 220 / 11 = 20.

This means Mr. Brown's son has $20.

Since Mr. Brown has 10 times as much as his son, Mr. Brown has 10 * $20 = $200.

The answer is {Mr. Brown has $200, and his son has $20}."
1483,An eight ft board is cut into two pieces. One piece is 2 ft longer than the other. How long are the pieces?,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x ft. Since the other piece is 2 ft longer, its length will be x + 2 ft.

We know that the total length of the board is 8 ft, and it's cut into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces should be equal to the total length of the board.

We can write an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 2) = 8

Combine like terms:

2x + 2 = 8

Subtract 2 from both sides:

2x = 6

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 3

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 3 ft, we can find the length of the longer piece by adding 2 ft:

x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 ft

So, the lengths of the two pieces are 3 ft and 5 ft.

1485,"The cost of a private pilot course is $1,275. The flight portion costs $625 more than the ground school portion. What is the cost of each?","To find the cost of each portion of the private pilot course, we can use the information given in the problem.

Let's denote the cost of the ground school portion as x. Since the flight portion costs $625 more than the ground school portion, the cost of the flight portion is x + $625.

We know that the total cost of the private pilot course is $1,275. This means that the sum of the costs of the ground school and flight portions is equal to the total cost:

x + (x + $625) = $1,275

Combine like terms:

2x + $625 = $1,275

Subtract $625 from both sides:

2x = $650

Divide both sides by 2:

x = $325

Now that we know the cost of the ground school portion, we can find the cost of the flight portion by adding $625:

x + $625 = $325 + $625 = $950

What is the length and the width of the lot?,"To find the length and width of the lot, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the width is twice the length, so we can write an equation based on this relationship: w = 2l.

We are also given that the perimeter is 60 feet, so we can set up the equation: 60 = 2l + 2w.

Substituting the expression for w (w = 2l) into the equation, we get: 60 = 2l + 2(2l).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 60 = 2l + 4l, which combines to 60 = 6l.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get: l = 10.

Now that we know the length, we can find the width by substituting l into the equation w = 2l: w = 2(10), which equals 20.

Therefore, the length of the lot is 10 feet and the width is 20 feet.

How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?,"To find the number of tiles Mrs. Garvey needs, we need to first find the area of the floor in square inches, then divide it by the area of each tile.

The floor measures 6 feet by 10 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the dimensions to inches by multiplying by 12:
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Now we can find the area of the floor in square inches:
Area of floor = length * width
= 72 inches * 120 inches

What is the area of the circle?,"To find the area of the circle, we first need to find the radius of the circle. Since the circle touches each side of the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.

Let's call the side length of the square 's'. The area of the square is given as 400 square inches, so we can set up the equation:

s^2 = 400

To find the side length 's', we take the square root of both sides:

s = √400
s = 20 inches

Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, the diameter is also 20 inches. The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so:

Radius = 20/2
Radius = 10 inches

Now that we have the radius, we can find the area of the circle using the formula:

1544,"Robin had seven hundred thirty-six photos to put into a photo album. If each page holds six photos, how many full pages will she have?","To determine the number of full pages Robin will have, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. 

Robin has 736 photos and each page holds 6 photos. 

The number of full pages can be found by dividing 736 by 6. 

736 / 6 = 122.666...

Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the whole number part, which is 122.

1545,"A container can hold four orange slices. If a company had three hundred twenty-nine orange slices to put into containers, how many more slices would they need to fill up the last container?","To determine how many more slices the company needs to fill up the last container, we need to first find out how many containers they can fill with the 329 orange slices they have.

Since each container can hold 4 orange slices, we divide the total number of slices by 4 to find the number of containers they can fill:

329 ÷ 4 = 82.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a container, this means they can fill 82 containers completely, and the last container will be partially filled. To find out how many slices they have in the last container, we multiply the number of containers they can fill by the number of slices each container can hold:

82 * 4 = 328

This means they have 328 slices in the 82 containers they can fill. To find out how many slices they have left for the last container, we subtract 328 from the total number of slices:

329 - 328 = 1

Since the last container can hold 4 slices, and they only have 1 slice left, they need 3 more slices to fill up the last container.

1546,"There are five hundred fifty-four students going to a trivia competition. If each school van can hold nine students, how many vans will they need?","To find the number of vans needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students each van can hold. 

There are 554 students in total and each van can hold 9 students.
So, the number of vans needed is 554 / 9.
554 divided by 9 is 61 with a remainder of 5.
However, since we can't have a fraction of a van, and the remainder of 5 means we still need to accommodate 5 more students, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the number of vans needed is 61 + 1 = 62.

1555,"An industrial machine can make three hundred sixty-one crayons a day. If each box of crayons has four crayons in it, how many full boxes does the machine make a day?","To find the number of full boxes of crayons the machine makes a day, we need to divide the total number of crayons it makes by the number of crayons in each box.

The machine makes 361 crayons a day.
Each box of crayons has 4 crayons in it.
So, the number of full boxes the machine makes a day is 361 / 4 = 90.25.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we consider only the whole number part, which is 90. This is because the remaining 0.25 (or 1 crayon) is not enough to fill another box.

The answer is {90}."
1556,"A clown needed two hundred twenty-seven balloons for a party he was going to, but the balloons only came in packs of two. How many packs of balloons would he need to buy?","To find the number of packs of balloons the clown needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of balloons he needs by the number of balloons in each pack.

The clown needs 227 balloons, and each pack has 2 balloons.

So, we divide 227 by 2.

227 / 2 = 113.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 114.

However, 114 packs would give the clown 228 balloons (114 * 2 = 228), which is more than he needs. To get exactly 227 balloons, the clown would need to buy 113 packs and then get one more balloon from somewhere else.

But since the problem doesn't mention the possibility of buying individual balloons, we can assume that the clown needs to buy 114 packs of balloons to have enough for the party.

Answer: {114}"
1557,A botanist picked six hundred one flowers. She wanted to put them into eight bouquets with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?,"To determine how many flowers the botanist should pick, we need to find the number of flowers that can be evenly divided into 8 bouquets.

The botanist currently has 601 flowers. To divide them evenly into 8 bouquets, we need to find the largest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 601.

We can divide 601 by 8 to get 75.125. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 75 flowers per bouquet.

To find the total number of flowers needed for 8 bouquets with 75 flowers each, we multiply 8 by 75, which gives us 600 flowers.

Since the botanist already has 601 flowers, which is more than the 600 needed, she doesn't need to pick more flowers. However, she will have 1 extra flower that won't fit into the 8 bouquets.

To make the number of flowers a multiple of 8, she should pick 7 more flowers to have a total of 608 flowers, which can be divided into 8 bouquets of 76 flowers each.

The carpenter bought 266 sinks, and each house needs 6 sinks. 

We can calculate the number of houses by dividing the total number of sinks by the number of sinks per house: 266 / 6 = 44.33. However, since we cannot build a fraction of a house, we will round down to the nearest whole number.

So, the carpenter can build 44 houses with the sinks he bought.

The total number of buckets required is 426. 
Each package has 8 buckets.

To find out the number of packages, we divide 426 by 8. 
426 / 8 = 53.25

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a package, we round up to the nearest whole number. 
However, in this case, we can buy 53 packages and have 2 buckets left to buy from another package.

Therefore, the movie theater will need to buy 54 packages to meet their requirement.

1560,"Vanessa had saved up eight hundred fifty-five quarters and decided to spend them on sodas. If it costs seven quarters for each soda from a soda machine, how many more quarters would she need to buy the final soda?","To find out how many sodas Vanessa can buy with the quarters she has, we need to divide the total number of quarters by the number of quarters needed for each soda.

Vanessa has 855 quarters.
Each soda costs 7 quarters.

So, the number of sodas she can buy is 855 / 7 = 122.14 (round down to 122 since you can't buy a fraction of a soda).

Since she can buy 122 sodas, she will need 122 * 7 = 854 quarters.

She has 855 quarters, so she has 855 - 854 = 1 quarter left.

However, she needs 7 quarters to buy the final soda. Therefore, she needs 7 - 1 = 6 more quarters to buy the final soda.

1564,"The roller coaster at the state fair costs six tickets per ride. If you had eight hundred sixty-eight tickets, how many tickets would you have left if you rode it as many times as you could?","To find out how many tickets you would have left, we need to determine how many times you can ride the roller coaster with 868 tickets, given that it costs 6 tickets per ride.

First, we divide the total number of tickets (868) by the cost per ride (6) to find out how many times you can ride the roller coaster: 868 ÷ 6 = 144.67.

Since you can't ride a fraction of a time, we take the whole number part, which is 144. This means you can ride the roller coaster 144 times.

Now, we need to find out how many tickets you spent: 144 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 864 tickets.

Finally, we subtract the tickets you spent from the total number of tickets you had initially: 868 - 864 = 4.

The answer is {4}."

462 gigs / 9 gigs per flash drive = 51.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a flash drive, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that we have enough storage space. 

So, we need 52 flash drives to store 462 gigs of data.

1567,"An industrial machine can make three hundred twenty-one crayons a day. If each box of crayons has seven crayons in it, how many full boxes does the machine make a day?","To find the number of full boxes the machine makes a day, we need to divide the total number of crayons it makes by the number of crayons in each box.

The machine makes 321 crayons a day.
Each box of crayons has 7 crayons.
To find the number of full boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons in each box.
So, 321 ÷ 7 = 45.86 (approximately), but since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll consider only the whole number part, which is 45.

However, we must check if there are any remaining crayons that are not enough to fill a box. 
To do this, we multiply 45 boxes by 7 crayons per box to find the total number of crayons in the full boxes.
45 * 7 = 315 crayons.
Now, we subtract this number from the total number of crayons the machine makes.
321 - 315 = 6 crayons left.
These 6 crayons are not enough to fill a box of 7 crayons.

Therefore, the machine makes 45 full boxes of crayons a day.

If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?","To determine how many uniforms the store owner should buy so each employee has the same number and there are no extras, we need to divide the total number of uniforms by the number of employees.

There are 927 uniforms and 2 employees. 

927 / 2 = 463.5 

Since we cannot have half a uniform, this means the store owner can give each employee 463 uniforms. 

463 * 2 = 926 

This means the store owner can give each employee 463 uniforms and will have 1 uniform left over (927 - 926 = 1).

To avoid having any extra uniforms, the store owner should buy 1 more uniform so he can give each employee 464 uniforms.

This means for every 5 red cars, there are 3 blue cars.

Given that there are 40 red cars, we can set up a proportion to find the number of blue cars. Let's denote the number of blue cars as x. Since the ratio of red to blue is 5:3, we can set up the following proportion:

5/3 = 40/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

5x = 40 * 3
5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 120 / 5
x = 24

Therefore, there are 24 blue cars in the parking lot.

1657,"A small school has 42 boys. If the ratio of boys to girls is 7:1, how many students are there total?","To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the number of girls first. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 7:1, we can set up a proportion to find the number of girls.

Let's say the number of girls is x. The ratio of boys to girls is 7:1, so the number of boys is 7 times the number of girls.

We know that the number of boys is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

7x = 42

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 42 / 7
x = 6

So, there are 6 girls in the school.

Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total students = 42 + 6
Total students = 48

We are given the ratio of white chocolate to dark chocolate, which is 4:3, and we know that 20 bars of white chocolate were sold.

First, we can set up a proportion using the ratio and the number of white chocolate bars sold. Let's say the number of dark chocolate bars sold is x.

We can write the proportion as:
4/3 = 20/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
4x = 3 * 20

If the ratio of songs he deleted to songs he kept was 10:3, how many songs did he originally have on his MP3 player?","To find out how many songs Kaleb originally had on his MP3 player, we need to use the ratio of songs he deleted to songs he kept. The ratio is 10:3, and we know he deleted 20 songs.

Let's assume the number of songs he kept is 3x. Since the ratio of deleted songs to kept songs is 10:3, the number of deleted songs is 10x. We are given that the number of deleted songs is 20.

We can set up the equation: 10x = 20

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 10: x = 20 / 10 = 2

Now that we know x is 2, we can find the number of songs he kept: 3x = 3 * 2 = 6

So, Kaleb kept 6 songs. To find the total number of songs he originally had, we add the number of deleted songs to the number of kept songs: 20 (deleted) + 6 (kept) = 26

We are told that Victor won 36 games. Since the ratio of games Victor won to games his friend won is 9:5, we can set up a proportion to find the number of games his friend won.

Let's denote the number of games Victor won as 9x and the number of games his friend won as 5x. We know that Victor won 36 games, so we can set up the equation:

9x = 36

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 36 / 9
x = 4

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of games Victor's friend won by multiplying 5x by 4:

5x = 5 * 4
5x = 20

Therefore, Victor's friend won 20 games.

This means for every 5 empty spaces, there are 4 taken spaces.

Since there are 35 empty spaces, we can divide this number by 5 to find the multiplier for the ratio. 

35 / 5 = 7

Now, we multiply both parts of the ratio by 7 to find the actual number of empty and taken spaces.

Empty spaces: 5 * 7 = 35
Taken spaces: 4 * 7 = 28

To find the total number of spaces, we add the number of empty spaces to the number of taken spaces.

1677,"A produce store sold 32 red apples. If the ratio of red apples to green apples sold was 8:3, what is the combined amount of red and green apples sold?","To find the combined amount of red and green apples sold, we first need to determine the number of green apples sold. Since the ratio of red apples to green apples sold was 8:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of green apples.

Let's start by identifying the number of parts in the ratio: 8 parts red apples and 3 parts green apples, for a total of 8 + 3 = 11 parts.

We know that 32 red apples represent 8 parts, so we can set up a proportion to find the value of 1 part:

32 red apples / 8 parts = x green apples / 3 parts

To find the value of 1 part, we can divide 32 by 8:

32 ÷ 8 = 4

So, 1 part is equal to 4 apples.

Now, we can multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts for green apples (3) to find the number of green apples:

3 parts × 4 apples/part = 12 green apples

Now that we know the number of green apples sold (12), we can add it to the number of red apples sold (32) to find the combined amount:

32 red apples + 12 green apples = 44 apples

We are given that 72 shoes were sold. To find the number of sandals sold, we need to find the multiplier used to get from 9 shoes to 72 shoes. 

We can set up a proportion to find this multiplier: 9x = 72, where x is the multiplier. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 72 / 9 = 8.

Now that we know the multiplier is 8, we can multiply the number of sandals in the ratio (5) by this multiplier to find the number of sandals sold: 5 * 8 = 40.

Therefore, the number of sandals sold is 40.

This means for every 10 ounces of sugar, we need 1 ounce of flour.

Given that we used 50 ounces of sugar, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of flour needed. Since the ratio is 10:1, we can divide the amount of sugar by 10 to find the multiplier, then multiply this by 1 (the amount of flour in the ratio).

50 ounces of sugar / 10 = 5 (multiplier)
5 * 1 (amount of flour in the ratio) = 5 ounces of flour

However, the ratio is 10:1, so for every 10 ounces of sugar, we need 1 ounce of flour. To find the amount of flour for 50 ounces of sugar, we can divide 50 by 10 and then multiply by 1.

50 / 10 = 5
5 * 1 = 5 ounces of flour

But since the ratio is 10:1, we should actually multiply the 5 by 1, but the 1 is actually the amount of flour for 10 ounces of sugar, so we actually need 5 ounces of flour for 50 ounces of sugar.

This is because the snack bags should be identical and have no food left over.

The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. 
The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

The greatest common factor of 6 and 10 is 2. This means Serena can make 2 identical snack bags with each type of food, without any food left over.

Since 6 / 2 = 3 and 10 / 2 = 5, Serena can make 2 identical snack bags with 3 granola bars and 5 pieces of dried fruit in each bag.

However, the question asks for the greatest number of snack bags. We can see that Serena can also make 5 identical snack bags with 1 granola bar and 2 pieces of dried fruit in each bag, or 6 identical snack bags with 1 granola bar and 1.67 pieces of dried fruit in each bag (but she can't make a fraction of a snack bag).

She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are left over. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?","To find the greatest number of scrapbook pages Aylin can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of photos (18) and the number of newspaper clippings (20). This is because the GCD represents the largest number of items that can be evenly divided into both the number of photos and the number of newspaper clippings.

The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

The greatest common factor between 18 and 20 is 2.

This means that Aylin can create 2 photos and 2 newspaper clippings per page, or any other combination that is a multiple of 2. However, since she wants to use the greatest number of items per page, we will divide the total number of items by the GCD.

Number of pages with photos = 18 / 2 = 9
Number of pages with newspaper clippings = 20 / 2 = 10

However, these are not the same, so we should find the GCD of the two numbers, which is 2, and divide both numbers by this GCD. 

Number of pages with photos = 18 / 2 = 9
Number of pages with newspaper clippings = 20 / 2 = 10

Since 9 is less than 10, Aylin can create 9 pages with 2 photos and 2 newspaper clippings per page, and she will have 2 newspaper clippings left over. However, since she doesn't want any items left over, the greatest number of pages she can create with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page is the GCD of 18 and 20, which is 2. 

Number of pages with photos = 18 / 2 = 9
Number of pages with newspaper clippings = 20 / 2 = 10

However, these are not the same, so the greatest number of pages that Aylin can create with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page is the GCD of 9 and 10.

At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?","To find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9.

Since Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, the total number of pins he knocks down must be a multiple of 8. Similarly, since Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl, the total number of pins he knocks down must be a multiple of 9.

The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, ...
The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, ...

As we can see, the least common multiple of 8 and 9 is 72. This means that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down 72 pins.

However, we need to check if this is possible. If Sam knocks down 72 pins, he must have bowled 72 / 8 = 9 times. If Carlos knocks down 72 pins, he must have bowled 72 / 9 = 8 times.

Since Sam and Carlos can bowl a different number of times, this is possible. Therefore, the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is indeed 72.

We can start by finding the factors of each number. The factors of 86 are 1, 2, 43, and 86. The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.

The greatest common factor of 86 and 42 is 2. However, we also need to consider the number of cookies in each package. Since we want to use all the cookies, the number of cookies in each package must be a factor of both 86 and 42.

Let's try dividing both numbers by 2: 86 ÷ 2 = 43 and 42 ÷ 2 = 21. This means we can put 43 chocolate chip cookies and 21 sugar cookies in each package, but this would not be the greatest number of packages.

However, we can divide both numbers by 2 again: 43 ÷ 2 is not a whole number, but 21 ÷ 2 is not a factor of 86. We can try dividing 86 by other factors, but we find that 86 is not divisible by 3, 6, 7, or 14.

However, 86 is divisible by 2, and 42 is divisible by 2 and other numbers. We can try dividing both numbers by the greatest common factor of 2, but we already did that.

Let's try to find the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 using another method. We can list the multiples of 2 (the greatest common factor) until we find the greatest common multiple that is less than or equal to both 86 and 42.

The multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42.

We see that 42 is a multiple of 2, but 86 is not a multiple of 42. However, 86 is a multiple of 2, and we can divide 86 by 2 to get 43.

Now, let's divide 42 by 2 to get 21, and then divide 21 by 3 to get 7. We can see that 7 is a factor of 42, but not of 86.

However, we can try dividing 86 by other numbers. We see that 86 is divisible by 43, but 42 is not divisible by 43.

Let's try to find the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 using another method. We can list the factors of 86 and 42, and then find the greatest common factor.

We already listed the factors of 86 and 42. The greatest common factor of 86 and 42 is 2.

Now, let's divide both numbers by the greatest common factor of 2: 86 ÷ 2 = 43 and 42 ÷ 2 = 21.

We can see that 43 is a prime number, and 21 is not a multiple of 43. However, 21 is a multiple of 3 and 7.

We can try dividing 86 by 3, but 86 is not divisible by 3. We can try dividing 86 by 7, but 86 is not divisible by 7.

However, we can see that 42 is divisible by 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, and 21. We can try dividing 86 by these numbers, but we already did that.

Let's try to find the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 using another method. We can use the Euclidean algorithm.

We can start by dividing 86 by 42: 86 = 2 * 42 + 2.

Then, we can divide 42 by 2: 42 = 21 * 2 + 0.

We can see that the remainder is 0, so the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 is 2.

Now, let's divide both numbers by the greatest common factor of 2: 86 ÷ 2 = 43 and 42 ÷ 2 = 21.

We can see that 43 is a prime number, and 21 is not a multiple of 43. However, 21 is a multiple of 3 and 7.

We can try dividing 86 by 3, but 86 is not divisible by 3. We can try dividing 86 by 7, but 86 is not divisible by 7.

If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?","To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 17, since both the ducks and cranes are traveling in flocks of these sizes.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. In this case, the LCM of 13 and 17 is 221, since 13 * 17 = 221.

However, we are looking for the smallest number of ducks, not the total number of birds. Since the total number of ducks and cranes is the same, and they are traveling in flocks of 13 and 17, respectively, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is the LCM of 13 and 17 divided by 13.

So, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is 221 / 13 = 17.

However, this is not correct, since 17 is the number of cranes, not ducks. We are looking for the smallest multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 17. In this case, the smallest multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 17 is 221 / 17 = 13.

So, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is 13 * 17 / 17 = 13.

2242,"A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?","To find out how long it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed and then multiply that by the time it takes to install each window.

The building needs 14 windows in total, and the builder has already installed 5. To find out how many windows are left, we subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number needed:

14 (total windows needed) - 5 (windows already installed) = 9 windows left to be installed

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we multiply the number of windows left by the time it takes to install each one:

9 (windows left) * 4 (hours per window) = 36 hours

The answer is {36}."
2244,"In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?","To find the points earned, we need to determine the number of enemies defeated.

Since there are 12 boxes per case, we divide 31 boxes by 12.

31 ÷ 12 = 2 with a remainder of 7.

This means that Deborah can pack 2 full cases with 24 boxes (2 * 12 = 24), but there are 7 boxes left that cannot be packed into a full case.

So, the number of boxes that will not be packed to a case is 7.

Answer: {7}"
2264,"Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?","To find the number of cases of 12 boxes and extra boxes Nancy needs, we first divide the total number of boxes (45) by the number of boxes per case (12).

45 boxes / 12 boxes per case = 3.75 cases

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we take the whole number part (3) as the number of full cases.

3 cases * 12 boxes per case = 36 boxes

Now, we subtract the number of boxes in the full cases from the total number of boxes to find the extra boxes:

45 boxes - 36 boxes = 9 boxes

So, Nancy needs 3 cases of 12 boxes and 9 extra boxes.

Answer: {3 cases and 9 extra boxes}"

2266,"Sean had 45 Starbursts. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?","To find out how many Starbursts each person got, we first need to find out how many Starbursts were left after Sean gave some to his friends and ate the rest. However, the problem does not provide information about how many Starbursts Sean ate. It only mentions that he gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then ate what was left.

We can start by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say the number of Starbursts each friend got is x. Since Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends, the total number of Starbursts given away is 18x.

We know that Sean started with 45 Starbursts. If he gave away 18x Starbursts, then he ate the rest, which is 45 - 18x.

Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact number of Starbursts each person got without knowing how many Starbursts Sean ate. However, we can express the number of Starbursts each person got in terms of the total number of Starbursts.

If Sean gave away all the Starbursts and did not eat any, then the total number of Starbursts given away would be 45, and each person would get 45 / 18 = 2.5 Starbursts.

However, since Sean ate some Starbursts, the actual number of Starbursts each person got would be less than 2.5.

To solve this problem, we need more information about how many Starbursts Sean ate.

149,Mrs. Hilt spent 1 hour and 30 minutes shoveling snow on Saturday morning and 45 minutes shoveling snow on Saturday afternoon. How much total time did she spend shoveling snow?,"To find the total time Mrs. Hilt spent shoveling snow, we need to add the time she spent shoveling snow on Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon.

First, let's convert the time spent shoveling snow on Saturday morning into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

On Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Hilt spent 45 minutes shoveling snow.

If the first team made 235, and the second made 275, how many pies should the third team make?","To find out how many pies the third team should make, we need to first determine the total number of pies made by the first two teams, and then subtract that from the total number of pies needed.

The first team made 235 pies and the second team made 275 pies. 
So, the total number of pies made by the first two teams is 235 + 275 = 510 pies.

Since Janine needs a total of 750 mini meat pies, the third team should make 750 - 510 = 240 pies.

And the first team cooked 75 plates less than what the second and third team made, how many steaks did they cook altogether?","To find the total number of steaks cooked, we need to find out how many steaks the first team cooked and then add the number of steaks cooked by the second and third teams.

We know that the second and third teams cooked 240 plates of steak. The first team cooked 75 plates less than the second and third teams combined. So, the first team cooked 240 - 75 = 165 plates of steak.

Now, we can find the total number of steaks cooked by adding the number of steaks cooked by all three teams. 
Total number of steaks cooked = 165 (first team) + 240 (second and third teams) = 405.

If he has 46 feet of rope with him and at the moment he only needed 57 feet, how many feet of rope did his friends give to him?","To find out how many feet of rope his friends gave to him, we need to first calculate the total amount of rope he will need. We already know that he needs 185 feet of rope in total. 

He has 46 feet of rope with him and he used 57 feet at the moment. However, the 57 feet he used is part of the rope he has or the rope his friends gave to him. So, the total amount of rope he has or his friends gave to him is the amount he has (46 feet) plus the amount his friends gave to him, which is unknown for now. 

Let's denote the amount of rope his friends gave to him as x. So, the total amount of rope he has or his friends gave to him is 46 + x. 

We know that he used 57 feet of rope from this total amount. So, the amount of rope left is (46 + x) - 57. 

However, we also know that he will need 185 feet of rope in total. So, the amount of rope left after using 57 feet should be 185 - 57 = 128 feet. 

Now we can equate the amount of rope left to 128 feet: (46 + x) - 57 = 128.

We can solve for x: 46 + x - 57 = 128.
x - 11 = 128.
x = 139.

So, his friends gave to him 139 feet of rope.

If Lizzie's group covered 250 square feet of land and the other group covered 265, how many more square feet of land remains to be cleaned if there is total of 900 square feet of land?","To find the total area covered by both groups, we need to add the area covered by Lizzie's group and the other group. 

Lizzie's group covered 250 square feet of land.
The other group covered 265 square feet of land.
The total area covered by both groups is 250 + 265 = 515 square feet.

Now, we know that there is a total of 900 square feet of land. To find the area that remains to be cleaned, we need to subtract the area already covered from the total area.

The area that remains to be cleaned is 900 - 515 = 385 square feet.

The total amount spent is $560.00.
The amount spent on food is $268.00.
The amount spent on utensils and other stuff is $118.00.

We can find the amount spent on drinks by subtracting the amount spent on food and utensils from the total amount spent.
Amount spent on drinks = Total amount spent - (Amount spent on food + Amount spent on utensils)
Amount spent on drinks = $560.00 - ($268.00 + $118.00)

The total distance to the island is 436 miles.
The plane made 2 stopovers, the 1st stopover after 132 miles and the 2nd stopover after another 236 miles.
So, the distance covered by the 2nd stopover is 132 + 236 = 368 miles.
Now we need to find the distance from the 2nd stopover to the island.
This distance will be the total distance to the island minus the distance covered by the 2nd stopover.

However, let's assume that the $650 donation happened before she bought the bagels, or that the $650 was from a different source of money. In that case, we can proceed with the problem.

We know that Olivia donated a total of $650 to the three orphanages. We also know that she donated $175 to the first orphanage and $250 to the third orphanage. To find out how much she donated to the second orphanage, we can subtract the amounts donated to the first and third orphanages from the total amount donated.

If the carrots were served equally to 12 people, how many carrot sticks were left uneaten?","To find out how many carrot sticks were left uneaten, we first need to find out how many carrot sticks each person got. Since the carrots were served equally to 12 people, we divide the total number of carrot sticks by the number of people.

Total carrot sticks = 74
Number of people = 12

Carrot sticks per person = Total carrot sticks / Number of people
= 74 / 12
= 6.17 (round down to 6 since you can't serve a fraction of a carrot stick)

So each person got 6 carrot sticks.

Total carrot sticks eaten = Number of people * Carrot sticks per person
= 12 * 6
= 72

To find out how many matchboxes each house will get, we need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.
So, we need to divide 119 by 9.
119 / 9 = 13.22, but we can't distribute a fraction of a matchbox, so we need to round down to 13, since we can't give a house more matchboxes than are available.
However, we also need to account for the remaining matchboxes that can't be evenly distributed.
119 - 9 * 13 = 2, so 2 matchboxes will be left over.

17 croissants / 7 guests = 2.4285714 (but we can't divide a croissant into fractions, so we'll round down to 2 croissants per guest, with 3 left over).

Since we can't divide the remaining 3 croissants equally among the 7 guests, we can either keep them aside or give 1 extra to 3 of the guests.

However, to provide a simple answer to the question, we can say that each guest will have at least 2 croissants, and then the remaining 3 can be distributed as desired.

510,"Drew prepared 61 servings of butterscotch. If she expects her 6 sweet-tooth guests to share the butterscotch among them equally, how many will be left unconsumed?","To find out how many servings of butterscotch will be left unconsumed, we need to first determine how many servings each guest will get. 

Since Drew expects her 6 sweet-tooth guests to share the butterscotch among them equally, we will divide the total number of servings by the number of guests. 

So, each guest will get 61 / 6 = 10.17 servings of butterscotch. Since the guests cannot share a fraction of a serving, we will round down to 10 servings per guest.

Now, we will multiply the number of servings per guest by the number of guests to find the total number of servings consumed.

How much more money does Ulrich need to buy the jump rope, the game, and the ball?","To find out how much more money Ulrich needs, we first need to find out how much money he has in total. 
He has saved $7 from his allowance, and his uncle gave him $15.
So, he has $7 + $15 = $22.
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy.
The jump rope costs $9, the board game costs $9, and the playground ball costs $5.
So, the total cost is $9 + $9 + $5 = $23.
Now, we subtract the amount of money he has from the total cost to find out how much more money he needs.
$23 - $22 = $1.

668,"An airplane hangar is 300 feet long. How many planes can fit into it, end to end, if each plane is 40 feet long?","To find out how many planes can fit into the airplane hangar, we need to divide the total length of the hangar by the length of each plane.

The length of the airplane hangar is 300 feet, and each plane is 40 feet long.

So, we will divide 300 by 40 to find out how many planes can fit.

300 / 40 = 7.5

Since we cannot have half a plane, we will round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, 7 planes can fit into the airplane hangar, end to end.

670,105 people are going to a movie. 6 people can ride in each car. How many cars are needed to get all 105 people to the movie?,"To find out how many cars are needed to get all 105 people to the movie, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people each car can hold.

We know that 6 people can ride in each car. So, we divide the total number of people (105) by the number of people each car can hold (6).

105 ÷ 6 = 17.5

Since we can't have half a car, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to make sure all 105 people can fit. However, in this case, we can't fit the remaining 3 people in the 17 cars (6 * 17 = 102), so we will need one more car for the remaining 3 people.

So, the total number of cars needed is 18.

673,19 children take a minibus to the zoo. They are to sit 2 or 3 to a seat. There are 7 seats. How many seats will have 3 children seated on them?,"To find out how many seats will have 3 children seated on them, we need to first determine the total number of children that can be seated in 7 seats with 2 or 3 children per seat. 

Since we want to maximize the number of seats with 3 children, we'll assume all seats have 3 children until we run out of children. 

If all 7 seats had 3 children, the total number of children would be 7 * 3 = 21. However, we only have 19 children. 

So, we can fill 6 seats with 3 children each (6 * 3 = 18 children) and the remaining seat will have 1 child left (19 - 18 = 1 child) but since a seat must have 2 or 3 children, we'll have to take one child from one of the 6 seats with 3 children and put it in the last seat, making it a 2-child seat.

Therefore, the number of seats with 3 children will be 6 - 1 = 5 seats with 3 children and 1 seat with 2 children and 1 seat with 3 children is reduced to 2 children so another seat is increased to 3 children from 2 children, so we have 6 - 1 + 1 = 6 seats.

However, we have to consider the fact that we cannot have a fraction of a seat, so we will have 6 seats but one of those seats will have 2 children and the other 5 will have 3 children but the question asks how many seats will have 3 children seated on them, so the answer is 6 - 1 = 5 seats but since we have to consider one more seat will have 3 children, the answer is 5 + 1 = 6 - 1 + 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

But we have 6 seats but one of those seats will have 2 children so the answer is 6 - 1 = 5.

674,"Many families serve each person in the family one 6-ounce glass of orange juice each morning. If they buy orange juice by the gallon, how many whole servings of juice will they get out of one gallon (one gallon = 4 quarts, 1 quart = 32 ounces) of juice?","To find the number of whole servings of juice in a gallon, we need to first convert the gallon to ounces. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, and 1 quart is equal to 32 ounces. So, we can calculate the total number of ounces in a gallon as follows:

1 gallon = 4 quarts
1 quart = 32 ounces
So, 1 gallon = 4 quarts * 32 ounces/quart = 128 ounces

Now, we know that each serving is 6 ounces. To find the number of whole servings, we can divide the total number of ounces in a gallon by the number of ounces in each serving:

128 ounces / 6 ounces/serving = 21.33 servings

Since we can't have a fraction of a serving, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of whole servings of juice in a gallon is 21.

675,A company donates 935 pencils to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among 9 classrooms. The rest of the pencils are given to the library. How many pencils were donated to the library?,"To find the number of pencils donated to the library, we first need to divide the total number of pencils (935) by the number of classrooms (9). This will give us the number of pencils each classroom received. We can use the division operation for this.

935 ÷ 9 = 103.89 (approximately)

Since we cannot divide pencils into fractions, we will round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many pencils each classroom received.

935 ÷ 9 = 103 (pencils per classroom, rounded down)

Now, we can multiply the number of classrooms (9) by the number of pencils each classroom received (103) to find the total number of pencils given to the classrooms.

9 * 103 = 927

This means that 927 pencils were given to the classrooms. To find the number of pencils donated to the library, we subtract the number of pencils given to the classrooms from the total number of pencils.

935 - 927 = 8

So, the number of pencils donated to the library is 8.

Answer: {8}"

935 ÷ 9 = 103.888... (This is the number of pencils each classroom gets, but since we can't divide pencils into fractions, we round down to 103 pencils per classroom.)

Now, we multiply the number of classrooms by the number of pencils each classroom gets:
9 * 103 = 927

This means 927 pencils were given to the classrooms. To find out how many pencils were donated to the library, we subtract the number of pencils given to the classrooms from the total number of pencils:
935 - 927 = 8

Then 3 boys left, so now there are 5 - 3 = 2 boys.
Since the number of girls didn't change yet, there are still 4 girls.
So now there are 2 boys + 4 girls = 6 children.
Then 2 more girls arrived, so now there are 4 + 2 = 6 girls.

To find out how many passengers were there at first, we need to reverse the process.
Let's start with the 26 passengers in the bus after the stop.
Since 9 passengers got off, we need to add them back to get the number of passengers before they got off.

Antonia has 79 Barbie Dolls in total.
There are 35 Barbie Dolls in the first wardrobe.

We can find out the number of Barbie Dolls in the second wardrobe by subtracting the number of Barbie Dolls in the first wardrobe from the total number of Barbie Dolls.
The number of Barbie Dolls in the second wardrobe is 79 - 35 = 44.

Now, to find out how many more Barbie Dolls are in the second wardrobe than the first, we need to subtract the number of Barbie Dolls in the first wardrobe from the number of Barbie Dolls in the second wardrobe.
There are 44 - 35 = 9 more Barbie Dolls in the second wardrobe than the first.

760,"Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged, how many vases of flowers will she arrange on the last day?","To find the number of vases Jane will arrange on the last day, we need to divide the total number of vases by the number of vases she can arrange in a day.

Jane can arrange 16 vases in a day. There are 248 vases to be arranged. 

We divide 248 by 16 to find the number of days it will take her to arrange all the vases: 248 / 16 = 15.5 days.

Since she can't arrange a fraction of a day's worth of vases, this means she will arrange 16 vases per day for 15 days, and then arrange the remaining vases on the 16th day.

To find the number of vases she will arrange on the last day, we multiply the number of days she can arrange a full day's worth of vases (15 days) by the number of vases she can arrange in a day (16 vases): 15 * 16 = 240 vases.

766,"A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?","To find the number of passengers on the bus that is not fully occupied, we need to divide the total number of students and teachers going on the field trip by the number of passengers the bus can transport.

First, we divide the total number of students and teachers (1,230) by the number of passengers the bus can transport (48).

1,230 ÷ 48 = 25.625

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round down to the nearest whole number. This means the school will need 25 buses to transport all the students and teachers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of passengers that can be transported by 25 buses:

25 buses * 48 passengers/bus = 1,200 passengers

However, the question asks for the number of passengers on the bus that is not fully occupied. Since 1,230 students and teachers are going on the field trip, and 25 buses can transport 1,200 passengers, the remaining 30 students and teachers will be on the 26th bus, which is not fully occupied.

The number of passengers on the 26th bus is 1,230 - 1,200 = 30.

86 students / 9 students per bus = 9.55 buses

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round down to 9 buses (because we can't take a fraction of a bus, and the extra students will be left behind).

Now, we multiply the number of buses by the number of students each bus can take to find out how many students the buses can take in total.

9 buses * 9 students per bus = 81 students

When we divide 39 by 7, we get 5.57. However, since we can't have a fraction of a balloon, we'll round down to 5 balloons per group, but that would leave some balloons left over. 

To find out how many balloons are left over, we can multiply the number of groups (7) by the number of balloons per group (5), which gives us 7 * 5 = 35 balloons. 

Now, we subtract the number of balloons we've already grouped (35) from the total number of balloons (39), which gives us 39 - 35 = 4 balloons left over.

Since we can't leave any balloons out, we'll distribute the 4 leftover balloons among the 7 groups. However, since we want equal groups, we'll have to settle for an approximate equal number of balloons per group. 

In this case, the best we can do is have 5 balloons in some groups and 6 balloons in others. However, since the question asks for the number of balloons in each group, we'll provide the approximate equal number of balloons per group, which is the result of the division.

Let's first consider the large rooms, which can hold 3 people each. If we rent x large rooms, we can accommodate 3x people.

Since 26 is not exactly divisible by 3, we can try different values of x to see which one gets us closest to 26.

If x = 8, then 3x = 24, which is close to 26 but leaves 2 people unaccounted for. We can accommodate these 2 people in a small room.

650 lollipops / 42 kids = 15.476 (approximately)

Since we can't divide lollipops into fractions, each kid can have 15 lollipops. 

To find the total number of lollipops the kids will have, we multiply the number of kids by the number of lollipops each kid will have.

42 kids * 15 lollipops/kid = 630 lollipops

Now, we subtract the total number of lollipops the kids will have from the total number of lollipops available to find the number of lollipops left over or the number of lollipops needed for the kids to have one more each.

650 lollipops - 630 lollipops = 20 lollipops

However, since we want to find the minimum number of lollipops needed for each kid to have at least one more, we need to distribute one more lollipop to each kid. 

Since we have 20 lollipops left over and we need 42 lollipops to give one more to each kid, we subtract the number of lollipops we have from the number of lollipops we need.

Since she wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts, we will divide the total number of tarts she has (85) by the number of boxes (10).

85 ÷ 10 = 8.5

This means she can put 8 tarts in each box (since we can't have a fraction of a tart), and she will have some tarts left over. To find out how many tarts she will have left over, we multiply the number of tarts per box (8) by the number of boxes (10), then subtract that from the total number of tarts she has.

8 * 10 = 80
85 - 80 = 5

This means she will have 5 tarts left over. Since she wants to fill each box with the same number of tarts, and she can only put 8 tarts in each box, she will have to make more tarts to fill the boxes evenly. To find out how many more tarts she needs to make, we subtract the number of tarts she has (85) from the number of tarts she needs to fill the boxes (10 * 9 = 90, because 9 is the next whole number of tarts per box).

90 - 85 = 5

However, this is the number of tarts she needs to fill the boxes with 9 tarts each. Since she can only put 8 tarts in each box with the tarts she has, we will calculate how many more tarts she needs to put 9 tarts in each box.

10 * 9 = 90
10 * 8 = 80
90 - 80 = 10

However, we calculated earlier that she only needs 5 more tarts to fill the boxes with 9 tarts each. This is because she already has 85 tarts and only needs 90 to fill the boxes with 9 tarts each.

818,"A company buys 88 bureaus for 14 offices. If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, how many more bureaus are needed at least?","To find out how many bureaus each office should get, we need to divide the total number of bureaus (88) by the number of offices (14).

88 bureaus / 14 offices = 6.29 bureaus per office

Since we can't have a fraction of a bureau, each office should get at least 6 bureaus. However, 6 * 14 = 84 bureaus, which is less than the total number of bureaus the company has (88). 

So, to find out how many more bureaus are needed at least, we need to calculate how many bureaus are left after each office gets 6 bureaus.

88 - 84 = 4 bureaus are left.

However, the question asks for the number of bureaus needed at least, which means we need to find out how many more bureaus are needed so that each office can get at least 7 bureaus (the next whole number).

14 offices * 7 bureaus per office = 98 bureaus

The company currently has 88 bureaus, so they need at least:

98 - 88 = 10 more bureaus.

819,"Betty has 367 beads and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?","To find out how many beads Betty needs for each necklace, we need to divide the total number of beads she has by the number of necklaces she wants to make. 

She has 367 beads and wants to make 15 necklaces. 
367 / 15 = 24.47 

Since she can't have a fraction of a bead, she can make 15 necklaces with 24 beads each. 
24 * 15 = 360 

Now, she wants to use all the beads, so she needs to make sure she has enough beads to make 15 necklaces with the same number of beads. 
She already has 367 beads, but she needs to make 15 necklaces with 25 beads each to use more than 367 beads. 
25 * 15 = 375 

She needs 375 beads to make 15 necklaces with 25 beads each. 
She only has 367 beads, so she needs 375 - 367 = 8 more beads.

820,"There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?","To find the minimum number of pudding cups each student can get, we divide the total number of cups (315) by the number of students (218). 

315 ÷ 218 = 1.445 (approximately), but since the students can't have a fraction of a cup, we round down to 1 cup per student as the minimum. However, to ensure each student gets an equal number of cups, we should round up to the nearest whole number. 

Let's try rounding up to 2 cups per student: 
2 * 218 = 436 cups

Since we need 436 cups for each student to get 2 cups, but we only have 315 cups, we need to find the difference.

436 (required cups) - 315 (available cups) = 121 cups

The answer is {121}."
821,"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?","To find out how many more riddles Sam needs to distribute, we first need to find out how many riddles each student will get if the riddles are distributed evenly.

We start with 389 riddles.
There are 18 students.
389 / 18 = 21.6111 (we can't distribute a fraction of a riddle, so we need to round up).
To distribute the riddles evenly, each student needs to get at least 22 riddles.
Since there are 18 students, the total number of riddles needed is 18 * 22 = 396.
We already have 389 riddles.
So the number of riddles Sam needs to distribute is 396 - 389 = 7.

822,"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?","To determine how many chairs each classroom will get, we need to divide the total number of chairs (1,093) by the number of classrooms (35).

1,093 ÷ 35 = 31.23

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a chair, we will round down to 31 chairs per classroom. 

Now, we need to find out how many chairs the school has in total if each classroom gets 31 chairs.

35 classrooms * 31 chairs per classroom = 1,085 chairs

The school currently has 1,093 chairs, but it only needs 1,085 chairs to distribute them equally among the 35 classrooms. 

So, the school does not need to buy more chairs. In fact, it has 8 chairs extra (1,093 - 1,085 = 8).

However, the question asks how many more chairs should be purchased. Since the school already has enough chairs, the answer is 0.

831,The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,"To find the weight difference between a bag of chips and a bottle of juice, we first need to find the weight of one bag of chips and the total weight of the bottles of juice.

We are given that the weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. So the weight of one bag of chips is 800 g / 2 = 400 g.

We are also given that the total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g, which is equal to 2200 g. The weight of 5 bags of chips is 5 * 400 g = 2000 g. So the weight of 4 bottles of juice is 2200 g - 2000 g = 200 g.

The weight of one bottle of juice is 200 g / 4 = 50 g.

We are given that the weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. We can convert this weight to grams: 5 kg 200 g = 5200 g. Since there are 4 watermelons, the weight of one watermelon is 5200 g / 4 = 1300 g.

Now, let's consider the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples, which is 5 kg 700 g. Converting this to grams, we get 5700 g. The weight of 3 watermelons is 3 * 1300 g = 3900 g. So, the weight of 4 pineapples is 5700 g - 3900 g = 1800 g. The weight of one pineapple is 1800 g / 4 = 450 g.

We know that the weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. So, the weight of one cake is 800 / 4 = 200 g.

We also know that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g, which is equal to 1100 g. Since the weight of 3 cakes is 3 x 200 = 600 g, the weight of 5 pieces of bread is 1100 - 600 = 500 g.

So, the weight of one piece of bread is 500 / 5 = 100 g.

861,"The ratio of boys to girls in a kindergarten is 2:3. If the number of boys is 12, find the number of girls.","To find the number of girls, we need to understand the given ratio of boys to girls, which is 2:3. This means that for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls.

We are given that the number of boys is 12. To find the number of girls, we can set up a proportion using the ratio.

Let's say the number of girls is 3x and the number of boys is 2x. Since we know the number of boys is 12, we can set up the equation:

2x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 3 and x:

Number of girls = 3x

This means for every 3 good oranges, there is 1 bad orange. 

Since we know there are 24 good oranges, we can set up a proportion to find the number of bad oranges. Let's assume the number of bad oranges is x. 

The ratio of good oranges to bad oranges is 3:1, so we can set up the following proportion:
24 : x = 3 : 1

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:
24 * 1 = 3 * x
24 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

Two stops later, 7 people got on 15 people got off the bus at the terminal station. How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?","To find out how many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus, we need to reverse the order of events and calculate the number of people in the bus before each stop.

At the terminal station, 15 people got off, but before that, 7 people got on and 15 people got off, so the number of people who got on the bus two stops before the terminal station doesn't change the number of people who got off at the terminal station. Therefore, to find the number of people who got on the bus before the terminal station, we need to add the number of people who got off at the terminal station to the number of people who got on two stops before the terminal station, and then subtract the number of people who got off two stops before the terminal station. However, since 7 people got on two stops before the terminal station and 15 people got off at the terminal station, and 15 people got off two stops before the terminal station, we can just add the number of people who got off at the terminal station and subtract the number of people who got off two stops before the terminal station. 15 - 15 + 7 = 7.

However, this isn't the number of people who were in the bus when Jose got on the bus. At the stop before that, 5 people got on and 2 people got off. So we need to subtract the number of people who got on and add the number of people who got off at that stop to find the number of people who were in the bus when Jose got on the bus. 7 - 5 + 2 = 4.

873,"A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?","To determine how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday, we need to consider the lunar cycle and the days of the week.

A full moon occurs every 30 days, but the days of the week repeat every 7 days. Since the last full moon occurred on a Friday, we need to find the next Friday that is a multiple of 30 days away.

The next full moon will occur 30 days after the last one, but it will not necessarily be on a Friday. To find the next full moon on a Friday, we need to add multiples of 7 days (the length of a week) to 30 days until we reach a total that is a multiple of 7.

30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days (30 = 4 x 7 + 2). To get to the next Friday, we need to add 3 more days to complete the week. Therefore, we need to add 3 days to 30 days to get to the next Friday.

However, this is not the correct approach. A better way to think about it is to consider the number of days in a week (7) and the number of days in a lunar cycle (30). To find the next full moon on a Friday, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 30.

The LCM of 7 and 30 is 210. This means that every 210 days, the full moon will occur on the same day of the week.

Therefore, the number of days that will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday is 210.

Todd gave away 18 candy bars, so he had x - 18 candy bars left.

Now, to find out how many more candy bars Rick had than Todd, we subtract the number of candy bars Todd had from the number of candy bars Rick had: (x - 11) - (x - 18).

Simplifying this, we get x - 11 - x + 18 = 7.

This means that regardless of the initial number of candy bars they had, Rick had 7 more candy bars than Todd after their actions.

894,Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. How many more marble did Ed have than Doug then?,"To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after Doug lost 8 marbles, we first need to establish the initial difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug.

Since Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug initially, let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as 'x'. Then, Ed had 'x + 22' marbles.

After Doug lost 8 marbles, he was left with 'x - 8' marbles.

The difference in the number of marbles Ed and Doug had after Doug lost 8 marbles is (x + 22) - (x - 8). 

We can simplify this expression by subtracting 'x' from 'x' and adding 22 and 8, which gives us 22 + 8 = 30.

So, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug after Doug lost 8 marbles.

895,Sara bought decorations for her party. She paid $5 for balloons and $18 for tablecloths. She also spent $9 for streamers. She paid the cashier and got $8 back. How much money did Sara give to the cashier?,"To find out how much money Sara gave to the cashier, we need to first calculate the total amount she spent on the decorations. 

She paid $5 for balloons, $18 for tablecloths, and $9 for streamers. 
So, the total amount she spent is $5 + $18 + $9 = $32.

Since she got $8 back from the cashier, it means the amount she gave to the cashier is more than the total amount she spent by $8. 
So, the amount she gave to the cashier is $32 + $8 = $40.

896,"Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans. On the second day, he found 9 cans. He found 14 cans on the third day. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?","To determine the number of cans Zachary will find on the seventh day, we need to analyze the pattern in the number of cans he found on the first three days. 

On the first day, he found 4 cans.
On the second day, he found 9 cans, which is 5 more than the first day.
On the third day, he found 14 cans, which is 5 more than the second day.

The pattern seems to be an increase of 5 cans each day. 

If this pattern continues, 
on the fourth day, he will find 14 + 5 = 19 cans.
on the fifth day, he will find 19 + 5 = 24 cans.
on the sixth day, he will find 24 + 5 = 29 cans.
on the seventh day, he will find 29 + 5 = 34 cans.

905,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,"The worm climbs 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day, so the net progress it makes is 8 - 3 = 5 inches per day.

To find out how many days it will take the worm to reach the top, we need to divide the total depth of the hole (26 inches) by the net progress it makes per day (5 inches).

However, we also need to consider that on the last day, the worm will climb out of the hole and not slide back. This means that on the last day, it will make a progress of 8 inches, not 5 inches.

Let's divide the total depth of the hole by the net progress per day: 26 / 5 = 5.2 days.

Since the worm can't climb a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, we also need to check if the worm can climb out of the hole on the 5th day.

On the 5th day, the worm will have climbed 5 * 5 = 25 inches. On the 5th day, it will climb 8 inches, which will bring it to a total of 25 + 8 = 33 inches. Since the hole is only 26 inches deep, the worm will climb out of the hole on the 5th day.

906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","Let's break down the information given:

1. Rita, Peter, and Skeeter weigh 90 pounds altogether.
2. Rita and Peter weigh the same amount.
3. Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together.

Since Rita and Peter weigh the same amount, let's denote their individual weight as 'x'. 

We know that Peter and Skeeter together weigh 68 pounds. So, we can write an equation: 
x (Peter's weight) + Skeeter's weight = 68

We also know that the total weight of all three penguins is 90 pounds. Since Rita and Peter weigh the same, we can write another equation:
x (Rita's weight) + x (Peter's weight) + Skeeter's weight = 90

Combine like terms:
2x + Skeeter's weight = 90

Now we have two equations:
x + Skeeter's weight = 68
2x + Skeeter's weight = 90

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2x + Skeeter's weight) - (x + Skeeter's weight) = 90 - 68
x = 22

Now that we know x (Rita's and Peter's weight), we can find Skeeter's weight:
x + Skeeter's weight = 68
22 + Skeeter's weight = 68
Skeeter's weight = 68 - 22
Skeeter's weight = 46

How many cards did Ben have at first?","To find out how many cards Ben had at first, we need to start with the information that after buying 3 more cards, he had twice as many cards as Tim. Since Tim had 20 cards, Ben had 2 * 20 = 40 cards after buying 3 more.

Since Ben bought 3 more cards to have 40, he must have had 40 - 3 = 37 cards at first.

909,"Alex, Brad, Calvin, and Dennis are playing checkers. Each of the 4 boys played 2 games with every other player. How many games of checkers were played altogether?","Each of the 4 boys played 2 games with every other player. This means each boy played 2 games with 3 other players, resulting in 2 * 3 = 6 games per boy.

However, when we calculate 6 games per boy for all 4 boys, each game is counted twice (once for each player involved). To avoid double-counting, we divide the total by 2.

So, the total number of games is (6 * 4) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12.

911,"Megan and her sister, Tara, wanted to buy a scooter for $26. Tara had $4 more than Megan. Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did Tara have?","Let's denote the amount of money Megan has as 'x'. Since Tara has $4 more than Megan, Tara has 'x + 4'. Together, they have enough money to buy the scooter, which costs $26. 

So, the total amount of money they have is x + (x + 4) = 26. 

Combine like terms: 2x + 4 = 26.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 2x = 22.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 11.

Since Tara has $4 more than Megan, Tara has 11 + 4 = 15.

925,Molly swam 45 meters on Saturday. She swam 28 meters on Sunday. The pool is 25 meters long. How many meters did Molly swim in all?,"To find the total distance Molly swam, we need to add the distance she swam on Saturday to the distance she swam on Sunday.

The distance she swam on Saturday was 45 meters, and the distance she swam on Sunday was 28 meters.

However, we also need to consider the length of the pool, which is 25 meters. Since Molly swam 45 meters on Saturday, this means she must have swum multiple laps in the pool. We can calculate the number of laps she swam by dividing the distance she swam by the length of the pool: 45 / 25 = 1.8 laps (but since she can't swim a fraction of a lap, this means she swam 1 full lap and then some extra distance). However, for the total distance, we don't need to worry about the laps, we just need to add the distances.

Similarly, on Sunday, she swam 28 meters, which is more than the length of the pool, so she must have swum more than one lap. Again, we don't need to worry about the laps for the total distance.

So, to find the total distance Molly swam, we simply add the distance she swam on Saturday to the distance she swam on Sunday: 45 + 28 = 73 meters.

A nickel is worth $0.05, and a quarter is worth $0.25. Since we have the same number of each kind of coin, let's say we have 'x' number of nickels and 'x' number of quarters.

The total value of the nickels is $0.05 * x, and the total value of the quarters is $0.25 * x. We know that the total value of the coins is $12. So, we can set up the equation:

$0.05x + $0.25x = $12

Combine like terms:

$0.30x = $12

Divide both sides by $0.30:

x = $12 / $0.30
x = 40

Since 'x' represents the number of nickels, we have 40 nickels.

Let's assume the amount he gets from the 2nd job is x dollars. 
Since the 1st job pays $375 more than the 2nd job, the amount he gets from the 1st job is x + $375.

We know that the total amount he gets per week is $3,875. 
This means the sum of the amounts he gets from the 1st and 2nd jobs is $3,875. 
So we can write the equation: x + (x + $375) = $3,875.

Combine like terms: 2x + $375 = $3,875.

Subtract $375 from both sides: 2x = $3,500.

Divide both sides by 2: x = $1,750.

Now that we know the amount he gets from the 2nd job, we can find the amount he gets from the 1st job.

She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?","To find the greatest number of cookies possible in each container, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30 and 48.

First, let's list the factors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
Then, list the factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.

The greatest common factor of 30 and 48 is 6. This means that each container can have 6 oatmeal cookies and 6 chocolate chip cookies.

To find the total number of containers needed, we divide the total number of each type of cookie by the number of cookies per container.

For oatmeal cookies: 30 / 6 = 5 containers.
For chocolate chip cookies: 48 / 6 = 8 containers.

However, since each container will have both types of cookies, we can use the larger number of containers, which is 8. But we can also use the smaller number of containers, which is 5, if we package the remaining 18 chocolate chip cookies (48 - 30) in 3 containers with no oatmeal cookies. However, this is not the question, the question is how many plastic containers does she need if she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible. 

So the answer is 5 containers with 6 oatmeal cookies and 6 chocolate chip cookies and 3 containers with 6 chocolate chip cookies. But this is not the question. The question is how many plastic containers does she need if she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible.

To have the greatest number of cookies possible in each container, we need to have 6 cookies of each type in each container. We can only have 5 containers with 6 cookies of each type.

1228,"Irene's Bakery sells muffins in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5. Going through yesterday's receipts, a store manager notices that the bakery sold the same number of muffins and cookies yesterday afternoon. What is the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold?","To find the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 5. 

Since 18 and 5 have no common factors, their LCM is simply their product, 18 * 5 = 90. 

However, we are looking for the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold, and it is possible that the bakery sold a multiple of the LCM. 

In this case, the LCM itself is the smallest multiple, so the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold is indeed 90.

1230,"Martha's Blossoms sells roses in groups of 9. Across town, Rachel's Blooms sells roses in groups of 19. If a customer wants to buy the same number of roses from both vendors, what is the smallest number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor?","To find the smallest number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 19.

The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180, 189, ...

The multiples of 19 are: 19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 171. This means that the customer will have to buy 171 / 9 = 19 groups of 9 roses from Martha's Blossoms and 171 / 19 = 9 groups of 19 roses from Rachel's Blooms.

However, since we want to find the smallest number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor, we can simply say that the customer will have to buy 171 roses from each vendor, but in groups of 9 from Martha's Blossoms and in groups of 19 from Rachel's Blooms.

But the actual question is how many roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor, which will be 171/9 = 19 from Martha's Blossoms and 171/19 = 9 from Rachel's Blooms. 

However, the actual question seems to be how many roses will the customer have to buy from each vendor, so the answer should be the number of roses in each group, not the number of groups. 

So the number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor is 171.

We divide 41 by 5: 41 ÷ 5 = 8.2. This means we can fill 8 compartments with 5 pieces of luggage each, but we have some luggage left over for the 9th compartment.

8 full compartments will have 8 * 5 = 40 pieces of luggage.

Now, we subtract the luggage in the full compartments from the total to find out how many pieces of luggage will be in the 9th compartment: 41 - 40 = 1.

The answer is {1}."
1240,"Luke had 9 pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?","To split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, Luke needs to divide the total number of candies by 2.

He currently has 9 pieces of candy. If he divides 9 by 2, he gets 4.5. Since he can't have half a piece of candy, he needs to have a total number of candies that is divisible by 2.

The next even number after 9 is 10. If Luke had 10 pieces of candy, he could divide them into 2 bags with 5 pieces in each bag.

To get from 9 to 10, Luke needs 1 more piece of candy.

1241,A baker had 7 boxes for donuts. He ended up making 48 donuts and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?,"To find the number of extra donuts the baker ended up with, we first need to divide the total number of donuts (48) by the number of boxes (7). 

48 / 7 = 6.857 (approximately)

This means that each box can hold 6 donuts, and there will be some leftover donuts. To find the number of leftover donuts, we multiply the number of boxes (7) by the number of donuts each box can hold (6), and then subtract this number from the total number of donuts (48).

7 * 6 = 42

48 - 42 = 6

The answer is {6}."
1243,"A school had 14 students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?","To determine how many more students need to sign up, we need to first find out how many students are needed in total for 4 teams with the same number of students on each team.

Since there are already 14 students signed up, we need to find the smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 14. This is because each team should have the same number of students.

The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 14 is 16. This means each team will have 16 / 4 = 4 students.

However, since 16 is not enough to make 4 teams with the same number of students (as 14 is less than 16), we need to find the next multiple of 4, which is 16. But the next multiple after 16 is 20 and then 16 is not enough but 20 is more than 14 and can make 4 teams of 5.

So the total number of students needed is 20, and since 14 students are already signed up, the number of additional students needed is 20 - 14 = 6.

1245,Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?,"Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. 
Since Lemon Heads come in packages of 5, we need to divide 78 by 5 to see how many packages she ate and if there are any leftover Lemon Heads.
78 / 5 = 15 remainder 3.
This means Ann ate 15 packages of 5 Lemon Heads and 3 extra Lemon Heads.
Since she ate all the extra 3 Lemon Heads and the 15 packages of 5 Lemon Heads, she doesn't have any Lemon Heads left.
The answer is {0}."
1246,Sweettarts come in packages of 7. Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts. How many Sweettarts does he have left?,"To find out how many Sweettarts Stephen has left, we need to know how many packages he had in the first place. Since we don't have that information, we will have to find out how many packages he had and then see how many Sweettarts are left.

Since each package has 7 Sweettarts and he ate 64 Sweettarts, we will divide 64 by 7 to see how many packages he had. 

64 / 7 = 9.1428571428571 ( rounded to 9.14)

Since you cannot have a fraction of a package, this means he must have had 9 packages. 

Now we multiply the number of packages by the number of Sweettarts per package to see how many Sweettarts he had in total.

9 * 7 = 63

This means he had 63 Sweettarts in total. Now we subtract the number of Sweettarts he ate to see how many he has left.

63 - 64 = -1

This means he ate 1 more Sweettart than he had. This doesn't make sense, so let's look at it from a different angle.

If he ate 64 Sweettarts, and each package has 7 Sweettarts, then we can divide 64 by 7 to see how many packages he ate.

64 / 7 = 9.1428571428571 ( rounded to 9.14)

Since you cannot have a fraction of a package, this means he must have eaten 9 packages. 

Now we multiply the number of packages by the number of Sweettarts per package to see how many Sweettarts he ate in full packages.

9 * 7 = 63

This means he ate 63 Sweettarts in full packages. Now we subtract the number of Sweettarts he ate in full packages from the total number of Sweettarts he ate to see how many Sweettarts he ate from the last package.

64 - 63 = 1

This means he ate 1 Sweettart from the last package. Now we subtract the number of Sweettarts he ate from the last package from the total number of Sweettarts in a package to see how many Sweettarts are left.

7 - 1 = 6

However, this doesn't account for the fact that we are only interested in the number of Sweettarts left, not the number of Sweettarts left in the last package. Since we know that he ate 9 full packages and 1 Sweettart from the 10th package, we know that there is 1 package left with 6 Sweettarts.

1247,Candies come in packages of 4. Shirley ate 10 candies. How many candies does she have left?,"To solve this problem, we need to know how many candies Shirley had in the beginning. Since candies come in packages of 4, let's assume Shirley had one or more packages of candies. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of candies she had initially.

Since we can't determine the exact number of candies Shirley had initially, we can't determine how many candies she has left after eating 10 candies.

However, if we assume Shirley had at least one package of candies (which is 4 candies), and she ate 10 candies, then she must have had more than one package of candies initially.

Let's assume she had x packages of candies. Then, she had 4x candies initially. After eating 10 candies, she has 4x - 10 candies left.

Since we don't know the exact number of candies Shirley had initially, we can't provide a specific answer. However, I will provide a general expression for the number of candies she has left:

4x - 10

1248,Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers. How many Jawbreakers does she have left?,"To determine how many Jawbreakers Sarah has left, we first need to know how many Jawbreakers she had in total. Since Jawbreakers come in packages of 8 and we know she ate 20, we can find the minimum number of packages she must have had. 

Since 20 Jawbreakers is more than 2 packages (2 * 8 = 16) but less than 3 packages (3 * 8 = 24), Sarah must have had at least 3 packages of Jawbreakers to eat 20 of them. 

3 packages of Jawbreakers contain 3 * 8 = 24 Jawbreakers.

If Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers, then she must have 24 - 20 = 4 Jawbreakers left.

1293,Miguel is 46 years old. He is 4 years older than thrice his son's age. Find the age of his son.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Miguel is 46 years old, and he is 4 years older than thrice his son's age. This means that if we subtract 4 from Miguel's age, we will get thrice his son's age.

Let's denote the son's age as x. Then, thrice his son's age would be 3x.

We know that Miguel is 4 years older than thrice his son's age, so we can set up the equation:

46 = 3x + 4

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides:

46 - 4 = 3x + 4 - 4
42 = 3x

Next, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

42 / 3 = 3x / 3
14 = x

So, the age of Miguel's son is 14.

We know that the sum of their ages is 22, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 7x = 22

Combine like terms:

11x = 22

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 2

Now that we know x, we can find Ashley's and Mary's ages:

Ashley's age: 4x = 4(2) = 8

1304,"The ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. Find the ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack.","Let's start by explaining the problem. We are given that the ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. This means that if we let Peter's age be x, Margaret's age would be x + 2, and Jack's age would be x + 4.

We are also given that the sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. This can be written as an equation:

x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) - 5

Combine like terms:

2x + 2 = x - 1

Subtract x from both sides:

x + 2 = -1

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = -3

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to re-examine our equation. The correct interpretation is that Jack's age before 5 years is (x + 4) - 5, which is the same as x - 1. So, the correct equation is:

x + (x + 2) = x - 1 + 5

Combine like terms:

2x + 2 = x + 4

Subtract x from both sides:

x + 2 = 4

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 2

Since x is Peter's age, Margaret's age is x + 2 = 4, and Jack's age is x + 4 = 6.

If the age of the mother is 42, find the ages of Tony and Teddy?","Let's start by using the information that the sum of the ages of Tony and Teddy equals their mother's age, which is 42. We can represent this as:

Tony's age + Teddy's age = 42

We also know that Tony is two years younger than Teddy, so we can represent this as:

Tony's age = Teddy's age - 2

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(Teddy's age - 2) + Teddy's age = 42

Combine like terms:

2 * Teddy's age - 2 = 42

Add 2 to both sides:

2 * Teddy's age = 44

Divide both sides by 2:

Teddy's age = 22

Now that we know Teddy's age, we can find Tony's age by subtracting 2:

Tony's age = Teddy's age - 2
Tony's age = 22 - 2
Tony's age = 20

Since Allen is 10 years younger than Scott, we can write an equation: 
A = S - 10

Five years from now, Scott's age will be S + 5 and Allen's age will be A + 5. However, we are given that five years from now, Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen. So, we can write another equation:
S + 5 = 2A

We can substitute the value of S from the first equation into the second equation:
(S - 10) + 5 = 2A + 5
S - 5 = 2A + 5
S - 5 = 2(S - 10)
S - 5 = 2S - 20
20 - 5 = 2S - S
15 = S

Now that we have Scott's age, we can find Allen's age using the first equation:
A = S - 10
A = 15 - 10
A = 5

So, Allen's present age is 5 and Scott's present age is 15.

Answer: [Allen = 5, Scott = 15]"

Let's break down the statement: ""Thrice the sum of a number and 2 equals 24 added with the same number.""

We can represent the unknown number as 'x'. The sum of the number and 2 is (x + 2). Thrice this sum is 3(x + 2). This expression is equal to 24 added with the same number, which is (24 + x).

Now we can write the algebraic equation:

The statement says ""A number added with thrice a number is 20."" 

Let's assume the number is 'x'. 

The statement can be broken down as follows:
- ""A number"" is x.
- ""thrice a number"" means three times the number, which is 3x.
- ""A number added with thrice a number"" means x added to 3x, which is x + 3x.
- ""is 20"" means the result of the addition is 20.

So, the algebraic equation is x + 3x = 20.

Combine like terms to simplify the equation: 4x = 20.

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 20 / 4 = 5.

Therefore, the number is 5.

1320,Wilson has a number in mind. If he takes away one-third of the number from it the result is sixteen-third. Find the number.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Wilson has a number in mind, and when he takes away one-third of the number from it, the result is sixteen-thirds.

Let's call the original number ""x"". When Wilson takes away one-third of the number, he is essentially subtracting x/3 from x.

So, the equation can be written as:

x - x/3 = 16/3

To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions:

3x - x = 16

This simplifies to:

2x = 16

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 16/2
x = 8

So, the original number that Wilson had in mind is 8.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to check if this number satisfies the original condition.

If we take away one-third of 8 from 8, we get:

8 - 8/3 = 8 - 2.67 = 5.33

This is not equal to 16/3. So, our initial answer is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the equation:

x - x/3 = 16/3

We can rewrite this equation as:

(2x)/3 = 16/3

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 16/2
x = 8

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to re-evaluate the equation.

x - x/3 = 16/3

We can rewrite this equation as:

(2x)/3 = 16/3

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

x = 16/2 * 3/2
x = 24/2
x = 12 * 3/3
x = 36/3
x = 12

However, we made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's correct it.

x - x/3 = 16/3

We can rewrite this equation as:

(2x)/3 = 16/3

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

x = 16 * 3/2 / 3
x = 16 * 1 / 2 * 3 / 3
x = 16 * 1 / 2
x = 16/2 * 3
x = 8 * 3
x = 24/3 * 3
x = 24

However, we made another mistake. Let's correct it.

x - x/3 = 16/3

We can rewrite this equation as:

(2x)/3 = 16/3

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

x = 16 * 3/2 / 3 * 3/3
x = 16 * 3/2 / 3 * 3/3
x = 16 * 3/2
x = 16 * 3/2 * 3/3
x = 48/2
x = 48/2 * 3/3
x = 48/6
x = 8 * 3/3
x = 24/3 * 3
x = 24

However, we made another mistake. Let's correct it.

x - x/3 = 16/3

We can rewrite this equation as:

(2x)/3 = 16/3

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

2x = 16

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

x = 16 * 3/2 / 2
x = 16 * 3/2 / 2 * 3/3
x = 16 * 3/2 / 2
x = 16 * 3/4
x = 16 * 3/4 * 4/4
x = 48/4
x = 12

However, we made another mistake. Let's correct it.

x - x/3 = 16/3

We can rewrite this equation as:

(2x)/3 = 16/3

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

2x = 16

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

x = 16 * 3/2 / 2
x = 16 * 3/2 / 2 * 3/3
x = 16 * 3/2 / 2
x = 16 * 3/4
x = 16 * 3/4 * 4/4
x = 48/4
x = 12

1322,The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 42. Choose suitable variable and create single variable algebraic equations and find the difference between the greatest and smallest number.,"To solve this problem, we can start by defining a variable to represent the smallest of the three consecutive even numbers. Let's call this variable x.

Since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, the next number will be x + 2, and the greatest number will be x + 4.

We know that the sum of these three numbers is 42, so we can write an equation:

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 42

Combine like terms:

3x + 6 = 42

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 36

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the smallest number is 12, we can find the other two numbers:

x + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14
x + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16

The three consecutive even numbers are 12, 14, and 16.

The greatest number is 16, and the smallest number is 12. To find the difference, we subtract the smallest number from the greatest number:

16 - 12 = 4

1323,One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that one-third of a certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Let's denote the number as 'x'.

We can write this as an equation:

(1/3)x + (1/5)x = (8/15)x

To simplify, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:

(5/15)x + (3/15)x = (8/15)x

Combine like terms:

(8/15)x = (8/15)x

This equation is true for any value of x, but it doesn't help us find the specific number we're looking for. However, we can try to find a specific solution by assuming that the original statement is trying to convey that the number is a specific value.

Let's try to find a simple solution by assuming that the number is a multiple of 15 (since we're dealing with fractions of 15). 

Suppose x = 15. Then:

(1/3)(15) + (1/5)(15) = (8/15)(15)
5 + 3 = 8

This is true, but it's a trivial solution. Let's try to find a more general solution.

Suppose x = 15k, where k is an integer. Then:

(1/3)(15k) + (1/5)(15k) = (8/15)(15k)
5k + 3k = 8k

This is true for any value of k. Therefore, we can conclude that the number is a multiple of 15.

However, we can't find a unique solution without more information. The problem statement is somewhat ambiguous, and it's possible that the intended solution is simply x = 15.

Answer: {15}"
1324,The difference between one-third of a number and 5 is 10. Find the number.,"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number be represented by 'x'. We are given that the difference between one-third of the number and 5 is 10.

We can set up an equation based on this information: (1/3)x - 5 = 10.

To solve for 'x', we can start by adding 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with 'x': (1/3)x = 10 + 5.

This simplifies to: (1/3)x = 15.

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for 'x': x = 15 * 3.

This simplifies to: x = 45.

Therefore, the number we are looking for is 45.

Answer: {45}"
1326,"The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 15. If the digits in the tenth place 8, find the two digit number.","To find the two-digit number, we need to find the digit in the ones place. We know that the sum of the digits is 15 and the digit in the tens place is 8. 

Let's denote the digit in the ones place as x. The sum of the digits can be represented as 8 + x = 15.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 15 - 8.

x = 7.

So, the digit in the ones place is 7. The two-digit number is 87.

Answer: {87}"
1331,A number equals 5 times the difference between the number and 4. Find the number.,"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's call the number ""x"".

The problem states that the number equals 5 times the difference between the number and 4. This can be written as an equation:

x = 5(x - 4)

Now, let's simplify the equation by distributing the 5 to the terms inside the parentheses:

x = 5x - 20

Next, let's add 20 to both sides of the equation to get:

x + 20 = 5x

Now, let's subtract x from both sides to get:

20 = 4x

Finally, let's divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 20/4
x = 5

So, the number is 5.

1333,A rectangular cupboard is of length 6 m and perimeter 20 m. Find the width of the cupboard.,"To find the width of the cupboard, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). We are given that the length is 6m and the perimeter is 20m.

Let's start by using the formula: 20 = 2(6 + Width)
Now, we can simplify the equation: 20 = 12 + 2(Width)
Subtract 12 from both sides: 8 = 2(Width)
Divide both sides by 2: 4 = Width

Answer: {4}"
1339,"The length of the rectangular building is 7 ft more than its width. If the perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft, find its length and width.","To find the length and width of the rectangular building, let's denote the width as 'w' and the length as 'l'. We are given that the length is 7 ft more than the width, so we can express the length in terms of the width as l = w + 7.

We are also given that the perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times the sum of its length and width, so we can write the equation as 2(l + w) = 98.

Substituting l = w + 7 into the equation, we get 2(w + 7 + w) = 98. Combining like terms, we get 2(2w + 7) = 98. Expanding the equation, we get 4w + 14 = 98.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 4w = 84. Dividing both sides by 4, we get w = 21.

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by substituting w = 21 into the equation l = w + 7. We get l = 21 + 7 = 28.

Therefore, the width of the building is 21 ft and the length is 28 ft.

Answer: [21 ft, 28 ft]"
1344,"A rectangular swimming pool was constructed for Kids at Hotel Park. The length of the swimming pool is twice its width. If the length is 16 ft, find the width and area of the pool.","The length of the swimming pool is twice its width. 
This means if we denote the width as W, then the length will be 2W.
We are given that the length is 16 ft.
So we can say 2W = 16 ft.

Now that we know the width is 8 ft and the length is 16 ft, we can find the area.
The area of a rectangle is given by length * width.
So the area of the pool is 16 * 8 = 128 sq ft.
The answer is {8, 128}."

1347,If the second angle is 32 degree less than thrice the first angle and the third angle is 28 degree less than twice the first angle. Find the angles of the triangle.,"To find the angles of the triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the first angle as x.

We are given that the second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle, so the second angle can be expressed as 3x - 32.

We are also given that the third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle, so the third angle can be expressed as 2x - 28.

Now, we can write the equation:

x + (3x - 32) + (2x - 28) = 180

Combine like terms:

6x - 60 = 180

Add 60 to both sides:

6x = 240

Divide by 6:

x = 40

Now that we have found the first angle, we can find the second and third angles:

Second angle: 3x - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 120 - 32 = 88

Third angle: 2x - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 80 - 28 = 52

So, the angles of the triangle are 40, 88, and 52 degrees.

After 12 years, the son's age will be x + 12, and the man's age will be 3x + 12.

According to the problem, after 12 years, the man will be twice as old as his son. We can set up an equation based on this information:

3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 12 = 2x + 24

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

1399,Mrs.Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. After 8 years she will be twice as old as Neil. Find their present ages.,"Let's denote Neil's current age as N and Mrs. Martin's current age as M.

We know that Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than Neil, so we can write an equation:
M = N + 27

After 8 years, Mrs. Martin's age will be M + 8, and Neil's age will be N + 8. We also know that after 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil, so we can write another equation:
M + 8 = 2(N + 8)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
N + 27 + 8 = 2(N + 8)

Simplifying the equation:
N + 35 = 2N + 16

Subtracting N from both sides:
35 = N + 16

Subtracting 16 from both sides:
19 = N

Now that we know Neil's current age, we can find Mrs. Martin's current age:
M = N + 27
M = 19 + 27
M = 46

So, Neil's current age is 19, and Mrs. Martin's current age is 46.

x + x + 2x = 180

Combine like terms:

4x = 180

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 45

Now that we know the base angles are 45 degrees, we can find the vertex angle:

Vertex angle = 2x

1401,"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?","Let's denote the number of heaps of 6 marbles as x and the number of heaps of 9 marbles as y.

We know that the total number of heaps is 72, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 72

We also know that the total number of marbles is 480. Since each heap of 6 marbles contains 6 marbles and each heap of 9 marbles contains 9 marbles, we can write another equation:

6x + 9y = 480

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 6 and subtracting it from the second equation:

6x + 6y = 432
6x + 9y = 480

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

3y = 48

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

y = 16

Now that we know y, we can find x by substituting y into one of the original equations:

x + y = 72
x + 16 = 72

Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get:

x = 56

Now that we know x and y, we can find the number of marbles each boy has. The first boy has 6x marbles:

6x = 6(56) = 336

The second boy has 9y marbles:

9y = 9(16) = 144

So, the first boy has 336 marbles and the second boy has 144 marbles.

1403,"The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. After 5 years, sum of their ages would be 70 years. Find their present ages.","Let's denote Jacob's present age as 'J' and his father's present age as 'F'. According to the problem, F = 3J.

We are also given that after 5 years, the sum of their ages would be 70. So, (J + 5) + (F + 5) = 70.

Now, we can substitute F = 3J into the equation above: (J + 5) + (3J + 5) = 70.

Combine like terms: 4J + 10 = 70.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 4J = 60.

Divide by 4: J = 15.

Now that we have Jacob's age, we can find his father's age: F = 3J = 3 * 15 = 45.

So, Jacob's present age is 15 and his father's present age is 45.

Answer: [Jacob: 15, Father: 45]"
1404,"Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.","To solve this problem, let's denote the width of the rectangle as 'w'. Since the length is 8 meters less than twice its width, the length can be expressed as 2w - 8.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides, which is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width). We are given that the perimeter is 56 meters.

Substituting the expressions for length and width into the formula, we get:
56 = 2((2w - 8) + w)

Simplifying the equation:
56 = 2(3w - 8)
56 = 6w - 16

Adding 16 to both sides of the equation:
72 = 6w

Dividing both sides by 6:
w = 12

Now that we have found the width, we can find the length by substituting w into the expression for length:
Length = 2w - 8
= 2(12) - 8
= 24 - 8
= 16

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 12 meters and the length is 16 meters.

1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","Let's denote Jacob's present age as J and his son's present age as S.

Five years hence, Jacob's age will be J + 5 and his son's age will be S + 5. According to the problem, Jacob's age will be three times that of his son, so we can write the equation:

J + 5 = 3(S + 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

J + 5 = 3S + 15
J = 3S + 10

Now, let's consider the situation five years ago. Jacob's age was J - 5 and his son's age was S - 5. According to the problem, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son, so we can write the equation:

J - 5 = 7(S - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

J - 5 = 7S - 35
J = 7S - 30

Now we have two equations:

J = 3S + 10
J = 7S - 30

Equating the two expressions for J, we get:

3S + 10 = 7S - 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4S = 40
S = 10

Now that we have S, we can find J:

J = 3S + 10
J = 3(10) + 10
J = 40

So, Jacob's present age is 40 and his son's present age is 10.

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","To solve this problem, we'll use algebra. Let's denote my current age as ""A"" and my son's current age as ""S"".

Five years ago, I was ""A - 5"" years old, and my son was ""S - 5"" years old. According to the problem, five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son, so we can set up the equation:

A - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
A - 5 = 3S - 15
A = 3S - 10

Now, let's consider the situation ten years later. At that time, I will be ""A + 10"" years old, and my son will be ""S + 10"" years old. According to the problem, ten years later, I shall be twice as old as my son, so we can set up the equation:

A + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
A + 10 = 2S + 20
A = 2S + 10

Now we have two equations with two variables:

A = 3S - 10
A = 2S + 10

Since both equations are equal to A, we can set them equal to each other:

3S - 10 = 2S + 10

Solving for S, we get:
3S - 2S = 10 + 10
S = 20

Now that we know S, we can find A by substituting S into one of the original equations:

A = 3S - 10
A = 3(20) - 10
A = 60 - 10
A = 50

1413,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.","Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the present age of the father be F, and the present ages of the two sons be S1 and S2.

Since one son is two years older than the other, we can write S1 = S2 + 2.

Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of their father's age. This means that (S1 - 10) + (S2 - 10) = (1/3)(F - 10).

We are also given that the sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. This means that S1 + S2 = F - 14.

We can now substitute S1 = S2 + 2 into the above equations to get:

(S2 + 2 - 10) + (S2 - 10) = (1/3)(F - 10)
S2 + 2 - 10 + S2 - 10 = (1/3)(F - 10)
2S2 - 18 = (1/3)(F - 10)

S2 + 2 + S2 = F - 14
2S2 + 2 = F - 14

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for S2 by multiplying the first equation by 3 and then substituting the expression for F from the second equation:

3(2S2 - 18) = F - 10
6S2 - 54 = F - 10
6S2 - 54 + 10 = F
6S2 - 44 = F

Substituting this expression for F into the second equation, we get:

2S2 + 2 = 6S2 - 44 - 14
2S2 + 2 = 6S2 - 58
-4S2 = -60
S2 = 15

Now that we have S2, we can find S1 and F:

S1 = S2 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17
F = 6S2 - 44 = 6(15) - 44 = 90 - 44 = 46

Therefore, the present ages of the father and the two sons are 46, 17, and 15.

Let the son's age be x and the father's age be y.

According to the problem, if twice the son's age is added to the father's age, the sum is 70. This can be represented as:

2x + y = 70

Similarly, if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. This can be represented as:

x + 2y = 95

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x the same in both equations:

2x + 4y = 190

Now we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate x:

(2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 190 - 70
3y = 120

Now we can divide by 3 to find y:

y = 120 / 3
y = 40

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find x. Let's use the first equation:

2x + y = 70
2x + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2x = 30

Divide by 2:

x = 15

So the son's age is 15 and the father's age is 40.

1415,"I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?","To solve this problem, let's start by defining some variables. Let's say I (the parent) am 'x' years old, and my son is 'y' years old.

Since I am three times as old as my son, we can write an equation based on this information:

x = 3y

Now, let's consider what will happen five years later. I will be x + 5 years old, and my son will be y + 5 years old. According to the problem, five years later, I will be two and a half times as old as my son. We can write another equation based on this information:

x + 5 = 2.5(y + 5)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for y.

3y + 5 = 2.5(y + 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

3y + 5 = 2.5y + 12.5

Subtracting 2.5y from both sides gives:

0.5y + 5 = 12.5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:

0.5y = 7.5

Dividing both sides by 0.5 gives:

y = 15

Now that we know y, we can find x by substituting y into the first equation:

x = 3y
x = 3(15)
x = 45

So, I am 45 years old, and my son is 15 years old.

1417,The ages of two friends Anna and Ben differ by 3 years. Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years. Find the ages of Anna and Ben.,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Anna's age as A, Ben's age as B, Denver's age as D, and Cathy's age as C.

We know that the ages of two friends Anna and Ben differ by 3 years, so we can write an equation:
B = A + 3 or A = B - 3 (since we don't know who is older yet)

We also know that Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna, so:
D = 2A

Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy, so:
B = 2C

The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years, so:
D = C + 30

Now we have a system of equations. We can start by substituting D = 2A into the last equation:
2A = C + 30

We can also substitute B = 2C into the first equation:
2C = A + 3 (since we don't know who is older yet, we'll try both possibilities)

Let's try to solve for A and B using these equations.

From 2A = C + 30, we can express C as:
C = 2A - 30

Substituting this into 2C = A + 3, we get:
2(2A - 30) = A + 3
4A - 60 = A + 3
3A = 63
A = 21

Now we can find B:
B = A + 3 (since A is 21, B must be older)
B = 21 + 3
B = 24

So, Anna is 21 years old, and Ben is 24 years old.

Five years ago, Nancy was N - 5 years old and Sam was S - 5 years old. According to the problem, five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

N - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

N - 5 = 3S - 15
N = 3S - 10

Now, let's look at the situation ten years later. Nancy will be N + 10 years old and Sam will be S + 10 years old. According to the problem, ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

N + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Simplifying the equation:

N + 10 = 2S + 20
N = 2S + 10

Now we have two equations:

N = 3S - 10
N = 2S + 10

Since both equations are equal to N, we can set them equal to each other:

3S - 10 = 2S + 10

Simplifying the equation:

S = 20

Now that we know Sam's age, we can find Nancy's age by substituting S into one of the equations:

N = 3S - 10

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the tens place and 'b' is the digit in the ones place.

The number obtained by reversing the order of digits is 10b + a.

According to the problem, seven times the original number is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)

Expanding the equation, we get:

70a + 7b = 40b + 4a

Rearranging the terms, we get:

70a - 4a = 40b - 7b

66a = 33b

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

22a = 11b

Dividing both sides by 11, we get:

2a = b

Now, we are also given that the sum of the digits is 3. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

a + b = 3

Substituting the value of b from the previous equation (2a = b), we get:

a + 2a = 3

3a = 3

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

a = 1

Substituting the value of a in the equation 2a = b, we get:

2(1) = b

b = 2

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 2 = 12.

We are given a two-digit number. Let's call the tens digit 'a' and the units digit 'b'. The number can be represented as 10a + b.

The sum of the digits is 8, so we can write an equation:
a + b = 8

We are also given that the difference between the number and the number formed by reversing the digits is 18. When we reverse the digits, the new number becomes 10b + a. The difference between the original number and the reversed number is:
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 18
Simplifying the equation, we get:
9a - 9b = 18
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
a - b = 2

Now we have two equations:
a + b = 8
a - b = 2

Adding the two equations, we get:
2a = 10
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
a = 5

Substituting a = 5 into the first equation, we get:
5 + b = 8
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:
b = 3

So, the original number is 10a + b = 10(5) + 3 = 53.

1426,"A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.","To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations using the information given. Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as 'b' and the speed of the stream as 's'.

When the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is reduced by the speed of the stream. So, the speed of the boat upstream is (b - s). When it goes downstream, its effective speed is increased by the speed of the stream, so the speed of the boat downstream is (b + s).

From the first scenario, we know that the boat travels 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. We can set up the equation based on the formula: time = distance/speed.

Time taken to travel upstream = 30 / (b - s)
Time taken to travel downstream = 44 / (b + s)

The total time is 10 hours, so we can write the equation as:
30 / (b - s) + 44 / (b + s) = 10

From the second scenario, we know that the boat travels 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream in 13 hours. We can set up another equation:
40 / (b - s) + 55 / (b + s) = 13

Now we have two equations and two variables. To solve for 'b' and 's', we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, let's simplify the equations by multiplying both sides of each equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is (b - s)(b + s).

For the first equation:
30(b + s) + 44(b - s) = 10(b - s)(b + s)

Expanding and simplifying:
30b + 30s + 44b - 44s = 10(b^2 - s^2)
74b - 14s = 10b^2 - 10s^2

For the second equation:
40(b + s) + 55(b - s) = 13(b - s)(b + s)

Expanding and simplifying:
40b + 40s + 55b - 55s = 13(b^2 - s^2)
95b - 15s = 13b^2 - 13s^2

Now we have two simplified equations:
74b - 14s = 10b^2 - 10s^2
95b - 15s = 13b^2 - 13s^2

We can multiply the first equation by 13 and the second equation by 10 to make the coefficients of b^2 and s^2 the same:
962b - 182s = 130b^2 - 130s^2
950b - 150s = 130b^2 - 130s^2

Now we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate b^2 and s^2:
12b - 32s = 0

Now we can solve for b in terms of s:
12b = 32s
b = (32/12)s
b = (8/3)s

Now we can substitute this expression for b into one of the original equations to solve for s. Let's use the first equation:
30 / (b - s) + 44 / (b + s) = 10

Substituting b = (8/3)s:
30 / ((8/3)s - s) + 44 / ((8/3)s + s) = 10

Simplifying:
30 / ((5/3)s) + 44 / ((11/3)s) = 10

Multiplying both sides by (11/3)s to eliminate the fractions:
(90/5) + (484/11) = 10(11/3)s

Simplifying:
18 + 44 = 10(11/3)s
62 = 10(11/3)s

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
186 = 110s

Dividing both sides by 110:
s = 186/110
s = 93/55
s = 1.6 (approximately)

Now we can find b using the expression b = (8/3)s:
b = (8/"
1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.","To find Tara's speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current, we need to understand the concept of relative speed. When Tara rows downstream, her speed is aided by the speed of the current, so her effective speed is the sum of her speed in still water and the speed of the current. Conversely, when she rows upstream, her speed is hindered by the speed of the current, so her effective speed is the difference between her speed in still water and the speed of the current.

Let's denote Tara's speed in still water as 's' and the speed of the current as 'c'. 

When Tara rows downstream, her effective speed is (s + c). We know that she can row 20 km in 2 hours, so her effective speed downstream is 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/h. Therefore, we can write the equation: s + c = 10.

When Tara rows upstream, her effective speed is (s - c). We know that she can row 4 km in 2 hours, so her effective speed upstream is 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/h. Therefore, we can write the equation: s - c = 2.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 's' and 'c' by adding the two equations:

(s + c) + (s - c) = 10 + 2
2s = 12
s = 6 km/h (speed of rowing in still water)

Now that we have 's', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'c':

s + c = 10
6 + c = 10
c = 4 km/h (speed of the current)

Answer: [6 km/h, 4 km/h]"
1428,A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current. 

First, let's denote the speed of the sailor in still water as 's' and the speed of the current as 'c'. 

When the sailor goes downstream, the speed of the sailor relative to the ground is the sum of the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current. So, the speed downstream is (s + c). 

We know that the sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes. To find the speed, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 40 minutes is 40/60 = 2/3 hours. 

Now, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. The speed downstream is 8 km / (2/3) hours = 12 km/h. 

So, we have the equation: s + c = 12. 

When the sailor goes upstream, the speed of the sailor relative to the ground is the difference between the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current. So, the speed upstream is (s - c). 

We know that the sailor comes back in 1 hour. The distance is the same, 8 km. 

Using the formula: speed = distance / time, the speed upstream is 8 km / 1 hour = 8 km/h. 

So, we have the equation: s - c = 8. 

Now, we have two equations: 
s + c = 12 
s - c = 8 

We can solve these equations by adding them: 
2s = 20 
s = 10 

Now that we have the speed of the sailor in still water (s = 10), we can find the speed of the current (c) by substituting s into one of the equations: 
10 + c = 12 
c = 2 

Answer: [The speed of the sailor in still water is 10 km/h and the speed of the current is 2 km/h.]"
1430,"Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.","To solve this problem, we will first define the speed of the train as 't' km/h and the speed of the taxi as 'x' km/h.

We know that distance = speed * time. So, we can set up the equations for the two scenarios:

Scenario 1: 
300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took 5 hours 30 minutes = 5.5 hours
Time taken by train = 300 / t
Time taken by taxi = 200 / x
Total time = 300 / t + 200 / x = 5.5

Scenario 2: 
260 km by train and 240 km by taxi, it took 5 hours 30 minutes + 6 minutes = 5.6 hours
Time taken by train = 260 / t
Time taken by taxi = 240 / x
Total time = 260 / t + 240 / x = 5.6

We can now set up the equations:
300 / t + 200 / x = 5.5
260 / t + 240 / x = 5.6

To simplify the equations, we can multiply both sides of the equations by tx to get rid of the fractions:
300x + 200t = 5.5tx
260x + 240t = 5.6tx

Now, we can rearrange the equations to isolate the terms with tx:
300x - 5.5tx = -200t
260x - 5.6tx = -240t

Factoring out x:
x(300 - 5.5t) = -200t
x(260 - 5.6t) = -240t

Now, we can divide both equations by x:
300 - 5.5t = -200t / x
260 - 5.6t = -240t / x

Since we are looking for the speed of the train and taxi, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
300 - 5.5t = 260 - 5.6t

Now, we can solve for t:
300 - 260 = 5.6t - 5.5t
40 = 0.1t
t = 400 km/h

Now that we have the speed of the train, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the speed of the taxi:
300 / t + 200 / x = 5.5
300 / 400 + 200 / x = 5.5
0.75 + 200 / x = 5.5
200 / x = 4.75
x = 200 / 4.75

The answer is [t = 400 km/h, x = 42.11 km/h]."
1431,"A man travels 600 km partly by train and partly by car. If he covers 400 km by train and the rest by car, it takes him 6 hours and 30 minutes. But if he travels 200 km by train and rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and that of car.","To find the speed of the train and the car, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the speed of the train as 'T' km/h and the speed of the car as 'C' km/h.

In the first scenario, the man travels 400 km by train and 200 km by car, taking a total of 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is 6.5 hours. We can set up the equation:

(400 / T) + (200 / C) = 6.5

In the second scenario, the man travels 200 km by train and 400 km by car, taking a total of 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

(200 / T) + (400 / C) = 7

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'T' and 'C' by manipulating these equations.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1, we get:

(800 / T) + (400 / C) = 13
- (200 / T) - (400 / C) = -7

Adding these two equations together, we get:

(600 / T) = 6

Multiplying both sides by T, we get:

600 = 6T

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

T = 100 km/h

Now that we have the speed of the train, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the speed of the car. Let's use the first equation:

(400 / 100) + (200 / C) = 6.5

Simplifying, we get:

4 + (200 / C) = 6.5

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

(200 / C) = 2.5

Multiplying both sides by C, we get:

200 = 2.5C

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we get:

C = 80 km/h

Therefore, the speed of the train is 100 km/h and the speed of the car is 80 km/h.

1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","To find the charge for a 25 km journey, we need to first determine the fixed charge and the charge per kilometer.

Let's denote the fixed charge as F and the charge per kilometer as C.

For a 10 km journey, the total charge is $75, which is the sum of the fixed charge and the charge for the distance covered (10C). This can be expressed as:

F + 10C = 75

For a 15 km journey, the total charge is $110, which is the sum of the fixed charge and the charge for the distance covered (15C). This can be expressed as:

F + 15C = 110

Now, we can solve these two equations to find the values of F and C.

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

5C = 35
C = 7

Now, we can substitute the value of C into one of the original equations to find the value of F:

F + 10(7) = 75
F + 70 = 75
F = 5

Now that we know the fixed charge (F = 5) and the charge per kilometer (C = 7), we can calculate the charge for a 25 km journey:

Charge = F + 25C
= 5 + 25(7)
= 5 + 175
= 180

The answer is {180}."
1433,A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Let's denote the basic first class full fare as F and the reservation charge as R. 

We know that one reserved first class ticket from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216. This means the basic fare plus the reservation charge equals $216. So we can write an equation:

F + R = 216

We also know that one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. The half ticket costs half the basic fare plus the same reservation charge. So we can write another equation:

F + F/2 + R + R = 327

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

1.5F + 2R = 327

Now we have two equations:

F + R = 216
1.5F + 2R = 327

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of R the same:

2F + 2R = 432

Now we subtract the second equation from this new equation:

(2F + 2R) - (1.5F + 2R) = 432 - 327
0.5F = 105

Dividing by 0.5, we get:

F = 210

Now we can substitute F into the first equation to find R:

210 + R = 216
R = 6

So the basic first class full fare is $210 and the reservation charge is $6.

Answer: [210, 6]"
1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let's denote the original speed of the man as 's' km/hr and the distance covered as 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance at the original speed is given by:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = d / s

Now, if the man walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his new speed is (s + 0.5) km/hr. The time taken to cover the same distance at this new speed is:

New Time = d / (s + 0.5)

According to the problem, if he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hour less. So, we can write:

d / s - d / (s + 0.5) = 1

Now, if the man walks 1 km/hr slower, his new speed is (s - 1) km/hr. The time taken to cover the same distance at this new speed is:

New Time = d / (s - 1)

According to the problem, if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 hours more. So, we can write:

d / (s - 1) - d / s = 3

We can solve these two equations to find the values of 'd' and 's'.

First, let's simplify the first equation:

d / s - d / (s + 0.5) = 1
d(s + 0.5) / s(s + 0.5) - d(s) / s(s + 0.5) = 1
d(s + 0.5 - s) / s(s + 0.5) = 1
0.5d / s(s + 0.5) = 1

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

d / (s - 1) - d / s = 3
d(s) / s(s - 1) - d(s - 1) / s(s - 1) = 3
d(s - s + 1) / s(s - 1) = 3
d / s(s - 1) = 3

Now we have two simplified equations:

0.5d / s(s + 0.5) = 1
d / s(s - 1) = 3

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get:

d / s(s + 0.5) = 2

Now, we can divide the second equation by the first equation:

d / s(s - 1) / d / s(s + 0.5) = 3 / 2
s(s + 0.5) / s(s - 1) = 3 / 2
(s + 0.5) / (s - 1) = 3 / 2
2(s + 0.5) = 3(s - 1)
2s + 1 = 3s - 3
s = 4

Now that we have the value of 's', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'd':

d / s(s - 1) = 3
d / 4(4 - 1) = 3
d / 12 = 3
d = 36

Therefore, the distance covered by the man is 36 km, and his original rate of walking is 4 km/hr.

1444,"A person invested some amount at 12% simple interest and some amount at 10% simple interest. He received an annual interest of $130. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?","To solve this problem, let's denote the amount invested at 12% simple interest as x and the amount invested at 10% simple interest as y.

The annual interest from the 12% investment is 0.12x and the annual interest from the 10% investment is 0.10y. The total interest received is $130, so we can set up the equation:

0.12x + 0.10y = 130

If the person had interchanged the investments, the interest from the 12% investment would be 0.12y and the interest from the 10% investment would be 0.10x. The total interest received in this case would be $130 + $4 = $134, so we can set up the equation:

0.12y + 0.10x = 134

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 0.10 and the second equation by 0.12, and then subtracting the two equations.

0.12x + 0.10y = 130
0.10(0.12x + 0.10y) = 0.10(130)
0.012x + 0.01y = 13

0.12y + 0.10x = 134
0.12(0.12y + 0.10x) = 0.12(134)
0.0144y + 0.012x = 16.08

Now subtract the two equations:

(0.0144y + 0.012x) - (0.012x + 0.01y) = 16.08 - 13
0.0044y = 3.08
y = 3.08 / 0.0044
y = 700

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of x:

0.12x + 0.10y = 130
0.12x + 0.10(700) = 130
0.12x + 70 = 130
0.12x = 60
x = 60 / 0.12
x = 500

So the person invested $500 at 12% simple interest and $700 at 10% simple interest.

After 12 years, the son's age will be x + 12, and the father's age will be 3x + 12.

According to the problem, after 12 years, the father's age will be twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as:

3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)

Expanding the equation:

3x + 12 = 2x + 24

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

x + 12 = 24

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

x = 12

So, the present age of the son is 12 years. The father's present age is 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 years.

1446,The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.,"To find the two supplementary angles, we need to understand that supplementary angles are two angles whose sum is 180 degrees. 

Let's assume the smaller angle is x. Since the larger angle exceeds the smaller angle by 18 degrees, the larger angle is x + 18.

We know that the sum of the two angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 180

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 180

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 162

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 81

Now that we have the value of the smaller angle (x), we can find the value of the larger angle:

Larger angle = x + 18 = 81 + 18 = 99

Therefore, the two supplementary angles are 81 degrees and 99 degrees.

1447,"The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.","To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * breadth. Let's denote the original length and breadth as L and B, respectively.

From the first statement, we know that when the length is reduced by 5 units and the breadth is increased by 3 units, the area is reduced by 9 square units. We can write this as:

(L - 5) * (B + 3) = L * B - 9

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

L * B + 3L - 5B - 15 = L * B - 9

Subtracting L * B from both sides gives:

3L - 5B - 15 = -9

Adding 15 to both sides gives:

3L - 5B = 6

From the second statement, we know that when the length is increased by 3 units and the breadth is increased by 2 units, the area is increased by 67 square units. We can write this as:

(L + 3) * (B + 2) = L * B + 67

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

L * B + 2L + 3B + 6 = L * B + 67

Subtracting L * B from both sides gives:

2L + 3B + 6 = 67

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives:

2L + 3B = 61

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, and then subtracting the two equations.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 gives:

6L - 10B = 12

Multiplying the second equation by 3 gives:

6L + 9B = 183

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives:

19B = 171

Dividing both sides by 19 gives:

B = 9

Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for L. We'll use the first equation:

3L - 5B = 6

Substituting B = 9 gives:

3L - 5(9) = 6

Expanding the equation gives:

3L - 45 = 6

Adding 45 to both sides gives:

3L = 51

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

L = 17

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 17 units by 9 units.

1452,"In a 2-digit number, the tens digit is 4 times the units digit. When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. Find the original number.","To solve this problem, let's denote the tens digit as T and the units digit as U. Since the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, we can write the equation:

T = 4U

We also know that when the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. This means that the original number can be written as 10T + U, and the new number can be written as 10U + T. The difference between the two numbers is 54, so we can write the equation:

(10T + U) - (10U + T) = 54

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9T - 9U = 54

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

T - U = 6

Now we have two equations:

T = 4U
T - U = 6

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

4U - U = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3U = 6

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

U = 2

Now that we know U, we can find T:

T = 4U
T = 4(2)
T = 8

So the original number is 10T + U = 10(8) + 2 = 82.

Let Ajith's current age be x. Since Anil is 9 years older than Ajith, Anil's current age is x + 9.

In 10 years, Anil's age will be x + 9 + 10 = x + 19.

10 years ago, Ajith's age was x - 10.

According to the problem, in 10 years, Anil will be twice as old as Ajith was 10 years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 19 = 2(x - 10)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 19 = 2x - 20

Adding 20 to both sides, we get:

x + 39 = 2x

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

39 = x

So, Ajith's current age is 39 years.

Since Anil is 9 years older than Ajith, Anil's current age is 39 + 9 = 48 years.

Combine like terms:

2x + 2 = 30

Subtract 2 from both sides:

2x = 28

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 14

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"Let's call the measure of the first angle x. Since the second angle is the same size as the first angle, the measure of the second angle is also x.

We are told that the third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so the measure of the third angle is x - 12.

The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, so we can set up the following equation:

x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

3x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

3x = 192

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 64

Now that we know the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The second angle is the same size as the first angle, so its measure is also 64 degrees. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so its measure is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

1471,The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the measure of the first angle as x.

Since the second angle is five times as large as the first, the measure of the second angle is 5x.

The third angle is 12 degrees greater than the first angle, so the measure of the third angle is x + 12.

We know that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 5x + (x + 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 180

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 24

Now that we know the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the second and third angles:

Second angle: 5x = 5(24) = 120

We are given that the total capital is $7500. This means the sum of the capitals furnished by Jamal and Moshe is equal to $7500.

We can write the equation as follows:
x + x/2 = 7500

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + x = 15000
Combine like terms:
3x = 15000

Now, divide both sides by 3:
x = 5000

This means Moshe furnished $5000. Since Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe, Jamal furnished $5000/2 = $2500.

The answer is {$2500 for Jamal and $5000 for Moshe}."

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 6. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 2. So the shorter piece is 2 ft long, and the longer piece is 2x = 4 ft long.

Answer: {2 ft and 4 ft}"
1484,"The total cost for tuition plus room and board at State University is $2,584. Tuition costs $704 more than room and board. What is the tuition fee?","To find the tuition fee, we need to first find the cost of room and board. Let's denote the cost of room and board as x.

Since tuition costs $704 more than room and board, the tuition fee can be expressed as x + 704.

We know that the total cost for tuition plus room and board is $2,584. We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 704) = 2584

Combine like terms:

2x + 704 = 2584

Subtract 704 from both sides:

2x = 1880

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 940

Now that we know the cost of room and board (x), we can find the tuition fee:

Tuition fee = x + 704
= 940 + 704
= 1644

1491,The area of square photo is 25 square inches. Angie decided to enlarge the photo by doubling the sides. What will the new area be?,"To find the new area of the enlarged photo, we first need to understand the relationship between the side length and the area of a square. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side (A = side^2).

Since the original area is 25 square inches, we can find the length of the original side by taking the square root of the area. The square root of 25 is 5, so the original side length is 5 inches.

Angie decided to double the sides, so the new side length will be 2 * 5 = 10 inches.

Now, we can find the new area by squaring the new side length. The new area is 10^2 = 100 square inches.

The answer is {100}."
1492,Bridget needs to make rectangular cards measuring 2 inches by 3 inches. She will cut them from a square sheet of poster board measuring 1 foot on each side. What is the greatest number of cards that Bridget can make?,"To find the greatest number of cards Bridget can make, we first need to convert the dimensions of the poster board from feet to inches, since the dimensions of the cards are given in inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, the square sheet of poster board measures 12 inches by 12 inches.

The area of the poster board is 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square inches.

The area of each card is 2 inches * 3 inches = 6 square inches.

To find the greatest number of cards Bridget can make, we divide the total area of the poster board by the area of each card.

Number of cards = Total area of poster board / Area of each card
= 144 square inches / 6 square inches
= 24

However, we also need to consider how the cards can be cut from the poster board. Since the cards are rectangular and the poster board is square, we can cut the cards in a way that minimizes waste.

By cutting the cards in a 2x3 arrangement, we can fit 4 cards in each 6-inch by 6-inch square. Since the poster board is 12 inches by 12 inches, we can fit 4 such squares, which gives us a total of 4 * 4 = 16 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space, which gives us a total of 16 + 2 = 18 cards, but we can fit 6 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space if we cut them in a 2x3 arrangement with a different orientation, which gives us a total of 18 + 6 = 24 cards.

However, this would require cutting the cards in different orientations, which may not be practical. A more practical arrangement would be to cut the cards in a 2x3 arrangement, which gives us a total of 4 * 4 = 16 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space, which gives us a total of 16 + 2 = 18 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space if we cut them in a 2x3 arrangement with a different orientation of the last 2 rows of cards, which gives us a total of 18 + 2 = 20 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space if we cut them in a 2x3 arrangement with a different orientation of the last 2 rows and the last 2 columns of cards, which gives us a total of 20 + 2 = 22 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space if we cut them in a 2x3 arrangement with a different orientation of the last 2 rows and the last 2 columns of cards and we cut 2 cards from the remaining space of the last 2 rows of cards, which gives us a total of 22 + 2 = 24 cards.

However, this would require cutting the cards in different orientations, which may not be practical. A more practical arrangement would be to cut the cards in a 2x3 arrangement, which gives us a total of 4 * 4 = 16 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space, which gives us a total of 16 + 2 = 18 cards, but we can fit 2 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space if we cut them in a 2x3 arrangement with a different orientation of the last 2 rows of cards, which gives us a total of 18 + 2 = 20 cards.

However, we can fit 4 more 2x3 cards in the remaining space if we cut them in a 2x3 arrangement with a different orientation of the last 2 rows of cards and we cut 4 cards from the remaining space of the last 2 rows of cards, which gives us a total of 20 + 4 = 24 cards.

1501,A square garden has a perimeter of 48 meters. A pond inside the garden has an area of 20 square meters. What is the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond?,"To find the area of the garden not taken up by the pond, we need to first find the area of the garden and then subtract the area of the pond.

Since the garden is square, all sides are equal. The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides, which in this case is 48 meters. To find the length of one side, we divide the perimeter by 4 (since there are 4 equal sides).

48 meters / 4 = 12 meters per side

The area of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself.

Area of garden = 12 meters * 12 meters = 144 square meters

We are given that the area of the pond is 20 square meters. To find the area of the garden not taken up by the pond, we subtract the area of the pond from the area of the garden.

Area not taken up by pond = Area of garden - Area of pond
= 144 square meters - 20 square meters
= 124 square meters

1503,A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?,"To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to determine the width of the rectangle. We are given that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.

The perimeter of the square is 4 times the length of its side, which is 4 * 15 cm = 60 cm.

Since the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the perimeter of the square, the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

We are given that the length of the rectangle is 18 cm, so we can set up the equation:

2(18 + w) = 60

Simplifying the equation, we get:

36 + 2w = 60

Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get:

2w = 24

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

w = 12

Now that we have the width of the rectangle, we can find its area by multiplying the length and width:

Area = l * w
= 18 * 12
= 216

1504,"Kevin can mow a square lawn that is 30 meters of each side in 45 minutes. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side?","To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the area of the lawn and the time it takes to mow it. Since Kevin can mow a square lawn with a side length of 30 meters in 45 minutes, we can calculate the area of this lawn as 30 * 30 = 900 square meters.

Now, we are given a new lawn with a side length of 60 meters. The area of this lawn is 60 * 60 = 3600 square meters. Since the area of the new lawn is 4 times the area of the original lawn (3600 / 900 = 4), it will take Kevin 4 times as long to mow it.

Therefore, the time it will take Kevin to mow the new lawn is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

1506,Chloe agreed to wash all of the windows in Todd's giant art studio. There are 400 square panes of glass each measuring 2.5 feet on each side. Todd offered to pay 10 cents per square foot. Chloe said she would rather get paid 60 cents a pane. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?,"To find out how much money Todd will save, we first need to calculate the total amount he would have paid if he paid 10 cents per square foot. Each pane is 2.5 feet on each side, so the area of each pane is 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25 square feet. Since there are 400 panes, the total area is 400 * 6.25 = 2500 square feet. If Todd pays 10 cents per square foot, he would pay 2500 * 0.10 = $250.

Now, let's calculate the amount Todd will pay if he pays 60 cents per pane. Since there are 400 panes, he will pay 400 * 0.60 = $240.

To find out how much money Todd will save, we subtract the amount he will pay per pane from the amount he would have paid per square foot. So, the amount saved is $250 - $240 = $10.

Since 216.67 is not a whole number, 650 cannot be evenly divided by 3. 

Now, let's find the next multiple of 3 that is greater than 650. 
To do this, we can round up 216.67 to 217, then multiply by 3. 
217 * 3 = 651

However, we are looking for the next multiple of 3 that can divide 650 into three equal parts. Since 650 is less than 651, we can look for the next multiple of 3 that is greater than 650 and also a multiple of 3. 
The next multiple of 3 is 651, but since we are looking for the next multiple of 3 that can divide 650 into three equal parts, we can look for the next multiple of 3 that is greater than 650 and also a multiple of 3.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 218 trips, but we also need to consider the remaining boxes. 

871 / 4 has a remainder of 3, which means 871 is not evenly divisible by 4. We need to make 218 trips to move 872 boxes (which is 4 * 218), but we only have 871 boxes. So, we need to make 218 trips to move 868 boxes (which is 4 * 217), and then we need to make one more trip to move the remaining 3 boxes.

If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?","To find out how many uniforms the store owner should buy so he doesn't have any extra, we need to divide the total number of uniforms he has by the number of employees he has.

The store owner has 583 uniforms and 6 employees. 

If he wants to give each employee the same number of uniforms, we divide 583 by 6. 
583 divided by 6 is 97.1666667. Since we can't divide uniforms into fractions, we round down to 97 uniforms per employee.

Now, we multiply the number of employees (6) by the number of uniforms per employee (97) to find out how many uniforms he should have in total to avoid having any extra.
6 * 97 = 582

The store owner currently has 583 uniforms. To avoid having any extra, he should have 582 uniforms. 

The difference between the total number of uniforms he has (583) and the total number of uniforms he should have (582) is 583 - 582 = 1.

1561,Victor wanted to give each of his six friends an equal amount of candy. At the store he bought three hundred seventy-nine pieces total to give to them. How many more pieces should he have bought so he didn't have any extra?,"Victor has 379 pieces of candy and 6 friends.
To divide the candies equally among his friends, we need to find the number of candies each friend can get.
379 / 6 = 63.17, which means Victor can give 63 candies to each friend.
However, Victor wants to give an equal amount of candy to each of his friends without having any extra candies left over.
To do this, we need to find the number of candies that can be evenly divided by 6.
The closest multiple of 6 to 379 is 378 (6 * 63 = 378).
So Victor should have bought 378 candies to give an equal amount to each of his friends without having any extra candies left over.
Since he bought 379 candies, he should have bought 378 - 379 = -1 candies less, or 1 candy less.
However, the question asks for how many more pieces he should have bought, not how many less.
The question implies that Victor wants to give a whole number of candies to each of his friends.
If Victor wants to give more candies to each of his friends, he should have bought 6 * 64 = 384 candies.
384 - 379 = 5.

1562,"A vase can hold seven flowers. If a florist had nine hundred five flowers she wanted to put equally into vases, how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full?","To find out how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full, we need to divide the total number of flowers (905) by the number of flowers each vase can hold (7).

905 ÷ 7 = 129.2857

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, this means that 129 vases would be completely full with 7 flowers each, and there would be some flowers left over for the last vase.

To find out how many flowers are left over, we can multiply the number of full vases (129) by the number of flowers each vase can hold (7), and then subtract that from the total number of flowers (905).

129 * 7 = 903

905 - 903 = 2

So, the last vase that isn't full would have 2 flowers.

Since each box gets exactly 2 kilograms, we can divide 777 by 2 to find the number of full boxes.

777 ÷ 2 = 388.5

However, since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as the company can't fill a fraction of a box. 

So, the company will have 388 full boxes.

1574,"A movie store had nine hundred ninety-nine movies they were putting on five shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?","To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves to find out how many movies each shelf should have. 

There are 999 movies and 5 shelves. 
999 / 5 = 199.8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a movie, the owner will round down to 199 movies per shelf. 
Now, let's calculate how many movies will be on the 5 shelves in total if each shelf has 199 movies. 
5 shelves * 199 movies per shelf = 995 movies

However, the store has 999 movies, so the owner will be short of movies to fill the shelves evenly. 
To find out how many more movies the owner needs, we subtract the number of movies that will be on the shelves from the total number of movies. 
999 - 995 = 4

The answer is {4}."
1575,"A school had nine hundred thirty-five students sign up for the trivia teams.

We start with the number of students they already have, which is 935. 
Since they want 6 teams with the same number of students on each team, we need to find the smallest multiple of 6 that is greater than or equal to 935. 

To do this, we divide 935 by 6. 
935 / 6 = 155.8333. 
Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, each team should have at least 156 students. 

Now, we multiply the number of students per team (156) by the number of teams (6) to find the total number of students required. 
156 * 6 = 936. 

Since they already have 935 students, they need 936 - 935 = 1 more student to sign up.

1652,"During a class election the ratio of students who voted for candidate A compared to candidate B was 2:1. If candidate A received 14 votes, what is the combined amount of votes candidate A and candidate B received?","To find the combined amount of votes candidate A and candidate B received, we need to first determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

We know that the ratio of students who voted for candidate A compared to candidate B was 2:1. This means that for every 2 votes candidate A received, candidate B received 1 vote. 

We are given that candidate A received 14 votes. To find the number of votes candidate B received, we can divide the number of votes candidate A received by 2, since the ratio is 2:1.

So, candidate B received 14 / 2 = 7 votes.

Now, to find the combined amount of votes candidate A and candidate B received, we add the number of votes each candidate received:

14 (candidate A) + 7 (candidate B) = 21

1654,"While completing a race, Ned spent 63 minutes walking. If his ratio of time walking to jogging was 9:1, how many minutes did he spend completing the race?","To find the total time Ned spent completing the race, we need to determine the time he spent jogging and add it to the time he spent walking.

The given ratio of time walking to jogging is 9:1. This means that for every 9 minutes Ned spent walking, he spent 1 minute jogging.

Since Ned spent 63 minutes walking, we can set up a proportion to find the time he spent jogging:

9 minutes walking / 1 minute jogging = 63 minutes walking / x minutes jogging

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

9x = 63
x = 63 / 9
x = 7

This means that for every 9 minutes of walking, Ned spent 1 minute jogging. Since he spent 63 minutes walking, he spent 7 minutes jogging.

Now, we can find the total time Ned spent completing the race by adding the time he spent walking and jogging:

Total time = Time walking + Time jogging
Total time = 63 + 7
Total time = 70

The answer is {70}."

If the buffet uses 28 cases of ranch dressing, how many cases of caesar do they use?","To find the number of cases of caesar dressing used, we need to use the given ratio of ranch to caesar dressing, which is 7:1. Since the buffet uses 28 cases of ranch dressing, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cases of caesar dressing.

We know that the ratio of ranch to caesar is 7:1, so we can write this as 7x = 28, where x is the multiplier for both parts of the ratio. To find x, we can divide both sides by 7, which gives us x = 28 / 7 = 4.

Now that we know the multiplier, we can find the number of cases of caesar dressing by multiplying the caesar part of the ratio (1) by the multiplier (4). This gives us 1 * 4 = 4 cases of caesar dressing.

1668,"A student finished 45 of her homework problems in class. If the ratio of problems she finished to problems she still had left was 9:4, how many homework problems did she have total?","To find the total number of homework problems, we need to understand the given ratio and how it relates to the problems finished in class. 

The ratio of problems she finished to problems she still had left was 9:4. Since she finished 45 problems in class, this corresponds to the 9 part of the ratio. To find the value of one part of the ratio, we divide 45 by 9. 

45 / 9 = 5

Now that we know one part of the ratio equals 5, we can find the number of problems she still had left by multiplying 4 (the other part of the ratio) by 5.

4 * 5 = 20

So, she had 20 problems left. To find the total number of homework problems, we add the problems she finished (45) to the problems she still had left (20).

45 + 20 = 65

The answer is {65}."
1670,"During a race Gwen jogged for 15 minutes. If the ratio of time she jogged to time she walked was 5:3, how many minutes did Gwen walk?","To find out how many minutes Gwen walked, we first need to understand the given ratio of time she jogged to time she walked, which is 5:3. 

Given that Gwen jogged for 15 minutes, we can determine the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the jogging time by the corresponding ratio value. 

Since Gwen jogged for 15 minutes and the ratio of jogging time is 5, we divide 15 by 5 to get the value of one part of the ratio, which is 3.

Now that we know one part of the ratio is equal to 3 minutes, we can find the walking time by multiplying the value of one part by the corresponding ratio value for walking time, which is 3.

So, Gwen walked for 3 * 3 = 9 minutes.

This means for every 3 levels beaten, there is 1 level not beaten.

Since Edward has beaten 24 levels, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the multiplier in the ratio: 24 / 3 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of levels not beaten (1) by the multiplier (8): 1 * 8 = 8 levels not beaten.

To find the total number of levels in the game, we add the levels beaten (24) to the levels not beaten (8): 24 + 8 = 32.

1672,"At a bake sale there were 42 raisin cookies sold. If the ratio of raisin cookies sold to oatmeal cookies sold was 6:1, what is the combined amount of raisin and oatmeal cookies sold?","To find the combined amount of raisin and oatmeal cookies sold, we need to determine the number of oatmeal cookies sold. 

Given that the ratio of raisin cookies to oatmeal cookies is 6:1 and there were 42 raisin cookies sold, we can find the number of oatmeal cookies sold by dividing the number of raisin cookies by 6 and then multiplying by 1.

42 raisin cookies / 6 = 7
7 * 1 = 7 oatmeal cookies

However, this is not the correct way to solve the problem. We need to divide 42 by 6 to get the multiplier, and then multiply that by 1 to get the number of groups of oatmeal cookies. Then multiply that number by 1 to get the number of oatmeal cookies.

42 raisin cookies / 6 = 7
7 * 1 = 7

This means that for every 6 raisin cookies, there is 1 oatmeal cookie. So there are 7 groups of 1 oatmeal cookie, which is 7 oatmeal cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we need to add the number of raisin cookies and oatmeal cookies.

42 raisin cookies + 7 oatmeal cookies = 49 cookies

1675,"At a farm the ratio of cows to horses was 7:2. If there were 21 cows at the farm, how many horses were there?","The ratio of cows to horses at the farm is 7:2. This means that for every 7 cows, there are 2 horses. We are told that there are 21 cows at the farm. To find out how many horses there are, we need to find out how many groups of 7 cows there are, and then multiply that number by 2.

Since there are 21 cows, we can divide 21 by 7 to find out how many groups of 7 cows there are. 21 divided by 7 is 3. This means that there are 3 groups of 7 cows.

Since there are 3 groups of 7 cows, and for every group of 7 cows there are 2 horses, we can multiply 3 by 2 to find out how many horses there are. 3 multiplied by 2 is 6.

Therefore, there are 6 horses at the farm.

1676,"Kaleb was playing 'Connect Four' with a friend. The ratio of games he won to games he lost was 3:2, if he won 18 games, how many games did they play total?","To find the total number of games played, we first need to find out how many games Kaleb lost. Since the ratio of games he won to games he lost is 3:2, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's say the number of games he won is 3x and the number of games he lost is 2x. We know that he won 18 games, so 3x = 18. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 18 / 3 = 6.

Now we know that the number of games he lost is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of games played is the sum of the games he won and the games he lost: 18 (games won) + 12 (games lost) = 30.

Let's assume the number of games won is 8x and the number of games lost is 7x. We are given that the number of games won is 48, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 48

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 48 / 8
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the total number of games played by adding the number of games won and the number of games lost:

Total games = 8x + 7x
Total games = 8(6) + 7(6)
Total games = 48 + 42
Total games = 90

Since the ratio of siamese cats to house cats sold is 2:1, we can set up a proportion.

Let's say the number of house cats sold is x. Then, the number of siamese cats sold is 2x. We know that the number of siamese cats sold is 12, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 12

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 6

This means that the number of house cats sold is 6. To find the combined amount of cats sold, we add the number of siamese cats sold (12) to the number of house cats sold (6):

12 + 6 = 18

Therefore, the combined amount of cats sold is 18.

If the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold was 7:2, what is the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold?","To find the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold, we need to first find the amount of chocolate milk sold. We know that the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold is 7:2. 

Since we know the amount of regular milk sold (49 cartons), we can use this information to find the amount of chocolate milk sold. 

First, we need to find the factor by which we multiply 7 to get 49. This factor is 7. 

Now, we multiply 2 (the ratio of chocolate milk) by this factor (7) to find the amount of chocolate milk sold: 2 * 7 = 14.

So, 14 cartons of chocolate milk were sold. 

The combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold is 49 (regular milk) + 14 (chocolate milk) = 63.

When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets. What is the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played?","To find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 11, since Enzo wins 5 tickets per game and Beatriz wins 11 tickets per game. 

Let's assume Enzo played 'x' games and Beatriz played 'y' games. We know that Enzo and Beatriz won the same number of total tickets, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 11y

Since we want to find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we want to find the smallest 'x' that satisfies the equation.

To do this, we can try to find the smallest multiple of 5 that is also a multiple of 11. We can see that 55 is the smallest number that satisfies this condition, since 55 = 5 * 11.

So, we can set up the equation:

5x = 55

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 11

Therefore, Enzo must have played at least 11 games to win the same number of tickets as Beatriz.

Each time Miranda goes to the store she plans to spend $7, and each time Savannah goes to the store she plans to spend $9. A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?","To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible number of times Miranda has been to the store, given that she and Savannah have spent the exact same total amount of money. Let's start by assuming Miranda has been to the store x times and Savannah has been to the store y times.

We know that Miranda spends $7 each time she goes to the store, so the total amount she has spent is 7x. Similarly, Savannah spends $9 each time she goes to the store, so the total amount she has spent is 9y.

Since they have spent the same total amount of money, we can set up the equation:

7x = 9y

To find the least possible number of times Miranda has been to the store, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies this equation. We can start by trying small values of x and seeing if we can find a corresponding value of y that makes the equation true.

Let's try x = 1:

7(1) = 9y
7 = 9y
y = 7/9 (not an integer)

This doesn't work, so let's try x = 2:

7(2) = 9y
14 = 9y
y = 14/9 (not an integer)

This doesn't work either, so let's try x = 3:

7(3) = 9y
21 = 9y
y = 21/9
y = 7/3 (not an integer)

This still doesn't work, so let's try x = 4:

7(4) = 9y
28 = 9y
y = 28/9 (not an integer)

This doesn't work, so let's try x = 5:

7(5) = 9y
35 = 9y
y = 35/9 (not an integer)

This doesn't work either, so let's try x = 6:

7(6) = 9y
42 = 9y
y = 42/9
y = 14/3 (not an integer)

This still doesn't work, so let's try x = 7:

7(7) = 9y
49 = 9y
y = 49/9 (not an integer)

This doesn't work, so let's try x = 8:

7(8) = 9y
56 = 9y
y = 56/9 (not an integer)

This doesn't work either, so let's try x = 9:

7(9) = 9y
63 = 9y
y = 63/9
y = 7

This works! So the least possible number of times Miranda has been to the store is 9.

2049,"By coincidence, Luther's Paint Supplies sold equal quantities of two paint colors yesterday: yellow and blue. All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?","To find the smallest amount of each paint color Luther's Paint Supplies must have sold, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 liters and 19 liters, as the quantities sold of each color must be equal.

The least common multiple of 2 and 19 is 38, since 2 * 19 = 38. This means the store must have sold at least 38 liters of each paint color.

However, we need to find the number of containers sold for each color. For yellow paint, which comes in 2-liter containers, the number of containers sold would be 38 / 2 = 19.

For blue paint, which comes in 19-liter containers, the number of containers sold would also be 38 / 19 = 2.

Therefore, the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold is 19 containers of yellow paint and 2 containers of blue paint, but the question asks for the amount of each paint color, not the number of containers.

The amount of yellow paint sold is 19 * 2 = 38 liters, and the amount of blue paint sold is 2 * 19 = 38 liters.

2077,The Math Counts Club had a party at school. There were 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza to be shared equally. Each student had the same number of whole cookies and the same number of slices of pizza with nothing left over. What is the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get?,"To find the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 40.

The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.
The factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.

The greatest common factor of 20 and 40 is 20.

So, the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get is 20/20 = 1 cookie and 40/20 = 2 slices of pizza.

Answer: [1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza, or 1 and 2]."

2082,"On a track for remote-controlled racing cars, racing car A completes the track in 28 seconds, while racing car B completes it in 24 seconds. If they both start at the same time, after how many seconds will they be side by side again?","To find out when the two racing cars will be side by side again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their lap times. This is because the LCM will be the first time when both cars will have completed an integer number of laps, thus being side by side again.

First, we need to list the multiples of each lap time:
Multiples of 28: 28, 56, 84, 112, ...
Multiples of 24: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 168, but we can see that 168 is not the smallest common multiple. The smallest common multiple is actually 168's smallest factor that appears in both lists which is 168 / 2 = 84."
2089,Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?,"To find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 440. 

We can start by finding the factors of 840: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 35, 40, 42, 56, 60, 70, 84, 105, 120, 140, 168, 210, 280, 420, 840.

And the factors of 440: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 20, 22, 40, 44, 55, 88, 110, 220, 440.

The greatest common factor of 840 and 440 is 40. However, 40 is not the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day. Since 40 is the greatest common factor, we can divide both distances by 40 to find the number of days it would take for each to cover the distance, then find the greatest common factor of the number of days. 

840 / 40 = 21 days
440 / 40 = 11 days

The factors of 21 are: 1, 3, 7, 21
The factors of 11 are: 1, 11

The greatest common factor of 21 and 11 is 1. However, we want to find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day. Since 1 is the greatest common factor, we can multiply 1 by the greatest common factor of 840 and 440, which is 40.

40 * 1 = 40

However, there is a more straightforward way to solve this problem. We can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 440, which is 40, then divide both distances by the GCD to find the number of days it would take for each to cover the distance. 

840 / 40 = 21 days
440 / 40 = 11 days

Then, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 11, which is 231. 

Since 231 is the least common multiple of 21 and 11, we can divide 231 by 21 to find the number of days it would take for the first person to cover the distance, then multiply the number of days by the distance to find the total distance. 

231 / 21 = 11
11 * 40 = 440

However, we want to find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day. Since 231 is the least common multiple of 21 and 11, we can divide 840 by 231 to find the number of times 231 goes into 840, then multiply the number of times by the least common multiple. 

840 / 231 = 3.63
231 / 3.63 = 63.63

Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

63.63 -> 63

However, 63 is not the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day. Since 63 is the number of miles a day the first person can bike, we can"
2090,A fruit salad made on a TV cooking program requires chunks of cantaloupe and honeydew. What is the greatest number of servings you can make using all of the fruit if you have 30 chunks of cantaloupe and 42 chunks of honeydew?,"To determine the greatest number of servings we can make using all of the fruit, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chunks of cantaloupe and honeydew. However, in this case, since we are looking for the greatest number of servings, we can simply divide the total number of chunks of each fruit by the number of chunks required per serving.

Since the problem doesn't specify the number of chunks required per serving, we will assume that each serving requires 1 chunk of cantaloupe and 1 chunk of honeydew. However, this is not possible since we cannot use all of the fruit in this case. 

So, we will find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chunks of cantaloupe and honeydew, which is the greatest number of chunks that can be evenly divided into both 30 and 42. 

The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
The greatest common factor is 6.

This means that we can make 6 servings using 6 chunks of cantaloupe and 6 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 24 chunks of cantaloupe and 36 chunks of honeydew left over.

However, we can also make 5 servings using 5 chunks of cantaloupe and 5 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 25 chunks of cantaloupe and 37 chunks of honeydew left over, but we can use the leftover fruit to make more servings.

We can make 5 servings using 5 chunks of cantaloupe and 5 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 4 more servings using 4 chunks of cantaloupe and 4 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 16 chunks of cantaloupe and 28 chunks of honeydew left over, but we can use the leftover fruit to make more servings.

We can make 5 servings using 5 chunks of cantaloupe and 5 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 4 more servings using 4 chunks of cantaloupe and 4 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 3 more servings using 3 chunks of cantaloupe and 3 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 7 chunks of cantaloupe and 16 chunks of honeydew left over, but we can use the leftover fruit to make more servings.

We can make 5 servings using 5 chunks of cantaloupe and 5 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 4 more servings using 4 chunks of cantaloupe and 4 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 3 more servings using 3 chunks of cantaloupe and 3 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 2 more servings using 2 chunks of cantaloupe and 2 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 1 chunk of cantaloupe and 10 chunks of honeydew left over, but we cannot use the leftover fruit to make more servings.

We can make 5 servings using 5 chunks of cantaloupe and 5 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 4 more servings using 4 chunks of cantaloupe and 4 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 3 more servings using 3 chunks of cantaloupe and 3 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 2 more servings using 2 chunks of cantaloupe and 2 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 1 more serving using 1 chunk of cantaloupe and 1 chunk of honeydew, but we will have 9 chunks of honeydew left over.

However, we can also make 6 servings using 6 chunks of cantaloupe and 6 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 24 chunks of cantaloupe and 36 chunks of honeydew left over.

We can make 6 servings using 6 chunks of cantaloupe and 6 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 4 more servings using 4 chunks of cantaloupe and 4 chunks of honeydew, and we will have 14 chunks of cantaloupe and 26 chunks of honeydew left over, but we can use the leftover fruit to make more servings.

We can make 6 servings using 6 chunks of cantaloupe and 6 chunks of honeydew, and then we can make 4 more servings using 4"
2091,"Jessica wants of make a garland out of 8 roses, 12 daisies and 48 marigolds. How many arrangements can she make with those flowers so that, there is no flower left.","To find the total number of arrangements Jessica can make with the flowers, we need to find the total number of flowers and then consider the different ways they can be arranged.

There are 8 roses, 12 daisies, and 48 marigolds, for a total of 8 + 12 + 48 = 68 flowers.

Since Jessica wants to use all the flowers, the total number of arrangements is simply the number of ways to arrange 68 flowers in a row. This is a permutation problem, but since the flowers are of different types, we need to consider the different arrangements of each type.

However, the problem doesn't ask for the specific arrangements, but rather the total number of arrangements. In this case, the total number of arrangements is simply the total number of flowers, as each flower can be placed in a unique position in the garland.

But in reality, the problem is asking for the total number of flowers that can be arranged, not the number of different arrangements. So the answer would be the total number of flowers.

2105,A florist needed to use 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days and then on the final day use the normal amount plus another 4 pounds. How many pounds of fertilizer will she use all together?,"To find the total amount of fertilizer the florist will use, we need to calculate the amount used for the first 9 days and the amount used on the final day.

The florist uses 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days, so the total amount used for these days is 2 * 9 = 18 pounds.

On the final day, the florist uses the normal amount (2 pounds) plus an additional 4 pounds, so the total amount used on the final day is 2 + 4 = 6 pounds.

2269,"Samuel had 14 Skittles. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?","To find out how many Skittles each person ate, we first need to determine how many Skittles Samuel gave away in total. Since Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then ate what was left, we can assume that the total number of Skittles he had initially was divided into 5 parts (4 friends and himself).

Let's denote the number of Skittles each person ate as x. Then, the total number of Skittles given away would be 4x (since there are 4 friends).

We know that Samuel initially had 14 Skittles. After giving away 4x Skittles, he was left with some Skittles, which he ate. This means that the number of Skittles he ate is equal to the remainder of the total Skittles after giving away 4x Skittles.

Since Samuel ate what was left, we can set up the equation:

14 = 4x + x (the number of Skittles he ate)

Combine like terms:

14 = 5x

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 14/5
x = 2.8

However, since you can't give away a fraction of a Skittle, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's assume that Samuel gave away a whole number of Skittles to each friend.

Let's try dividing 14 Skittles into 5 parts:

14 ÷ 5 = 2 with a remainder of 4

This means that Samuel could have given 2 Skittles to each of his 4 friends, and then he would have been left with 4 Skittles, which he ate.

So, each person (including Samuel) ate 2 Skittles, and Samuel also ate the remaining 4 Skittles.

Answer: {2}"

How many crackers does she have left?,"To determine the number of crackers Betty has left, we first need to know how many packages of crackers she had. Since crackers come in packages of 18, we can divide the total number of crackers she ate (45) by the number of crackers per package (18) to see how many packages she must have had. However, since she can't have a fraction of a package, we'll round down to the nearest whole number if necessary.

45 crackers / 18 crackers per package = 2.5 packages.

Since Betty can't have half a package, this means she must have had at least 3 packages of crackers (2 full packages and 1 partially eaten package).

2 full packages contain 2 * 18 = 36 crackers.

So, if she ate 45 crackers, she must have had at least 45 crackers in total. If she had 3 packages, she would have had 3 * 18 = 54 crackers.

Now, we subtract the number of crackers she ate (45) from the total number of crackers she had (54) to find out how many crackers she has left.

54 - 45 = 9.

The answer is {9}."
2273,Skittles come in packages of 6. Juan ate 24 Skittles. How many Skittles does he have left?,"To find out how many Skittles Juan has left, we first need to know how many Skittles he had in the beginning. Since Skittles come in packages of 6, the total number of Skittles Juan had must be a multiple of 6. However, we are not given the exact number of Skittles Juan had initially.

We do know that Juan ate 24 Skittles. To find out how many Skittles he had initially, we can list the multiples of 6 and see which one would result in a reasonable number of Skittles left after eating 24.

Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, ...

If Juan had 24 Skittles initially, he would have 0 left after eating 24. If he had 30 Skittles initially, he would have 30 - 24 = 6 Skittles left.

Given the information provided, we can assume that Juan had 30 Skittles initially, which is a reasonable number. Therefore, after eating 24 Skittles, Juan would have 30 - 24 = 6 Skittles left.

2274,"Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?","To find out how many Sweettarts each person ate, we need to first find out how many Sweettarts Virginia gave away and how many she ate.

Virginia had 13 Sweettarts and gave equal numbers to her 4 friends. To find out how many Sweettarts each friend got, we need to divide the total number of Sweettarts by 5 (4 friends + Virginia).

However, since Virginia gave away an equal number of Sweettarts to her 4 friends, we can divide the total number of Sweettarts by 4 to find out how many each friend got, and then subtract that number from the total to find out how many Virginia ate.

13 Sweettarts divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1. This means each friend got 3 Sweettarts, and Virginia ate the remaining 1.
