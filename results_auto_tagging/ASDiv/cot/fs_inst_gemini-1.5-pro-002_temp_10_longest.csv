161,I have 28 cents in my pocket. How coins could I have on minimization?,"To minimize the number of coins, we should use the largest denominations possible.

First, we check if we can use quarters (25 cents).  28 cents can be made with one quarter (25 cents) and 3 pennies (3 cents). This gives us a total of 1 + 3 = 4 coins.

Next, we check if we can use fewer coins without quarters.
Using only dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cents), we can try different combinations:

* Two dimes (20 cents) + 1 nickel (5 cents) + 3 pennies (3 cents) = 28 cents.  This gives us 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 coins, which is more than 4.
* One dime (10 cents) + 3 nickels (15 cents) + 3 pennies = 28 cents. This gives us 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 coins, which is more than 4.
* No dimes, six nickels (30 cents). This is more than 28 cents.
* Twenty-eight pennies. This clearly is not minimal.

The combination with one quarter, and three pennies gives us the smallest number of coins.

673,19 children take a minibus to the zoo. They are to sit 2 or 3 to a seat. There are 7 seats. How many seats will have 3 children seated on them?,"Let $x$ be the number of seats with 2 children and $y$ be the number of seats with 3 children.
We know that there are 7 seats in total, so $x + y = 7$.
We also know that there are 19 children in total. So, $2x + 3y = 19$.

We have a system of two linear equations with two variables:
1) $x + y = 7$
2) $2x + 3y = 19$

From equation (1), we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = 7 - y$.
Substitute this expression for $x$ into equation (2):
$2(7 - y) + 3y = 19$
$14 - 2y + 3y = 19$
$y = 19 - 14$
$y = 5$

Now, substitute $y = 5$ back into the equation $x = 7 - y$:
$x = 7 - 5$
$x = 2$

So, there are 2 seats with 2 children each and 5 seats with 3 children each.

785,There are 22 dogs in the farm. They live in 5 dog-houses equally. How many dogs are there in each dog-house?,"Since there are 22 dogs and 5 dog-houses, and the dogs are divided equally among the dog-houses, we can find the number of dogs in each dog-house by dividing the total number of dogs by the number of dog-houses: 22 dogs / 5 dog-houses = 4 dogs per dog-house with a remainder of 2 dogs. Since we can't have parts of dogs, it's implied that some dog-houses must house more dogs than others.  However, the question says they live in the dog-houses ""equally"". This implies the most even distribution possible. Two dog houses will have one extra dog each. So, 2 dog-houses will have 4+1=5 dogs each. The other 3 will just have 4 dogs each.

In total there are (5*2) + (4*3) = 10 + 12 = 22 dogs, which checks out. Since the question asks how many dogs are *in each* dog-house, and doesn't specify *most* or explicitly state all houses have the same number, we must use the most even distribution we found.

Answer: {4} (Most dog-houses will have 4, although 2 will have 5)

The remaining 2 students would then need to be distributed amongst the groups, meaning some groups will have more than others. The problem specifies ""5 equal groups,"" but this is not possible with 32 students. The closest answer is 6 students per group with 2 left over.

Answer: {6 R 2}

793,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?","Let $L$ be the number of large barrels used and $S$ be the number of small barrels used. We want to minimize the total number of barrels $L+S$ such that $6L + 5S = 95$, where $L$ and $S$ are non-negative integers.

We can express $S$ in terms of $L$ as follows:
$5S = 95 - 6L$
$S = \frac{95 - 6L}{5} = 19 - \frac{6}{5}L$

Since $S$ must be an integer, $95 - 6L$ must be divisible by 5.
This means that $6L$ must have a remainder of 0 when divided by 5.
Since $6L \equiv L \pmod{5}$, $L$ must be a multiple of 5.

We can test values of $L$ that are multiples of 5:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $L=0$, $S = \frac{95}{5} = 19$. Total barrels: $0+19=19$.
    \item If $L=5$, $S = \frac{95-30}{5} = \frac{65}{5} = 13$. Total barrels: $5+13=18$.
    \item If $L=10$, $S = \frac{95-60}{5} = \frac{35}{5} = 7$. Total barrels: $10+7=17$.
    \item If $L=15$, $S = \frac{95-90}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1$. Total barrels: $15+1=16$.
\end{itemize}
If we try $L=20$, we get $95 - 6(20) = 95 - 120 = -25$. Since $S$ must be non-negative, $L$ cannot be greater than 15.

The least number of barrels is achieved when $L=15$ and $S=1$, giving a total of 16 barrels.

794,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?","Let L be the number of large barrels and S be the number of small barrels.
We are given that the total amount of oil is 95 tons.
We want to minimize the total number of barrels, which is L + S.
We have the equation 6L + 5S = 95.
We can express S in terms of L as follows:
5S = 95 - 6L
S = (95 - 6L)/5
S = 19 - (6/5)L
Since S must be an integer, 95 - 6L must be divisible by 5. This means that 6L must leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 5.
We can test values of L starting from 0.
If L = 0, S = 19. Total barrels = 19.
If L = 1, S = (95-6)/5 = 89/5 = 17.8, not an integer.
If L = 2, S = (95-12)/5 = 83/5 = 16.6, not an integer.
If L = 3, S = (95-18)/5 = 77/5 = 15.4, not an integer.
If L = 4, S = (95-24)/5 = 71/5 = 14.2, not an integer.
If L = 5, S = (95-30)/5 = 65/5 = 13. Total barrels = 5 + 13 = 18.
If L = 10, S = (95-60)/5 = 35/5 = 7. Total barrels = 10 + 7 = 17.
If L = 15, S = (95-90)/5 = 5/5 = 1. Total barrels = 15+1 = 16.
We want to minimize L+S, so we want to maximize L.
Since 6L + 5S = 95, the maximum value of L occurs when S is minimized. The smallest possible integer value for S is 1.
6L + 5(1) = 95
6L = 90
L = 15
So, we can use 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel. The total number of barrels is 16.

795,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?","Let $L$ be the number of long pieces and $S$ be the number of short pieces.
The total length of the rope is 27 yards.
The length of each long piece is 4 yards, and the length of each short piece is 1 yard.
So, we have the equation: $4L + S = 27$.
We want to minimize the total number of pieces, which is $L + S$.
From the equation $4L + S = 27$, we can express $S$ in terms of $L$: $S = 27 - 4L$.
The total number of pieces is $N = L + S = L + (27 - 4L) = 27 - 3L$.
To minimize $N$, we want to maximize $L$.
Since $S$ must be non-negative, $27 - 4L \ge 0$, so $4L \le 27$, which means $L \le \frac{27}{4} = 6.75$.
Since $L$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $L$ is 6.
If $L=6$, then $S = 27 - 4(6) = 27 - 24 = 3$.
The total number of pieces is $6 + 3 = 9$.
If $L=5$, then $S = 27 - 4(5) = 27 - 20 = 7$.
The total number of pieces is $5 + 7 = 12$.
If $L=0$, then $S=27$, and the total number of pieces is 27.
So, to minimize the number of pieces, we should cut 6 long pieces and 3 short pieces.

796,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many short pieces should be cut for?","Let L be the number of long pieces and S be the number of short pieces.
The total length of the rope is 27 yards.
The length of each long piece is 4 yards, and the length of each short piece is 1 yard.
So, the total length equation is 4L + S = 27.
We want to minimize the total number of pieces, which is L + S.

From the equation 4L + S = 27, we can express S in terms of L:
S = 27 - 4L

The number of pieces is L + S = L + (27 - 4L) = 27 - 3L.
To minimize the number of pieces, we need to maximize L.

Since L must be a non-negative integer, we find the largest integer L such that S is also a non-negative integer.
If L = 0, S = 27.  Total pieces = 27.
If L = 1, S = 27 - 4 = 23.  Total pieces = 24.
If L = 2, S = 27 - 8 = 19.  Total pieces = 21.
If L = 3, S = 27 - 12 = 15.  Total pieces = 18.
If L = 4, S = 27 - 16 = 11.  Total pieces = 15.
If L = 5, S = 27 - 20 = 7.  Total pieces = 12.
If L = 6, S = 27 - 24 = 3.  Total pieces = 9.

If we continue increasing L, we have:
L = 6, S = 3
4L + S = 24 + 3 = 27.
Number of pieces = L + S = 6 + 3 = 9.

If L = 7, then S = -1, which is not allowed.

So the least number of pieces is 9, when L=6 and S=3.

797,15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will each of them get?,"Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students:** 122 portfolios / 15 students = 8.133 portfolios per student.

2. **Consider the whole number:** Since portfolios can't be split into fractions, each student will receive 8 complete portfolios.

3. **Calculate the remainder:**  There will be some portfolios left over. To find the remainder, multiply the whole number of portfolios per student (8) by the number of students (15): 8 * 15 = 120.

4. **Find the difference:**  Subtract this number from the original total of portfolios: 122 - 120 = 2.  There will be 2 portfolios left over.

Each student will receive 8 portfolios, and there will be 2 left over. The question asks how many portfolios each student will get, so the answer is 8.

801,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?","Let L be the number of large trucks and S be the number of small trucks. We want to minimize L + S subject to 15L + 7S = 134.
We also want each truck to be fully occupied. We can try different values of L and see if S is an integer.

If L = 1, 15 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 119 and S = 17. So (1, 17) is a solution.
If L = 2, 30 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 104, and S is not an integer.
If L = 3, 45 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 89, and S is not an integer.
If L = 4, 60 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 74, and S is not an integer.
If L = 5, 75 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 59, and S is not an integer.
If L = 6, 90 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 44, and S is not an integer.
If L = 7, 105 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 29, and S is not an integer.
If L = 8, 120 + 7S = 134, so 7S = 14 and S = 2. So (8, 2) is a solution.
If L = 9, 135 + 7S = 134, which is impossible.

We want to minimize L+S. In the first case, L+S = 1+17 = 18.
In the second case, L+S = 8+2 = 10.

Therefore, the least number of trucks is 10, and the number of large trucks used is 8.

We want to minimize L + S subject to 15L + 7S = 134.
We can try different values of L.

If L = 0, then 7S = 134, which has no integer solution.
If L = 1, then 7S = 134 - 15 = 119, S = 17.
If L = 2, then 7S = 134 - 30 = 104, which has no integer solution.
If L = 3, then 7S = 134 - 45 = 89, which has no integer solution.
If L = 4, then 7S = 134 - 60 = 74, which has no integer solution.
If L = 5, then 7S = 134 - 75 = 59, which has no integer solution.
If L = 6, then 7S = 134 - 90 = 44, which has no integer solution.
If L = 7, then 7S = 134 - 105 = 29, which has no integer solution.
If L = 8, then 7S = 134 - 120 = 14, S = 2.

So, we have two possible solutions:
1. L = 1, S = 17.  Total trucks = 18.
2. L = 8, S = 2.  Total trucks = 10.

Since we want to minimize the number of trucks used, we choose L = 8 and S = 2.
Therefore, the number of small trucks used is 2.

805,"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?","Let L be the number of large rooms and S be the number of small rooms.
We are given that there are 26 people in the tourist group.
Each large room can accommodate 3 people, and each small room can accommodate 2 people.
We want to minimize the total number of rooms, which is L + S, subject to the constraint that all 26 people are accommodated.
The equation representing the total number of people is 3L + 2S = 26.
We want to find non-negative integer solutions for L and S that minimize L + S.

We can rewrite the equation as 2S = 26 - 3L. Since 2S must be an even number, 26 - 3L must also be even.
If L = 0, 2S = 26, so S = 13. Total rooms = 0 + 13 = 13.
If L = 2, 2S = 26 - 6 = 20, so S = 10. Total rooms = 2 + 10 = 12.
If L = 4, 2S = 26 - 12 = 14, so S = 7. Total rooms = 4 + 7 = 11.
If L = 6, 2S = 26 - 18 = 8, so S = 4. Total rooms = 6 + 4 = 10.
If L = 8, 2S = 26 - 24 = 2, so S = 1. Total rooms = 8 + 1 = 9.
If L > 8, then 3L > 24, so 2S = 26 - 3L < 2, which means S would have to be less than 1, which is not possible since S must be a non-negative integer.

Thus, the least number of rooms is 9, which occurs when L = 8 and S = 1.

806,"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?","Let L be the number of large rooms and S be the number of small rooms.
We want to minimize the total number of rooms, L + S, subject to the constraint that 3L + 2S = 26.
We can express S in terms of L: 2S = 26 - 3L, so S = (26 - 3L)/2 = 13 - (3/2)L.
Since L and S must be integers, we need 26 - 3L to be an even number. This means that 3L must be even, which implies L must be even.

We can try different even values for L:
- If L = 0, S = (26 - 0)/2 = 13, and L+S = 13.
- If L = 2, S = (26 - 6)/2 = 10, and L+S = 12.
- If L = 4, S = (26 - 12)/2 = 7, and L+S = 11.
- If L = 6, S = (26 - 18)/2 = 4, and L+S = 10.
- If L = 8, S = (26 - 24)/2 = 1, and L+S = 9.

If we continue increasing L, we will get negative values for S.
The least number of rooms is 9, which occurs when L=8 and S=1.
Another way to think about it is to start with all small rooms. If we have all small rooms, we would have 26/2 = 13 rooms.
We can replace two small rooms with one large room, reducing the number of rooms by 1. If we replace 2 small rooms with 1 large room, we reduce the number of people housed by 1. Since we have 26 people and small rooms can house 2 each, then we can have a maximum of 13 small rooms.

If we try replacing two small rooms with a large room, we decrease the capacity by 1. We need to reduce the number of people by 26-24=2. This requires us to replace 2x2 = 4 small rooms with 2 large rooms and 2 small rooms.
Then, 2 x 3 + 10 x 2 = 6+20 = 26. We have 2+10 = 12 rooms.
If we use 4 large rooms and 7 small rooms, 4 x 3 + 7 x 2 = 12 + 14 = 26 people. 4 + 7 = 11 rooms.
If we use 6 large rooms and 4 small rooms, 6 x 3 + 4 x 2 = 18 + 8 = 26 people. 6 + 4 = 10 rooms.
If we use 8 large rooms and 1 small room, 8 x 3 + 1 x 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 people. 8 + 1 = 9 rooms.
This gives the minimum number of rooms.

809,"A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?","Let L be the number of large groups and S be the number of small groups. We have the equation 7L + 3S = 90. We want to minimize the total number of groups, L + S.

We can express S in terms of L:
3S = 90 - 7L
S = (90 - 7L)/3
S = 30 - (7/3)L

Since S must be a non-negative integer, we must have 90 - 7L divisible by 3.
We also want to minimize L+S = L + 30 - (7/3)L = 30 - (4/3)L.
Since the coefficient of L is negative, to minimize the total number of groups, we want to maximize L.

We test values of L starting from the largest possible value.
If L = 12, 7L = 84, 90-84 = 6, which is divisible by 3. S = 6/3 = 2. L+S = 14.

If L=9, then 90-7(9)=90-63=27. 27/3=9, so S=9 and L+S=18.

If L=6, then 90-7(6)=90-42=48. 48/3=16, so S=16 and L+S=22.

If L=3, then 90-7(3)=90-21=69. 69/3=23, so S=23 and L+S=26.

If L=0, then 90-7(0)=90. 90/3=30, so S=30 and L+S=30.

The maximum value of L for which 90-7L is a non-negative multiple of 3 is L=12. In this case, S=2, and the total number of groups is 14.
Therefore, to minimize the total number of groups, the number of large groups should be 12.

In order to make the least number of groups, how many small groups should be made?","Let L be the number of large groups and S be the number of small groups. We are given that there are 90 members in total.
So, 7L + 3S = 90.
We want to minimize the total number of groups, which is L + S.

From the equation 7L + 3S = 90, we can express L in terms of S:
7L = 90 - 3S
L = (90 - 3S)/7

Since L and S must be integers, we need to find integer values of S such that 90 - 3S is divisible by 7.
We can rewrite the equation as:
L = (84 + 6 - 3S)/7 = 12 + (6 - 3S)/7

We are looking for an integer value of (6 - 3S)/7, which means 6 - 3S must be a multiple of 7. Let's test some values of S:
If S = 0, 6-3(0) = 6, not divisible by 7.
If S = 1, 6-3(1) = 3, not divisible by 7.
If S = 2, 6-3(2) = 0, divisible by 7.
Then L = 12 + 0 = 12. So, L+S = 12+2 = 14.

If S = 9, 6-3(9) = -21, divisible by 7.
Then L = 12 + (-21)/7 = 12 - 3 = 9. So, L+S = 9+9=18.

If S = 16, 6-3(16) = -42, divisible by 7.
Then L = 12 + (-42)/7 = 12 - 6 = 6. So, L+S = 6+16=22.

We can see a pattern here. As S increases, L+S increases as well. So, the minimum value of L+S is 14, and we must have 2 small groups.

817,"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?","The library wants to shelve 4305 books equally onto 83 shelves.
First, find out how many books fit on each shelf: 4305 / 83 = 51 books with a remainder of 72.
So, 51 books fit evenly on each shelf, but there are 72 books left over.
If the library wants to fill the remaining space on the shelves, they need to purchase enough books so there are 83 books left over, rather than just 72.
The number of additional books they need to buy is 83 - 72 = 11 books.

819,"Betty has 367 beads and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?","Betty has 367 beads and wants to make 15 necklaces. If each necklace has the same number of beads, she would need 367 / 15 = 24.466... beads per necklace. Since she can only use whole beads, she can put 24 beads on each necklace. This uses 24 * 15 = 360 beads. She has 367 - 360 = 7 beads leftover. Since she wants to use *all* the beads and have the same number on each necklace, she needs enough beads so that each necklace has 25 beads. This means she needs 25 * 15 = 375 beads in total. She currently has 367 beads, so she needs 375 - 367 = 8 more beads.

820,"There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?","First find the minimum number of pudding cups required for each student to have an equal amount.  Since we can only have whole cups of pudding, we divide 315 by 218 and round up to the nearest whole number: 315/218 ≈ 1.45, so we round up to 2.

Since each of the 218 students wants 2 pudding cups, they need a total of 218*2 = 436 pudding cups.
Since they only have 315 cups, they need an additional 436 - 315 = 121 cups.

822,"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?","Explanation:
First, we divide the total number of chairs (1093) by the number of classrooms (35) to find out how many chairs each classroom gets: 1093 / 35 = 31 with a remainder of 8.
This means each classroom can get 31 chairs, and there will be 8 chairs left over.
To distribute the chairs equally, we want to find the next multiple of 35 that is greater than 1093.  Since each classroom gets 31 chairs, 35 classrooms would need 35 * 31 = 1085 chairs.
Since they have 1093, there are 1093-1085 = 8 extra chairs.
If we give each classroom 32 chairs, the school needs a total of 35*32 = 1120 chairs.
Therefore, the number of additional chairs needed is 1120 - 1093 = 27.

4 glass bottles weigh 4 bottles * 200g/bottle = 800g.

1 kg 50g is equal to 1000g + 50g = 1050g.

The weight of 5 plastic bottles is the total weight minus the weight of the glass bottles: 1050g - 800g = 250g.
So each plastic bottle weighs 250g / 5 bottles = 50g.

The difference in weight is 200g (glass) - 50g (plastic) = 150g.

890,"London is 11 years old and Blair is 16 years old. Several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London. How old was London then?","Let L be London's current age and B be Blair's current age. We are given that L = 11 and B = 16.
Let x be the number of years ago when Blair was twice as old as London.
At that time, London's age was L - x and Blair's age was B - x.
We are given that Blair's age was twice London's age at that time, so we have the equation:
B - x = 2(L - x)
Substitute the given values of L and B:
16 - x = 2(11 - x)
16 - x = 22 - 2x
2x - x = 22 - 16
x = 6
So, 6 years ago, Blair was twice as old as London.
London's age then was L - x = 11 - 6 = 5 years old.

891,Anna has a total of 28 nickels and dimes in her piggy bank. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. How many dimes does Anna have?,"Let 'n' be the number of nickels and 'd' be the number of dimes.
We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of nickels and dimes is 28: n + d = 28
2. Anna has 8 fewer nickels than dimes: n = d - 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(d - 8) + d = 28
2d - 8 = 28
2d = 36
d = 18

So Anna has 18 dimes.

904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"Let's denote the number of apples in the first, second, and third bags as A, B, and C, respectively. We are given the following information:

* A + B + C = 24
* A + B = 11
* B + C = 18

We want to find the value of A + C.

We can find the number of apples in the second bag (B) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
(A + B + C) - (A + B) = C
24 - 11 = C
C = 13

Now we can find the number of apples in the first bag (A) by using the equation A + B = 11:
A + B = 11
A + (18 - C) = 11 since B + C = 18 => B = 18-C
A + (18 - 13) = 11
A + 5 = 11
A = 6

Now we have the number of apples in the first bag (A = 6) and the third bag (C = 13).  We want to find the sum A + C:
A + C = 6 + 13 = 19

906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","Rita and Peter weigh the same, let's say 'x' pounds each.
Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together.
Rita, Peter, and Skeeter weigh 90 pounds altogether.

So, Rita + Peter + Skeeter = 90
Since Rita and Peter weigh the same, we can rewrite this as:
x + x + Skeeter = 90
2x + Skeeter = 90

We also know that Peter + Skeeter = 68. Since Peter weighs 'x' pounds, we can rewrite this as:
x + Skeeter = 68

Now we have two equations:
1) 2x + Skeeter = 90
2) x + Skeeter = 68

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
(2x + Skeeter) - (x + Skeeter) = 90 - 68
x = 22

So, Peter and Rita each weigh 22 pounds.
Since Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together, and Peter weighs 22 pounds, Skeeter weighs:
68 - 22 = 46 pounds.

910,A box of apples was delivered to Paul's Pies and Cakes. He put half of the apples aside for a pie he would make later. He put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator. That left 6 apples to use in his muffins. How many apples were in the box at first?,"Let 'x' be the total number of apples in the box.
Paul put aside half of the apples, which is x/2.
The remaining apples are x - x/2 = x/2.
He put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator, so x/2 - 25 apples were left.
He had 6 apples left for muffins, so x/2 - 25 = 6.
Adding 25 to both sides of the equation, we get x/2 = 6 + 25 = 31.
Multiplying both sides by 2, we find x = 31 * 2 = 62.

Tara has $4 more than Megan, so Tara has x + $4.
Together, they have enough money to buy the scooter, which costs $26. So, x + (x + $4) = $26.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + $4 = $26.
Subtracting $4 from both sides, we have 2x = $22.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = $11.
This means Megan has $11.
Tara has $4 more than Megan, so Tara has $11 + $4 = $15.

Each box of bar soap contains 5 bars, so the total number of bars sold is 5x.
Each box of bottled soap contains 19 bottles, so the total number of bottles sold is 19y.
We are given that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles, so 5x = 19y.
We want to find the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold. This means we are looking for the smallest positive integer values of x and y that satisfy the equation 5x = 19y.

1085,Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?,"Let 'q' be the number of quarters and 'd' be the number of dimes.
We are given that the total value of the coins is $1.20.  We can express this as an equation:
0.25q + 0.10d = 1.20
We want to minimize the total number of coins, which is q + d. Since quarters have a higher value, we want to maximize the number of quarters.

We can test values of 'q' starting from the maximum possible number of quarters.
If q = 4, then 0.25 * 4 + 0.10d = 1.20, which means 1 + 0.10d = 1.20, so 0.10d = 0.20, and d = 2. This gives a total of 4 + 2 = 6 coins.

If q = 3, then 0.25 * 3 + 0.10d = 1.20, which means 0.75 + 0.10d = 1.20, so 0.10d = 0.45, and d = 4.5.  Since we can only have whole numbers of coins, this is not a valid solution.

If q = 2, then 0.25 * 2 + 0.10d = 1.20, which means 0.50 + 0.10d = 1.20, so 0.10d = 0.70, and d = 7. This gives a total of 2 + 7 = 9 coins.

If q = 1, then 0.25 * 1 + 0.10d = 1.20, which means 0.25 + 0.10d = 1.20, so 0.10d = 0.95, and d = 9.5, which is not a valid solution.

If q = 0, then 0.10d = 1.20, so d = 12. This gives a total of 12 coins.
The minimum number of coins is 6.

Adults are seated in groups of 17, so A must be a multiple of 17.
Children are seated in groups of 15, so C must be a multiple of 15.
We are given that the number of adults and children are the same, so A = C.
Therefore, we need to find the smallest number that is both a multiple of 17 and a multiple of 15. This is the least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 15.
Since 17 and 15 are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), their LCM is simply their product: LCM(17, 15) = 17 * 15 = 255.

1217,"Monroe Vitamin Shop sold equal quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements this morning, even though the Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7 and the Vitamin D supplements in packs of 17. What is the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold?","Explanation:
Let 'x' be the number of packs of Vitamin A supplements sold.
Let 'y' be the number of packs of Vitamin D supplements sold.

Since Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7, the total number of Vitamin A supplements sold is 7x.
Since Vitamin D supplements come in packs of 17, the total number of Vitamin D supplements sold is 17y.

We are given that the store sold equal quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements. Therefore, 7x = 17y.
We need to find the smallest positive integers x and y that satisfy this equation. Since 7 and 17 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the smallest values for x and y that satisfy the equation are x = 17 and y = 7.

Therefore, the smallest number of Vitamin A supplements sold is 7 * 17 = 119.
The smallest number of Vitamin D supplements sold is 17 * 7 = 119.

1218,"Amanda and Sadie each have a band. Amanda's band plays songs in sets of 2 and Sadie's band plays songs in sets of 9. After performing together, both bands realize that they have played the same number of songs. What is the smallest number of songs each band could have performed?","Let 'x' be the number of sets Amanda's band played and 'y' be the number of sets Sadie's band played.
Amanda's band plays 2 songs per set, so they played a total of 2x songs.
Sadie's band plays 9 songs per set, so they played a total of 9y songs.

Since they played the same number of songs, we have the equation 2x = 9y.
We want to find the smallest number of songs each band could have played, which means we need to find the smallest positive integer values for x and y that satisfy the equation.

We can rewrite the equation as x = (9/2)y.  Since x must be an integer, y must be a multiple of 2. Let's try the smallest multiple of 2 for y, which is 2.

If y = 2, then x = (9/2)*2 = 9.

So, Amanda's band played 2 * 9 = 18 songs, and Sadie's band played 9 * 2 = 18 songs.

Miguel is 4 years older than thrice his son's age, so Miguel's age is 3x + 4.
We are given that Miguel is 46 years old. So, we can set up the equation:
3x + 4 = 46
Subtract 4 from both sides:
3x = 46 - 4

1294,"Pete, Bryan and Philip are cousins. Pete's age is one-third of Bryan and Philip is five years elder than Bryan. If the sum of the age of the cousins is 40, find the ages of each.","Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'P' represent Pete's age.
* Let 'B' represent Bryan's age.
* Let 'H' represent Philip's age.

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

* P = B/3  (Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's)
* H = B + 5 (Philip is five years older than Bryan)
* P + B + H = 40 (The sum of their ages is 40)

**Solve the equations:**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   (B/3) + B + (B + 5) = 40

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   (B/3) + 2B + 5 = 40

3. **Subtract** 5 from both sides:
   (B/3) + 2B = 35

4. **Multiply** both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
    B + 6B = 105

5. **Combine** like terms:
    7B = 105

6. **Divide** both sides by 7:
    B = 15

7. **Substitute** the value of B (15) back into the first equation to find P:
    P = 15/3 = 5

8. **Substitute** the value of B (15) back into the second equation to find H:
    H = 15 + 5 = 20

Therefore, Pete is 5 years old, Bryan is 15 years old, and Philip is 20 years old.

Answer: {Pete: 5, Bryan: 15, Philip: 20}

1295,Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.,"Let 'x' represent Jack's age. Since Ana is 5 years older than Jack, Ana's age can be represented as x + 5.  The sum of their ages is 29, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 5) = 29.  Combining like terms gives us 2x + 5 = 29. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives 2x = 24.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 12.  So, Jack is 12 years old. Ana's age is x + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17. Therefore, Ana is 17 years old and Jack is 12 years old.

"
1296,Tina is 3 years younger than Tom. The ages are in the ratio 2:3. Find their ages.,"Let Tina's age be T and Tom's age be M.
We are given that Tina is 3 years younger than Tom, so T = M - 3.
We are also given that the ratio of their ages is 2:3, so T/M = 2/3.

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(M - 3)/M = 2/3
Cross-multiply:
3(M - 3) = 2M
3M - 9 = 2M
3M - 2M = 9
M = 9

Now that we know Tom's age (M) is 9, we can find Tina's age using the first equation:
T = M - 3
T = 9 - 3
T = 6

So, Tina is 6 years old and Tom is 9 years old.

Answer: {Tina is 6 years old and Tom is 9 years old.}

We are given that George is 8 years older than Christopher, so G = C + 8.
Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher, so F = C - 2.
The sum of their ages is 60, so G + C + F = 60.
Substitute the expressions for G and F in terms of C into the equation G + C + F = 60:
(C + 8) + C + (C - 2) = 60
3C + 6 = 60
3C = 54
C = 18
Now that we have Christopher's age, we can find George's and Ford's ages:
G = C + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26
F = C - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16

Answer: {George: 26, Christopher: 18, Ford: 16}

1302,Nick and Kane were born on consecutive years and on same date. Nick is younger.  The sum of their ages is 11. Find the age of the brothers.,"Let N be Nick's age and K be Kane's age.
Since Nick and Kane were born on consecutive years, Kane is older than Nick by 1 year.
Thus, K = N + 1.

The sum of their ages is 11, so N + K = 11.
Substituting K = N + 1 into N + K = 11, we get N + (N + 1) = 11.
Simplifying, we have 2N + 1 = 11.
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives 2N = 10.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives N = 5.
Then, since K = N + 1, K = 5 + 1 = 6.

So, Nick is 5 years old and Kane is 6 years old.

Answer: {Nick is 5 years old, and Kane is 6 years old.}

1303,The ages of Ashley and Mary are in the ratio 4:7. The sum of their ages is 22. Find the ages of Ashley and Mary.,"Let A be Ashley's age and M be Mary's age.
We are given that A/M = 4/7, and A + M = 22.
From the ratio, we can express Ashley's age in terms of Mary's age as A = (4/7)M.
Substitute this into the sum of their ages equation:
(4/7)M + M = 22
(4/7)M + (7/7)M = 22
(11/7)M = 22
Multiply both sides by 7/11:
M = 22 * (7/11)
M = 14
Now, substitute M = 14 back into the equation A = (4/7)M:
A = (4/7) * 14
A = 8

So, Ashley is 8 years old and Mary is 14 years old.

Answer: {Ashley: 8, Mary: 14}

1304,"The ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. Find the ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack.","Let P, M, and J be the current ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack, respectively. Since their ages are consecutive odd numbers, we can express them as:
P = x
M = x + 2
J = x + 4, where x is an odd integer.

The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
P + M = J - 5
x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) - 5
2x + 2 = x - 1
2x - x = -1 - 2
x = -3

However, age cannot be negative.  There must be some mistake in the problem statement.  It is more likely that the question meant ""The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age *in* 5 years.""

If this is the case, then the equation should be:

P + M = J + 5
x + x + 2 = x + 4 + 5
2x + 2 = x + 9
2x - x = 9 - 2
x = 7

So, the ages are:
Peter: x = 7
Margaret: x + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
Jack: x + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11

Answer: {Peter: 7, Margaret: 9, Jack: 11}

We are given that the sum of Tony's and Teddy's ages is equal to their mother's age, which is 42. So, T + O = 42. We are also given that Tony is two years younger than Teddy, which can be written as O = T - 2. We can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: T + (T - 2) = 42. Combining like terms, we get 2T - 2 = 42. Adding 2 to both sides gives 2T = 44. Dividing both sides by 2, we find T = 22. So, Teddy is 22 years old. Since Tony is two years younger than Teddy, Tony's age is O = 22 - 2 = 20.

Answer: {Tony is 20 and Teddy is 22}

We are given that Allen is 10 years younger than Scott, so
A = S - 10

Five years from now, Scott's age will be S + 5.
Allen's present age is A.
We are given that Scott's age five years from now will be twice Allen's present age, so
S + 5 = 2A

Substitute A = S - 10 into the second equation:
S + 5 = 2(S - 10)
S + 5 = 2S - 20
2S - S = 5 + 20
S = 25

Now we can find Allen's present age:
A = S - 10
A = 25 - 10
A = 15

So, Allen's present age is 15 and Scott's present age is 25.

Answer: {Allen: 15, Scott: 25}

(L+3)/(B+3) = 3/5
5(L+3) = 3(B+3)
5L + 15 = 3B + 9
5L - 3B = 9 - 15
5L - 3B = -6

Substitute B = 2L in the above equation.
5L - 3(2L) = -6
5L - 6L = -6
-L = -6
L = 6

B = 2L = 2*6 = 12

So, the present ages of Lewis and Brown are 6 and 12 respectively.

Answer: {Lewis: 6, Brown: 12}

Case 1: The given angle is one of the base angles.
Since the triangle is isosceles, the other base angle is also 54 degrees. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, the third angle (vertex angle) is 180 - 54 - 54 = 180 - 108 = 72 degrees. In this case, the base angles are 54 degrees each.

Case 2: The given angle is the vertex angle.
The vertex angle is 54 degrees. The remaining two angles are the base angles, which are equal. Let each base angle be x. Then, the sum of the angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
So, x + x + 54 = 180
2x + 54 = 180
2x = 180 - 54
2x = 126
x = 126/2
x = 63
In this case, the base angles are 63 degrees each.

The width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the triangle, which is 42 ft. The length of the rectangle is given as 76 ft.

The perimeter of the rectangular portion, excluding the width attached to the triangle, is length + width + length = 76 + 42 + 76 = 194 ft. Since the triangle is equilateral, all its sides are equal to 42 ft.  The side of the triangle attached to the rectangle is not part of the perimeter of the combined figure. Therefore, the perimeter of the triangular portion is 42 + 42 = 84 ft.

1392,"There are 650 students in a school. If the number of girls is 106 more than the boys, how many boys are there in the school?","Let 'b' be the number of boys and 'g' be the number of girls.
We know that the total number of students is 650, so b + g = 650.
We also know that the number of girls is 106 more than the boys, so g = b + 106.
Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
b + (b + 106) = 650
2b + 106 = 650
2b = 650 - 106

1393,"A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.","Let 'x' be the current age of the son and 'y' be the current age of the man.
From the first statement, we know that the man is thrice as old as his son. So, y = 3x.
After 12 years, the man's age will be y+12 and the son's age will be x+12.
The second statement tells us that after 12 years, the man will be twice as old as his son.  So, y+12 = 2(x+12).

Now we have two equations:
1. y = 3x
2. y+12 = 2(x+12)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
3x + 12 = 2(x+12)
3x + 12 = 2x + 24
3x - 2x = 24 - 12
x = 12

Now substitute x = 12 back into the first equation:
y = 3 * 12
y = 36

So, the son's present age is 12 years and the man's present age is 36 years.

Answer: {Son: 12 years old, Man: 36 years old}

1399,Mrs.Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. After 8 years she will be twice as old as Neil. Find their present ages.,"Let Mrs. Martin's present age be M and Neil's present age be N.
We are given that Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. So,
M = N + 27

After 8 years, Mrs. Martin's age will be M + 8 and Neil's age will be N + 8.
We are also given that after 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil. So,
M + 8 = 2(N + 8)
M + 8 = 2N + 16
M = 2N + 8

Now we have two equations:
1) M = N + 27
2) M = 2N + 8

Since both equations are equal to M, we can set them equal to each other:
N + 27 = 2N + 8
27 - 8 = 2N - N
19 = N

So, Neil's present age is 19 years.
Now, substitute N = 19 into equation (1):
M = 19 + 27
M = 46

So, Mrs. Martin's present age is 46 years.

Answer: {Mrs. Martin is 46 years old and Neil is 19 years old.}

1401,"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?","Let 'x' be the number of heaps of 6 marbles and 'y' be the number of heaps of 9 marbles.
We are given that the total number of marbles is 480, so we can write the equation:
6x + 9y = 480

We are also given that the total number of heaps is 72, so we can write another equation:
x + y = 72

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.  Let's use substitution.  Solve the second equation for x:
x = 72 - y

Now substitute this value of x into the first equation:
6(72 - y) + 9y = 480
432 - 6y + 9y = 480
3y = 480 - 432
3y = 48
y = 16

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x:
x = 72 - y
x = 72 - 16
x = 56

So, there are 56 heaps of 6 marbles and 16 heaps of 9 marbles.
The number of marbles in heaps of 6 is 56 * 6 = 336
The number of marbles in heaps of 9 is 16 * 9 = 144

1403,"The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. After 5 years, sum of their ages would be 70 years. Find their present ages.","Let Jacob's current age be J years and his father's current age be F years.
We are given that Jacob's father's present age is three times that of Jacob. So, we can write this as:
F = 3J

After 5 years, Jacob's age will be J+5 and his father's age will be F+5.
The sum of their ages after 5 years is 70 years. So we have:
(J+5) + (F+5) = 70
J + F + 10 = 70
J + F = 60

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
F = 3J
J + F = 60

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
J + 3J = 60
4J = 60
J = 60/4
J = 15

Now substitute the value of J back into the first equation to find F:
F = 3J
F = 3 * 15
F = 45

Therefore, Jacob's present age is 15 years and his father's present age is 45 years.

1404,"Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.","Let the width of the rectangle be 'w' meters.
The length is 8 meters less than twice the width, so the length is 2w - 8 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

We are given that the perimeter is 56 meters. So, we can set up the equation:
56 = 2( (2w - 8) + w )
56 = 2(3w - 8)
56 = 6w - 16
56 + 16 = 6w
72 = 6w
w = 72/6
w = 12

So, the width is 12 meters.
The length is 2w - 8 = 2(12) - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16 meters.

Answer: {Length = 16 m, Width = 12 m}

1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","Let Jacob's current age be J and his son's current age be S.

Five years hence, Jacob's age will be J+5 and his son's age will be S+5.
According to the problem, J+5 = 3(S+5)
J+5 = 3S+15
J = 3S + 10

Five years ago, Jacob's age was J-5 and his son's age was S-5.
According to the problem, J-5 = 7(S-5)
J-5 = 7S-35
J = 7S - 30

Now we have two equations:
1) J = 3S + 10
2) J = 7S - 30

Since both equations are equal to J, we can set them equal to each other:
3S + 10 = 7S - 30
40 = 4S
S = 10

Substitute S=10 into equation 1:
J = 3(10) + 10
J = 30 + 10
J = 40

So, Jacob's current age is 40 and his son's current age is 10.

Answer: {Jacob is 40 years old and his son is 10 years old.}

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Let 'x' be my current age and 'y' be my son's current age.

Five years ago, my age was x-5 and my son's age was y-5.  According to the problem, five years ago I was thrice as old as my son.  This translates to the equation:

x - 5 = 3(y - 5)
x - 5 = 3y - 15
x = 3y - 10

Ten years later, my age will be x+10 and my son's age will be y+10.  The problem states that in ten years, I will be twice as old as my son.  This translates to:

x + 10 = 2(y + 10)
x + 10 = 2y + 20
x = 2y + 10

Now we have two equations:
1) x = 3y - 10
2) x = 2y + 10

Since both equations equal x, we can set them equal to each other:
3y - 10 = 2y + 10
y = 20

Now substitute the value of y (20) back into either equation.  Using equation (2):
x = 2 * 20 + 10
x = 50

So, my current age is 50 and my son's current age is 20.

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let A represent A's age.
   * Let B represent B's age.
   * Let C represent C's age.
   * Let D represent D's age.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * A = B + 2  (A is two years older than B)
   * D = 2A (D is twice as old as A)
   * B = 2C (B is twice as old as C)
   * D - C = 40 (The ages of D and C differ by 40 years)

3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   * Substitute the first equation (A = B + 2) into the second equation (D = 2A):  D = 2(B + 2)  => D = 2B + 4
   * Substitute the third equation (B = 2C) into the new second equation (D = 2B + 4): D = 2(2C) + 4 => D = 4C + 4
   * Now we have two expressions for D: D = 4C + 4 and D = C + 40. Set them equal to each other: 4C + 4 = C + 40
   * Solve for C: 3C = 36 => C = 12
   * Substitute C = 12 back into B = 2C: B = 2 * 12 => B = 24
   * Substitute B = 24 back into A = B + 2: A = 24 + 2 => A = 26

Answer: {A = 26, B = 24}

Two years ago, the father's age was f-2 and the son's age was s-2.  We are told that the father was five times as old as his son.  This can be written as the equation:

f - 2 = 5(s - 2)
f - 2 = 5s - 10
f = 5s - 8

Two years later, the father's age will be f+2 and the son's age will be s+2. We are told that the father's age will be 8 more than the son's age. This can be written as the equation:

f + 2 = (s + 2) + 8
f + 2 = s + 10
f = s + 8

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) f = 5s - 8
2) f = s + 8

Since both equations equal 'f', we can set them equal to each other:

5s - 8 = s + 8
4s = 16
s = 4

Now that we know the son's current age is 4, we can plug this back into either equation to solve for the father's current age.  Let's use equation 2:

f = s + 8
f = 4 + 8
f = 12

So the father's current age is 12 and the son's current age is 4.

We are given that the father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. So, F = 3S.
After 5 years, the father's age will be F + 5, and the sum of the ages of his two children will be S + 5 + 5 = S + 10 (since there are two children).
We are given that after 5 years, the father's age will be twice the sum of the ages of his two children. So, F + 5 = 2(S + 10).
Now we have two equations:
1) F = 3S
2) F + 5 = 2(S + 10)
Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
3S + 5 = 2S + 20
3S - 2S = 20 - 5
S = 15
Now substitute S = 15 back into the first equation:

1411,5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.,"Let 'f' be the father's current age and 's' be the son's current age.

5 years hence, the father's age will be f+5 and the son's age will be s+5.  According to the problem, at that time the father's age will be three times the son's age. So we can write the equation:

f + 5 = 3(s + 5)
f + 5 = 3s + 15
f = 3s + 10

5 years earlier, the father's age was f-5 and the son's age was s-5.  At that time, the father's age was 7 times the son's age. So we can write the equation:

f - 5 = 7(s - 5)
f - 5 = 7s - 35
f = 7s - 30

Now we have two equations:

1) f = 3s + 10
2) f = 7s - 30

Since both equations equal 'f', we can set them equal to each other:

3s + 10 = 7s - 30
40 = 4s
s = 10

Now substitute the value of 's' (10) back into either equation to find 'f'. Using the first equation:

f = 3(10) + 10
f = 30 + 10
f = 40

So the father's current age is 40 and the son's current age is 10.

Answer: {Father: 40, Son: 10}

We are given that F = C.
After 15 years, the father's age will be F + 15, and the sum of the children's ages will be C + 5*15 = C + 75.
We are given that after 15 years, the sum of the children's ages will be twice the father's age, so C + 75 = 2(F + 15).
Since F = C, we can substitute C with F in the equation:
F + 75 = 2(F + 15)
F + 75 = 2F + 30
75 - 30 = 2F - F
45 = F
So the father's current age is 45 years.

Find the present ages of all.","Let the present ages of the two sons be x and x+2, and let the father's present age be F.
Ten years ago, the sons' ages were x-10 and x-8, and the father's age was F-10.
According to the problem, the sum of the sons' ages ten years ago was one-third of their father's age at that time:
(x-10) + (x-8) = (1/3)(F-10)
2x - 18 = (1/3)(F-10)
6x - 54 = F - 10
6x - 44 = F  --- (1)

The sum of the sons' present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age:
x + (x+2) = F - 14
2x + 2 = F - 14
2x + 16 = F --- (2)

Now we have two equations with two variables, F and x:
6x - 44 = F
2x + 16 = F

Set the two equations equal to each other:
6x - 44 = 2x + 16
4x = 60
x = 15

Substitute x=15 back into equation (2):
2(15) + 16 = F
30 + 16 = F
F = 46

The present ages of the sons are 15 and 15+2=17. The father's present age is 46.

Answer: {Father: 46, Son 1: 17, Son 2: 15}

1414,"If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. Find the ages of father and son.","Let 's' represent the son's age and 'f' represent the father's age.

We can translate the given information into two equations:

* **Equation 1:** 2s + f = 70
* **Equation 2:** s + 2f = 95

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2:

* 4s + 2f = 140

Now subtract the second equation from this modified first equation:

* (4s + 2f) - (s + 2f) = 140 - 95
* 3s = 45
* s = 15

So the son is 15 years old.  Now plug this value back into the first equation:

* 2(15) + f = 70
* 30 + f = 70
* f = 40

So the father is 40 years old.

Answer: {Father: 40, Son: 15}

1415,"I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?","Let 'x' represent my current age and 'y' represent my son's current age.
We are given that I am three times as old as my son, so we can write the equation:
x = 3y

Five years later, my age will be x + 5 and my son's age will be y + 5. We are also given that at that time, I will be two and a half times as old as my son.  So we can write the equation:
x + 5 = 2.5(y + 5)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
1) x = 3y
2) x + 5 = 2.5(y + 5)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
3y + 5 = 2.5(y + 5)
3y + 5 = 2.5y + 12.5
0.5y = 7.5
y = 15

Now that we know y = 15, we can substitute this back into the first equation to find x:
x = 3 * 15
x = 45

So, I am currently 45 years old and my son is 15 years old.

Answer: {I am 45 years old and my son is 15 years old.}

1416,The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.,"Let the father's present age be 'f' years and the son's present age be 's' years.
Given that the sum of their present ages is 55 years, we can write the equation:
f + s = 55  --- (1)

The difference in their ages is f - s.

When the son's age becomes equal to the father's present age (which is 'f'), the number of years that would have passed is (f - s) years.

At that time, the father's age would be f + (f - s) = 2f - s years, and the son's age would be s + (f - s) = f years.

The sum of their ages at that time would be 93 years. So, we have:
(2f - s) + f = 93
3f - s = 93  --- (2)

Now, we have two equations with two variables:
f + s = 55  --- (1)
3f - s = 93  --- (2)

Adding equations (1) and (2):
(f + s) + (3f - s) = 55 + 93
4f = 148
f = 148/4
f = 37

Substitute f = 37 in equation (1):
37 + s = 55
s = 55 - 37
s = 18

Therefore, the father's present age is 37 years, and the son's present age is 18 years.

Answer: {Father: 37 years, Son: 18 years}

1417,The ages of two friends Anna and Ben differ by 3 years. Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years. Find the ages of Anna and Ben.,"Let A be Anna's age, B be Ben's age, D be Denver's age, and C be Cathy's age.
We are given that the difference between Anna and Ben's ages is 3 years.  So, |A - B| = 3.
Denver is twice as old as Anna, so D = 2A.
Ben is twice as old as Cathy, so B = 2C.
The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years, so |D - C| = 30.

We have two possible scenarios:
Scenario 1: A > B
A - B = 3
A = B + 3
D = 2A = 2(B + 3) = 2B + 6
B = 2C, so C = B/2
D - C = 30
2B + 6 - B/2 = 30
4B + 12 - B = 60
3B = 48
B = 16
A = B + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19
D = 2A = 2(19) = 38
C = B/2 = 16/2 = 8
D - C = 38 - 8 = 30. This scenario works.

Scenario 2: B > A
B - A = 3
B = A + 3
D = 2A
B = 2C, so C = B/2 = (A+3)/2
D - C = 30
2A - (A+3)/2 = 30
4A - A - 3 = 60
3A = 63
A = 21
B = A + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24
D = 2A = 2(21) = 42
C = B/2 = 24/2 = 12
D - C = 42 - 12 = 30. This scenario also works.

The question asks for the ages of Anna and Ben. In the first scenario, Anna is 19 and Ben is 16. In the second scenario, Anna is 21 and Ben is 24.

Answer: {Anna is 19 and Ben is 16, or Anna is 21 and Ben is 24}

1418,"Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?","Let N be Nancy's current age and S be Sam's current age.
Five years ago, Nancy's age was N-5 and Sam's age was S-5.
According to the problem, five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. So,
N - 5 = 3(S - 5)
N - 5 = 3S - 15
N = 3S - 10  --- (1)

Ten years later, Nancy's age will be N+10 and Sam's age will be S+10.
According to the problem, ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. So,
N + 10 = 2(S + 10)
N + 10 = 2S + 20
N = 2S + 10 --- (2)

Now we have two equations with two variables:
N = 3S - 10 --- (1)
N = 2S + 10 --- (2)
Since both expressions are equal to N, we can equate them:
3S - 10 = 2S + 10
3S - 2S = 10 + 10
S = 20

Now, substitute the value of S into equation (1) to find N:
N = 3(20) - 10
N = 60 - 10
N = 50

Therefore, Nancy is currently 50 years old and Sam is currently 20 years old.

Answer: {Nancy is 50 years old, and Sam is 20 years old.}

1419,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.,"Let the two-digit number be 10a + b, where a and b are the digits.
According to the problem, seven times the number is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the digits. So, we can write the equation:
7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)
70a + 7b = 40b + 4a
66a = 33b
2a = b

The sum of the digits is 3. So,
a + b = 3
Since b = 2a, we can substitute this into the equation:
a + 2a = 3
3a = 3
a = 1

Now, substitute the value of a back into the equation b = 2a:
b = 2(1)
b = 2

So, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 2 = 12.

Answer: {12}

1420,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.,"Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively.
We are given two conditions:
1. The number is four times the sum of its digits.
   10a + b = 4(a + b)
   10a + b = 4a + 4b
   6a = 3b
   2a = b

2. The number is twice the product of its digits.
   10a + b = 2(a * b)
   10a + b = 2ab

Substitute b = 2a from the first equation into the second equation:
10a + 2a = 2a(2a)
12a = 4a^2
Divide both sides by 4a (since a cannot be 0):
3 = a

Now substitute a = 3 back into b = 2a:
b = 2 * 3
b = 6

So the number is 10a + b = 10(3) + 6 = 30 + 6 = 36.

1421,"A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.","Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the digits.
The number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits, so we can write the equation:
10a + b = 7(a + b)
10a + b = 7a + 7b
3a = 6b
a = 2b

When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. This can be written as:
10a + b - 27 = 10b + a
9a - 9b = 27
a - b = 3

Now we have two equations:
1) a = 2b
2) a - b = 3

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
2b - b = 3
b = 3

Now substitute the value of b back into the first equation:

1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.","Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively.
We are given that the sum of the digits is 9, so a + b = 9.
When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10b + a.
The problem states that reversing the digits increases the number by 9, so (10b + a) - (10a + b) = 9.
Simplifying the equation, we get 9b - 9a = 9, which further simplifies to b - a = 1.
Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:
1) a + b = 9
2) b - a = 1
We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
(a + b) + (b - a) = 9 + 1
2b = 10
b = 5
Now substitute b = 5 into the first equation:
a + 5 = 9
a = 4
So the original number is 10a + b = 10(4) + 5 = 45.
The reversed number is 10b + a = 10(5) + 4 = 54.
54 - 45 = 9, which confirms our solution.

When the number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed. This can be written as:
10a + b - 27 = 10b + a

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
1) a + b = 15
2) 10a + b - 27 = 10b + a

From equation (1), we can express b in terms of a:
b = 15 - a

Substitute this expression for b into equation (2):
10a + (15 - a) - 27 = 10(15 - a) + a
10a + 15 - a - 27 = 150 - 10a + a
9a - 12 = 150 - 9a
18a = 162
a = 9

Now substitute the value of a back into the expression for b:
b = 15 - 9
b = 6

So the original number is 10a + b = 10(9) + 6 = 96.

We are given that the tens digit is three times the unit digit, so x = 3y.
When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed.  This can be represented as:
10x + y - 54 = 10y + x
Substitute x = 3y into the equation:
10(3y) + y - 54 = 10y + 3y
30y + y - 54 = 13y
31y - 54 = 13y
31y - 13y = 54
18y = 54
y = 54/18
y = 3
Now, substitute y = 3 back into x = 3y:

Given that the sum of the digits is 8, we have:
a + b = 8

The number formed by reversing the digits is 10b + a. The difference between the original number and the reversed number is 18:
|(10a + b) - (10b + a)| = 18
|9a - 9b| = 18
|a - b| = 2

We have two cases:
Case 1: a - b = 2
Adding the two equations a + b = 8 and a - b = 2, we get:
2a = 10
a = 5
Substituting a = 5 in a + b = 8, we get:
5 + b = 8
b = 3

1426,"A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.","Let the speed of the boat in still water be 'b' km/hr and the speed of the stream be 's' km/hr.

The speed upstream is (b - s) km/hr, and the speed downstream is (b + s) km/hr.

Time = Distance / Speed

According to the first condition, the boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. So,
30 / (b - s) + 44 / (b + s) = 10   ---(1)

According to the second condition, the boat goes 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream in 13 hours. So,
40 / (b - s) + 55 / (b + s) = 13   ---(2)

Let 1/(b-s) = x and 1/(b+s) = y

The equations become:
30x + 44y = 10
40x + 55y = 13

Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3:
120x + 176y = 40
120x + 165y = 39

Subtract the second equation from the first:
11y = 1
y = 1/11

Substitute y = 1/11 in 30x + 44y = 10
30x + 44(1/11) = 10
30x + 4 = 10
30x = 6
x = 6/30 = 1/5

Now we have:
1/(b - s) = 1/5  => b - s = 5
1/(b + s) = 1/11 => b + s = 11

Adding the two equations:
2b = 16
b = 8

Substituting b = 8 in b + s = 11:
8 + s = 11
s = 3

Therefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 8 km/hr, and the speed of the stream is 3 km/hr.

When rowing downstream, the speed is the sum of rowing speed and current speed (r + c).
Distance = Speed × Time
20 km = (r + c) × 2 hours
r + c = 20/2
r + c = 10  --- Equation (1)

When rowing upstream, the speed is the difference between rowing speed and current speed (r - c).
Distance = Speed × Time
4 km = (r - c) × 2 hours
r - c = 4/2
r - c = 2  --- Equation (2)

The speed downstream is (s + c) km/hr, and the speed upstream is (s - c) km/hr.

We are given that the sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes, which is 40/60 = 2/3 hours.
So, the speed downstream is distance/time = 8 / (2/3) = 8 * 3/2 = 12 km/hr.
Thus, s + c = 12

The sailor comes back 8 km upstream in 1 hour.
So, the speed upstream is distance/time = 8 / 1 = 8 km/hr.
Thus, s - c = 8

Now we have two equations:

What are their respective speeds?","Let the speed of the car starting from A be 'a' km/hr and the speed of the car starting from B be 'b' km/hr.

When they travel in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference of their speeds.  Since they meet in 7 hours and the distance between them is 70 km, we have:
7(a - b) = 70  =>  a - b = 10

When they travel towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. Since they meet in 1 hour, we have:
1(a + b) = 70  =>  a + b = 70

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

Case 1:
Distance covered by train = 400 km
Distance covered by car = 600 - 400 = 200 km
Time taken = 6 hours 30 minutes = 6.5 hours

Time taken by train = Distance/Speed = 400/x
Time taken by car = Distance/Speed = 200/y

Substitute the value of y in equation (1):
400/x + 200/80 = 6.5
400/x + 2.5 = 6.5
400/x = 4
x = 400/4
x = 100 km/h

Therefore, the speed of the train is 100 km/h and the speed of the car is 80 km/h.

Answer: {Train: 100 km/h, Car: 80 km/h}

1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","Let C be the total charge, F be the fixed charge, d be the distance covered, and r be the rate per km.
We can set up a system of equations:
C = F + rd
For a 10 km journey, the charge is $75:
75 = F + 10r
For a 15 km journey, the charge is $110:
110 = F + 15r

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate F:
110 - 75 = (F + 15r) - (F + 10r)
35 = 5r
r = 35/5
r = 7

Now, substitute r = 7 back into the first equation to find F:
75 = F + 10(7)
75 = F + 70
F = 75 - 70
F = 5

So the equation for the charge is C = 5 + 7d.
For a 25 km journey:
C = 5 + 7(25)
C = 5 + 175
C = 180

1433,A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Let F be the full fare and R be the reservation charge.
We are given that a reserved first class ticket costs $216. So, F + R = 216.
We are also given that one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. The cost of a half ticket is F/2 + R. So, F + R + F/2 + R = 327.
This simplifies to (3/2)F + 2R = 327.
We have a system of two equations:
1) F + R = 216
2) (3/2)F + 2R = 327
Multiply equation (1) by 2: 2F + 2R = 432.
Subtract this new equation from equation (2):
(3/2)F + 2R - (2F + 2R) = 327 - 432
(3/2)F - 2F = -105
(-1/2)F = -105
F = 210
Substitute F = 210 into equation (1): 210 + R = 216
R = 6
So, the basic first class full fare is $210 and the reservation charge is $6.

Answer: {210, 6}

1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let 'd' be the distance covered by the man and 's' be his original speed in km/hr.
The time taken to cover the distance 'd' at speed 's' is given by t = d/s.

Case 1: If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less.
Speed = s + 1/2
Time = t - 1
Distance = d
So, d = (s + 1/2)(t - 1)

Case 2: If he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours.
Speed = s - 1
Time = t + 3
Distance = d
So, d = (s - 1)(t + 3)

We have two equations:
1. d = st
2. d = (s + 1/2)(t - 1)
3. d = (s - 1)(t + 3)

From equation 1, t = d/s. Substituting this into equations 2 and 3, we get:

2. d = (s + 1/2)(d/s - 1)  => d = d + d/(2s) - s - 1/2 => d/(2s) - s = 1/2 => d - 2s^2 = s
3. d = (s - 1)(d/s + 3) => d = d - d/s + 3s - 3 => d/s - 3s = -3 => d - 3s^2 = -3s

Now we have two equations with two variables:
1. d - 2s^2 = s
2. d - 3s^2 = -3s

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:
(d - 2s^2) - (d - 3s^2) = s - (-3s)
s^2 = 4s
s^2 - 4s = 0
s(s - 4) = 0

Since speed cannot be 0, s = 4 km/hr.
Now substitute s = 4 in equation 1:
d - 2(4^2) = 4
d - 32 = 4
d = 36 km

Answer: {Distance = 36 km, Speed = 4 km/hr}

1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"Let 'x' be the time spent going uphill and 'y' be the time spent going downhill. We are given that the total time spent is 15 hours, so we have:
x + y = 15

We are also given that the total distance covered is 650 km. The distance covered uphill is the speed uphill multiplied by the time uphill, which is 30x. The distance covered downhill is the speed downhill multiplied by the time downhill, which is 50y. So, we have:
30x + 50y = 650

We have a system of two equations with two variables:
1) x + y = 15
2) 30x + 50y = 650

We can solve for x in the first equation:
x = 15 - y

Now, substitute this value of x into the second equation:
30(15 - y) + 50y = 650
450 - 30y + 50y = 650
20y = 200
y = 10

Now, substitute the value of y back into the equation x = 15 - y:
x = 15 - 10
x = 5

So, the car traveled uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

1436,"Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","Let the speed of the train be 'x' km/hr and the speed of the bus be 'y' km/hr.

In the first case, she travels 60 km by train and 240 km (300-60) by bus.  The time taken is 4 hours. So, we can write the equation:

60/x + 240/y = 4

In the second case, she travels 100 km by train and 200 km (300-100) by bus. The time taken is 4 hours and 10 minutes, which is 4 + 10/60 = 4 + 1/6 = 25/6 hours.  So, we can write the equation:

100/x + 200/y = 25/6

Now we have two equations:

1. 60/x + 240/y = 4
2. 100/x + 200/y = 25/6

To solve these, we can simplify the equations:

1.  Dividing by 60:  1/x + 4/y = 1/15
2.  Dividing by 100: 1/x + 2/y = 1/24

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(1/x + 4/y) - (1/x + 2/y) = 1/15 - 1/24
2/y = (8-5)/120
2/y = 3/120
2/y = 1/40
y = 80

Now substitute y = 80 into equation (2):
1/x + 2/80 = 1/24
1/x + 1/40 = 1/24
1/x = 1/24 - 1/40
1/x = (5-3)/120
1/x = 2/120
1/x = 1/60
x = 60

So, the speed of the train is 60 km/hr and the speed of the bus is 80 km/hr.

Answer: {Train: 60 km/hr, Bus: 80 km/hr}

1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","Let the original speed be 's' km/hr and the scheduled time be 't' hours.
The distance of the journey is given by distance = speed × time = s × t.

Case 1: Train is 6 km/hr faster.
Speed = (s + 6) km/hr
Time = (t - 8) hours
Distance = (s + 6)(t - 8) = st

Case 2: Train is 6 km/hr slower.
Speed = (s - 6) km/hr
Time = (t + 12) hours
Distance = (s - 6)(t + 12) = st

We now have two equations:
(s + 6)(t - 8) = st
st - 8s + 6t - 48 = st
-8s + 6t = 48  --- (1)

(s - 6)(t + 12) = st
st + 12s - 6t - 72 = st
12s - 6t = 72 --- (2)

Multiply equation (1) by 2:
-16s + 12t = 96 --- (3)

Add equations (2) and (3):
12s - 6t - 16s + 12t = 72 + 96
-4s + 6t = 168
-4s + 2(3t) = 168
From (1), 3t = 4s + 24
-4s + 2(4s+24) = 168
-4s + 8s + 48 = 168
4s = 120
s = 30

Substitute s=30 in (1):
-8(30) + 6t = 48
-240 + 6t = 48
6t = 288
t = 48

Distance = st = 30 * 48 = 1440 km

1439,"The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.","Let the cost of a bat be 'b' and the cost of a ball be 'a'.
The first purchase can be represented by the equation: 7b + 6a = 3800
The second purchase can be represented by the equation: 3b + 5a = 1750

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 'b' and 'a'.  One way to do this is using elimination.  Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 7:

21b + 18a = 11400
21b + 35a = 12250

Subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:
(21b + 35a) - (21b + 18a) = 12250 - 11400
17a = 850
a = 50

Now substitute the value of 'a' back into one of the original equations, such as the second equation:
3b + 5(50) = 1750
3b + 250 = 1750
3b = 1500
b = 500

Therefore, the cost of each bat is $500 and the cost of each ball is $50.

Answer: {Bat: $500, Ball: $50}

1441,"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.","Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively.
The sum of the digits is a + b = 9.
Reversing the digits gives the number 10b + a.
Nine times the original number is 9(10a + b).
Twice the reversed number is 2(10b + a).
We are given that 9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a).
Expanding the equation gives 90a + 9b = 20b + 2a.
Simplifying gives 88a = 11b, or 8a = b.
Since a + b = 9, we can substitute b = 8a to get a + 8a = 9, which implies 9a = 9, so a = 1.
Since b = 8a, we have b = 8(1) = 8.
Therefore, the number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 8 = 18.

But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?","Let x be the amount invested at 12% and y be the amount invested at 10%.
The interest earned is given by the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time.
Since the time is 1 year, we can simplify the formula to Interest = Principal * Rate.

From the given information, we have two equations:
1. 0.12x + 0.10y = 130
2. 0.10x + 0.12y = 134

Multiply the first equation by 10:
1.2x + y = 1300
y = 1300 - 1.2x

Substitute this value of y into the second equation:
0.10x + 0.12(1300 - 1.2x) = 134
0.10x + 156 - 0.144x = 134
-0.044x = -22
x = 500

Substitute x = 500 into the equation y = 1300 - 1.2x:
y = 1300 - 1.2(500)
y = 1300 - 600
y = 700

So, he invested $500 at 12% and $700 at 10%.

3x - 2x = 24 - 12
x = 12

1446,The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.,"Let the two supplementary angles be x and y.
Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. So, x + y = 180.
The larger angle (let's say x) exceeds the smaller angle (y) by 18 degrees. So, x = y + 18.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first:
(y + 18) + y = 180
2y + 18 = 180
2y = 180 - 18
2y = 162
y = 162 / 2

The original area of the rectangle is A = l * b square units.

According to the first condition, if the length is reduced by 5 units and the breadth is increased by 3 units, the area is reduced by 9 square units.
So, (l - 5)(b + 3) = lb - 9
Expanding the equation: lb + 3l - 5b - 15 = lb - 9
3l - 5b = 6  --- Equation (1)

According to the second condition, if the length is increased by 3 units and the breadth is increased by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units.
So, (l + 3)(b + 2) = lb + 67
Expanding the equation: lb + 2l + 3b + 6 = lb + 67
2l + 3b = 61 --- Equation (2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

Given that the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, we can write this as: t = 4u.
Since it is a 2-digit number, the original number can be represented as 10t + u.
When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10u + t.
The problem states that the new number is 54 less than the original number, so we can write this as: 10u + t = 10t + u - 54
Simplifying the equation, we get: 9u - 9t = -54, which further simplifies to u - t = -6.
We already know that t = 4u. Substituting this into the equation u - t = -6, we get u - 4u = -6.
This simplifies to -3u = -6, which means u = 2.
Now we can find the tens digit: t = 4u = 4 * 2 = 8.
Therefore, the original number is 10t + u = 10 * 8 + 2 = 82.

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"Let the measure of the first angle be x degrees.
Since two angles are the same size, the second angle is also x degrees.
The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so its measure is x - 12 degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
So we have the equation:
x + x + (x - 12) = 180
3x - 12 = 180
3x = 180 + 12
3x = 192
x = 192 / 3
x = 64

The first angle is 64 degrees.
The second angle is 64 degrees.
The third angle is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

1471,The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?,"Explanation:
Let the first angle be x.
The second angle is 5x.
The third angle is x + 12.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
So, x + 5x + x + 12 = 180
7x + 12 = 180
7x = 180 - 12
7x = 168
x = 168 / 7
x = 24

The first angle is 24 degrees.
The second angle is 5 * 24 = 120 degrees.
The third angle is 24 + 12 = 36 degrees.

1472,"The second angle of a triangle is three times the first, and the third is 12 degrees less than twice the first. Find the measures of the angles.","Let's denote the first angle as 'x'.
The second angle is three times the first, so it's 3x.
The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first, so it's 2x - 12.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + 2x - 12 = 180

Combine like terms:

6x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

6x = 192

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 32

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the measures of the other two angles:

Second angle: 3x = 3 * 32 = 96 degrees
Third angle: 2x - 12 = 2 * 32 - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52 degrees

So, the measures of the angles are 32 degrees, 96 degrees, and 52 degrees.

Answer: {32, 96, 52}

1473,The perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width. Find the dimensions.,"Let's represent the width of the rectangle as 'w' and the length as 'l'.
We are given that the length is 15 cm greater than the width, which can be written as l = w + 15.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w). We are given that the perimeter is 150 cm.
Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:
150 = 2(w + 15 + w)
150 = 2(2w + 15)
150 = 4w + 30
150 - 30 = 4w
120 = 4w
w = 120/4
w = 30
Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the equation l = w + 15:
l = 30 + 15
l = 45
So, the width of the rectangle is 30 cm and the length is 45 cm.

We are given that the perimeter is 96 meters, so 2L + 2W = 96.
We are also given that the length is 14 meters more than the width, so L = W + 14.
Substitute the expression for L into the perimeter equation:
2(W + 14) + 2W = 96
2W + 28 + 2W = 96
4W + 28 = 96
4W = 96 - 28
4W = 68
W = 68/4
W = 17
Now, find the length using L = W + 14:
L = 17 + 14
L = 31
So the dimensions of the court are 31 meters by 17 meters.

Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe, so J = (1/2)M.

Substitute J = (1/2)M into the equation J + M = 7500:
(1/2)M + M = 7500
(3/2)M = 7500
M = (2/3) * 7500
M = 5000

Now, substitute M = 5000 into J = (1/2)M:
J = (1/2) * 5000

All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?","Explanation:
Let 'x' be the number of containers of yellow paint sold.
The total amount of yellow paint sold is 2x liters.
Let 'y' be the number of containers of blue paint sold.
The total amount of blue paint sold is 19y liters.

Since the store sold equal quantities of yellow and blue paint, we have:

If Martha wishes to purchase the same number of pencils as pens, what is the smallest number of pens that she can buy?","Let 'p' be the number of pencils in a pack and 'n' be the number of pens in a pack. Martha is buying 18 packs of pencils, so she will have 18p pencils. She is also buying 14 packs of pens, so she will have 14n pens. We are given that she wants to buy the same number of pencils as pens, so we need to find the smallest values of p and n such that 18p = 14n.  We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us 9p = 7n.
Since 7 and 9 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the smallest values for p and n that satisfy this equation are p=7 and n=9.

2066,"Bill observed two types of birds in the bushes: sparrows and parrots. While the sparrows were in flocks of 13, the parrots were in flocks of 14. If Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, what is the smallest number of sparrows that he could have observed?","Let $s$ be the number of sparrows Bill observed and $p$ be the number of parrots he observed.
We are given that sparrows are in flocks of 13, so $s$ must be a multiple of 13, i.e., $s = 13n$ for some integer $n$.
Similarly, parrots are in flocks of 14, so $p$ must be a multiple of 14, i.e., $p = 14m$ for some integer $m$.
We are given that Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, so $s = p$. Therefore, we have $13n = 14m$.
We are looking for the smallest number of sparrows, so we want the smallest positive integer value for $s = 13n$.
Since 13 and 14 are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the smallest values of $n$ and $m$ that satisfy $13n = 14m$ are $n=14$ and $m=13$.
So, the smallest number of sparrows observed is $s = 13n = 13(14) = 182$.
The smallest number of parrots observed is $p = 14m = 14(13) = 182$.
Thus, the smallest number of sparrows Bill could have observed is 182.

2070,Melanie has pieces of train track that are 8 inches long that she is connecting together to form a track that her train can travel on. Martin is also trying to construct a track for his train but is using track pieces that are 20 inches long. How long will the shortest track be if the track that Melanie builds ends up being the same length as Martin's track?,"Let M be the length of Melanie's track pieces (8 inches) and N be the number of Melanie's track pieces.
Let R be the length of Martin's track pieces (20 inches) and S be the number of Martin's track pieces.

The total length of Melanie's track is M * N = 8N.
The total length of Martin's track is R * S = 20S.

We are looking for the shortest track length where Melanie's track length equals Martin's track length.
8N = 20S
We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 4:
2N = 5S

We are looking for the smallest integers N and S that satisfy this equation. Since 2 and 5 are relatively prime, the smallest solution will occur when N is a multiple of 5 and S is a multiple of 2. The smallest such multiples are N = 5 and S = 2.

Prime factorize 75: 3 * 5 * 5
Prime factorize 30: 2 * 3 * 5

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization and multiplying them together: 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 150.

So every 150th customer receives both a free drink and free popcorn.

Since 3,000 customers came to the theatre, we divide 3000 by 150: 3000 / 150 = 20.

Therefore, 20 people received both free items.

This means we could divide the food among 1 student and each student would get 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza.  However, since it likely each student gets some cookies and pizza, and given there are 20 cookies. The greatest amount of students would be 20, and each student gets 1 cookie and 2 pizza slices since 40/20=2.

If each student gets 1 cookie, there must be 20 students present. If each student gets 2 slices of pizza, since there are 40 slices in total, there must also be 40/2 = 20 students present.  This scenario works, and it is the largest number of students possible, since there are only 20 cookies. Therefore each student receives 1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza.


Answer: {1 cookie and 2 pizza slices}

2091,"Jessica wants of make a garland out of 8 roses, 12 daisies and 48 marigolds. How many arrangements can she make with those flowers so that, there is no flower left.","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD):**  We need to find the largest number of identical groups Jessica can make using all her flowers. This means finding the greatest common divisor of 8, 12, and 48.  The GCD is 4.

2. **Flowers per group:** Divide the number of each flower by the GCD to find out how many of each flower are in each group:
    * Roses: 8 / 4 = 2 roses per group
    * Daisies: 12 / 4 = 3 daisies per group
    * Marigolds: 48 / 4 = 12 marigolds per group

3. **Arrangements within a group:**  Within each group, Jessica can arrange the flowers in (2 + 3 + 12)! = 17! ways. This is because there are a total of 17 flowers in each group, and we are considering all possible arrangements.

4. **Total arrangements:** Since there are 4 identical groups, the overall number of arrangements is 17!
