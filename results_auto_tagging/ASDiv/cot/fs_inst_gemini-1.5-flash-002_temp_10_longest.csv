The problem states that the donation to The Forest Reserve is $140.00 more than the donation to Animal Preservation Park.  Therefore, the donation to The Forest Reserve is x + $140.00.

The total donation to all three parks is $570.00 (Treetown National Park) + x (Animal Preservation Park) + (x + $140.00) (The Forest Reserve).

This can be simplified to: 2x + $710.00.

We don't have enough information to solve for 'x' and determine the exact amounts donated to each park individually.  However, the question only asks for the *total* donated to all three parks.  The total donation amount is dependent on the amount donated to Animal Preservation Park. Therefore, without additional information, the total amount cannot be calculated. The problem needs additional information to determine the amount donated to Animal Preservation Park, or it should ask for the answer in terms of x.

674,"Many families serve each person in the family one 6-ounce glass of orange juice each morning. If they buy orange juice by the gallon, how many whole servings of juice will they get out of one gallon (one gallon = 4 quarts, 1 quart = 32 ounces) of juice?","First, we need to determine the total number of ounces in one gallon of orange juice.  Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon and 32 ounces in a quart, there are 4 quarts/gallon * 32 ounces/quart = 128 ounces in one gallon.

Next, we need to figure out how many 6-ounce servings are in 128 ounces.  To do this, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per serving: 128 ounces / 6 ounces/serving = 21.33 servings.

Since we can only have whole servings, we round down to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, they will get 21 whole servings of orange juice from one gallon.

676,A company donates 935 pencils to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among 9 classrooms. The rest of the pencils are given to the library. How many pencils were donated to the library?,"First, find out how many pencils each classroom received.  Divide the total number of pencils by the number of classrooms: 935 pencils / 9 classrooms = 103 pencils per classroom with a remainder.

Next, find the remainder. This remainder represents the number of pencils that were not able to be evenly distributed among the classrooms and were thus given to the library.  To find the remainder, use the following calculation: 935 - (103 pencils/classroom * 9 classrooms) = 935 - 927 = 8 pencils.

Therefore, 8 pencils were donated to the library.

714,Debby makes 67 pancakes. She adds blueberries to 20 of them and bananas to 24 of them. The rest are plain. How many plain pancakes are there?,"Answer: To find the number of plain pancakes, we first find the total number of pancakes with blueberries and bananas.  Debby added blueberries to 20 pancakes and bananas to 24 pancakes.  However, some pancakes may have both blueberries and bananas, so we don't simply add these numbers.  We need to find how many pancakes have either blueberries or bananas. This is given by the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle which states:  |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. However, we only know that some pancakes have blueberries and bananas. Let's say that x pancakes have both blueberries and bananas. Then the number of pancakes with either blueberries or bananas or both is 20 + 24 - x.
The number of plain pancakes is the total number of pancakes minus the number of pancakes with either blueberries or bananas. The question states that the rest are plain, and therefore we have 67 - (20 + 24 - x) plain pancakes. The question doesn't explicitly state whether any pancakes have both, therefore we can assume that there are no pancakes that have both blueberries and bananas.  Therefore the number of pancakes with either blueberries or bananas is 20 + 24 = 44. This is the minimum number of pancakes that have toppings.  The maximum would be 44 if no pancakes have both.
The number of plain pancakes is 67 - 44 = 23.
However, we cannot be sure of the actual number of plain pancakes unless we are provided more information. The question does not give us enough information to exactly determine the number of plain pancakes. There could be as many as 23 plain pancakes.

793,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?","To minimize the number of barrels used, we should use as many large barrels as possible.  Each large barrel holds 6 tons.

First, let's find out how many tons of oil are left over after using as many large barrels as possible:

95 tons (total oil) divided by 6 tons/barrel = 15.83 barrels.  Since we can't use fractions of barrels, we can use 15 large barrels.

This means 15 large barrels will hold 15 * 6 = 90 tons of oil.

We have 95 - 90 = 5 tons of oil remaining.  This will perfectly fill one small barrel.

Therefore, to use the least number of barrels, the transport company should use 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel.

Let's see how many 4-yard pieces we can get from the 27-yard rope: 27 / 4 = 6 with a remainder of 3 yards.  This means we can cut 6 long pieces (6 * 4 = 24 yards), leaving 3 yards.  The remaining 3 yards can then be cut into 3 short pieces (1 yard each). This gives a total of 6 + 3 = 9 pieces.

Any other combination will result in more pieces. For example, if we cut 5 long pieces (20 yards), we'd have 7 yards left, requiring 7 short pieces, for a total of 12 pieces.

801,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?","To minimize the number of trucks used, we should prioritize using the larger trucks as much as possible.

First, let's see how many tons can be carried by large trucks only:  134 tons / 15 tons/truck = 8.93 trucks.  Since we can't use parts of trucks, we can use a maximum of 8 large trucks.

This would transport 8 large trucks * 15 tons/truck = 120 tons.

The remaining amount is 134 tons - 120 tons = 14 tons.

Now, we can use small trucks to carry this remaining 14 tons.  14 tons / 7 tons/truck = 2 small trucks.

In total, this would be 8 large trucks + 2 small trucks = 10 trucks.  This is the minimum number of trucks required to transport all 134 tons of fruits.

In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many small trucks should be used?","To minimize the number of trucks used, we should prioritize using the large trucks as much as possible.  Each large truck carries 15 tons.

First, let's see how many large trucks are needed: 134 tons / 15 tons/truck ≈ 8.93 trucks.  Since we can't use parts of trucks, we need to round up to 9 large trucks.

Nine large trucks will carry 9 trucks * 15 tons/truck = 135 tons.  This is more than the 134 tons Mr. Lee needs to transport.

However, if we use 8 large trucks, they will carry 8 trucks * 15 tons/truck = 120 tons.  This leaves 134 tons - 120 tons = 14 tons to be transported.

To transport the remaining 14 tons, we need to use small trucks which can carry 7 tons each.  14 tons / 7 tons/truck = 2 small trucks.

Therefore, to minimize the number of trucks while ensuring all trucks are fully loaded, Mr. Lee should use 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks.

Total number of apples = 495
Number of apples per basket = 25

Number of baskets = Total number of apples / Number of apples per basket 
Number of baskets = 495 / 25 = 19.8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a basket, we round down to the nearest whole number.  However, this problem implies each basket must contain exactly 25 apples. Therefore, we should not round down; instead, we recognize that 19 baskets will contain 19 * 25 = 475 apples.  There will be 20 apples left over that cannot be evenly distributed among the baskets, meaning the answer must be 19.

Answer: {19}

809,"A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?","To minimize the number of groups, we should maximize the number of larger groups (7 members each).

Let's denote:

* 'x' as the number of large groups (7 members each)
* 'y' as the number of small groups (3 members each)

We have the equation: 7x + 3y = 90  (total members)

We want to find the largest integer value of 'x' that satisfies this equation, where 'x' and 'y' are non-negative integers.

Let's solve for y:

y = (90 - 7x) / 3

We need to find the largest integer x such that (90 - 7x) is divisible by 3.  We can test values of x:

* If x = 0, y = 30
* If x = 1, y = 29

814,"A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?","Explanation:
First, find out how many rabbits can fit in the 17 cages if each cage has the same number of rabbits.  Divide the total number of rabbits by the number of cages: 164 rabbits / 17 cages = 9 rabbits per cage with a remainder of 11 rabbits.

Next, determine how many more rabbits are needed to fill all 17 cages completely. Since there are 17 cages and only 9 rabbits can fit in each cage with the current number of rabbits, we need 17 cages * 9 rabbits/cage = 153 rabbits.  Then subtract the number of rabbits the farmer already owns from the total rabbits needed: 153 rabbits - 164 rabbits = -11.  This is a negative number, meaning the farmer has more rabbits than needed to fill the cages with an equal amount. If the farmer wants to have an equal amount of rabbits per cage, then the farmer should remove 11 rabbits.

However, if the question was intended to ask how many rabbits should be added to the farmer's current amount to have an equal number of rabbits in all 17 cages, we would calculate it like this:
The farmer has 164 rabbits. The farmer needs to find the smallest multiple of 17 that is greater than 164. Multiples of 17 are: 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170...
The smallest multiple of 17 greater than 164 is 170. The farmer needs to buy 170 - 164 = 6 more rabbits.

If she wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts, how many more tarts should she make?","To find out how many more tarts Mrs. Dalloway needs to make, we first need to determine how many tarts she can put in each box.  Since she wants to fill 10 boxes equally, she'll put 85 tarts / 10 boxes = 8.5 tarts per box.  However, she can't put half a tart in a box.  This means she can only put 8 tarts in each box, leaving 5 tarts leftover (85 - 80 = 5). To fill all 10 boxes with 8 tarts each, she needs a total of 10 boxes * 8 tarts/box = 80 tarts.  Therefore, she needs to make 80 - 85 = -5 more tarts (meaning she has 5 extra tarts).  However, the question asks how many *more* tarts she needs, implying a positive number.  The question is poorly phrased because it asks for the additional tarts needed to fill 10 boxes equally even though she already has enough to fill 8 boxes. To fill all ten boxes equally, she'd need 80 tarts, so she needs to make 80 - 85 = -5 more tarts.  Since she already has enough, she doesn't need to make any *more*, but to fill the boxes equally, she needs to bake more.  She should make 5 fewer tarts, or 0 more.  In the context of the question, the best answer is 0. If the question was asking how many tarts would she need in total to fill 10 boxes equally, then the answer would be 80.

817,"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?","To determine how many more books need to be purchased, we first need to find out how many books can fit on the 83 shelves if they are shelved equally.  We divide the total number of shelves by the number of books: 4305 / 83 = 51.87 (approximately).  Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we round this down to 51 books per shelf.  This means that 51 books/shelf * 83 shelves = 4233 books can be shelved.

Next, we find the difference between the number of books currently available and the number of books needed to fill all the shelves equally: 4305 - 4233 = 72.  Since we have 72 extra books, this means that we already have enough books to fill 4233 spaces.  To fill all 83 shelves equally, with 52 books on each shelf, we'd need 52 books/shelf * 83 shelves = 4316 books.  Therefore, we need 4316 - 4305 = 11 more books.

818,"A company buys 88 bureaus for 14 offices. If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, how many more bureaus are needed at least?","Explanation:
First, we need to determine how many bureaus each office receives if the bureaus are divided equally.  We divide the total number of bureaus (88) by the number of offices (14): 88 / 14 = 6 with a remainder of 4.  This means each office gets 6 bureaus, and there are 4 bureaus left over.

To determine how many more bureaus are needed, we need to find the number of bureaus needed to give each office the same number of bureaus. The division of 88 bureaus by 14 offices resulted in a remainder of 4 bureaus. To have an equal number of bureaus in each office, we need to add enough bureaus to give each of the 14 offices an additional bureau.  Therefore, we need at least 14 - 4 = 10 more bureaus.

819,"Betty has 367 beads and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?","Explanation:
First, find the total number of beads needed for 15 necklaces.  Since each necklace will have the same number of beads, divide the total number of beads Betty has by the number of necklaces she wants to make: 367 beads / 15 necklaces = 24.466... beads per necklace.  Since Betty can't use a fraction of a bead, she needs to round up to 25 beads per necklace.  Then, multiply the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces to find the total number of beads needed: 25 beads/necklace * 15 necklaces = 375 beads. Finally, subtract the number of beads Betty already has from the total number of beads needed to determine how many more she needs: 375 beads - 367 beads = 8 beads.

820,"There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?","To find out how many more pudding cups are needed, we first need to determine how many pudding cups each student would receive if the cups were distributed equally.  We divide the total number of pudding cups by the number of students: 315 cups / 218 students ≈ 1.44 cups per student.

Since students can't receive fractions of pudding cups, each student would receive 1 cup.  This means that 1 * 218 = 218 pudding cups would be used.

To find the number of additional pudding cups needed, we subtract the number of cups used from the total number of pudding cups: 315 cups - 218 cups = 97 cups.

Therefore, at least 97 more pudding cups are needed to ensure each student gets an equal number of cups.

Answer: {97}

821,"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?","To find out how many more riddles Sam needs, we first determine how many riddles each student would get if the riddles were divided equally.  We divide the number of riddles by the number of students: 389 riddles / 18 students ≈ 21.61 riddles per student.

Since Sam can't give a fraction of a riddle, he needs to round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 22 riddles per student.

Next, we calculate the total number of riddles needed if each student gets 22 riddles: 22 riddles/student * 18 students = 396 riddles.

Finally, we subtract the number of riddles Sam already has from the total number of riddles needed: 396 riddles - 389 riddles = 7 riddles.

Therefore, Sam needs 7 more riddles.

822,"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?","To find out how many more chairs need to be purchased, we first need to determine how many chairs each classroom would receive if the chairs were distributed equally.  We can do this by dividing the total number of chairs by the number of classrooms: 1093 chairs / 35 classrooms = 31.2 chairs per classroom.

Since we can't have a fraction of a chair, each classroom would receive 31 chairs.  To find the total number of chairs needed to provide 31 chairs to each of the 35 classrooms, we multiply 31 chairs/classroom * 35 classrooms = 1085 chairs.

Finally, to determine how many more chairs need to be purchased, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed: 1093 chairs - 1085 chairs = 8 more chairs.

How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?","Let's work backwards from the end of Jose's bus ride to determine how many people were on the bus when he boarded.

* **Terminal Station:** 15 people got off, leaving the bus empty.  Therefore, there were 15 people on the bus just before the terminal stop.

* **Two Stops Before Terminal:** 7 people got on and 15 people got off. To have 15 people on the bus before the terminal stop, there must have been 15 - 7 + 15 = 23 people on the bus at this point.

* **Stop Before Jose Boarded:** 5 people got on and 2 got off.  To have 23 people on the bus at this point, there must have been 23 - 5 + 2 = 10 people on the bus.

How many of each should he buy so there are an equal number of balloons, horns and candy bars in each basket?","To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 10, and 8, we find the prime factorization of each number:

* 20 = 2 x 2 x 5 = 2² x 5
* 10 = 2 x 5
* 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations: 2³ x 5 = 40

This means that to have an equal number of balloons, horns, and candy bars, Magellan needs to make baskets with multiples of 40 items.  Let's determine how many bags of each item he needs to achieve this:

* **Balloons:** 40 balloons / 20 balloons/bag = 2 bags of balloons
* **Horns:** 40 horns / 10 horns/bag = 4 bags of horns
* **Candy Bars:** 40 candy bars / 8 candy bars/package = 5 packages of candy bars

How many more marbles did Drew have than Marcus at first?,"Answer: Let's say Drew initially had 'x' marbles and Marcus initially had 'y' marbles.  After Drew gave 12 marbles to Marcus, Drew had x - 12 marbles and Marcus had y + 12 marbles.  We know that both boys then had 25 marbles each. So we can set up two equations:

* x - 12 = 25
* y + 12 = 25

Solving the first equation, we find x = 25 + 12 = 37.  Solving the second equation, we find y = 25 - 12 = 13.

Therefore, Drew initially had 37 marbles and Marcus initially had 13 marbles.  The difference is 37 - 13 = 24 marbles.

887,Eric has two pieces of rope. One piece is 10 inches longer than the other. The total length of the two pieces is 40 inches. How long is the shorter piece?,"Let's say the length of the shorter piece of rope is 'x' inches.
The longer piece is 10 inches longer, so its length is 'x + 10' inches.
The total length of both pieces is 40 inches, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 10) = 40
Combining like terms, we get:
2x + 10 = 40

890,"London is 11 years old and Blair is 16 years old. Several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London. How old was London then?","Let's say 'x' years ago, Blair was twice as old as London.

At that time, Blair's age would have been 16 - x, and London's age would have been 11 - x.

According to the problem, Blair's age at that time was twice London's age:

16 - x = 2 * (11 - x)

Now we can solve for x:

16 - x = 22 - 2x
2x - x = 22 - 16
x = 6

So, 6 years ago, Blair was twice as old as London.  To find London's age at that time, we subtract 6 from London's current age:

11 - 6 = 5

Therefore, London was 5 years old.

891,Anna has a total of 28 nickels and dimes in her piggy bank. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. How many dimes does Anna have?,"Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

* Let 'n' be the number of nickels Anna has.
* Let 'd' be the number of dimes Anna has.

We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** n + d = 28  (The total number of nickels and dimes is 28)
* **Equation 2:** n = d - 8  (She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes)

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dimes):

Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

(d - 8) + d = 28

Combine like terms:

2d - 8 = 28

Add 8 to both sides:

2d = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

d = 18

24 - 6 = 2x + x
18 = 3x
x = 6

Therefore, Mark gave Evan 6 marbles.

904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"Let's use variables to represent the number of apples in each bag:

* Let 'a' be the number of apples in the first bag.
* Let 'b' be the number of apples in the second bag.
* Let 'c' be the number of apples in the third bag.

We can translate the given information into equations:

* **Equation 1:** a + b + c = 24 (Total apples)
* **Equation 2:** a + b = 11 (Apples in first and second bags)
* **Equation 3:** b + c = 18 (Apples in second and third bags)

We want to find a + c.  Notice that if we subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1, we eliminate 'b' and get an expression involving 'a' and 'c':

(a + b + c) - (a + b) = 24 - 11
c = 13

Now substitute the value of 'c' (13) into Equation 3:

b + 13 = 18
b = 5

Finally, substitute the value of 'b' (5) into Equation 2:

a + 5 = 11
a = 6

Therefore, the first bag has 6 apples and the third bag has 13 apples.  The total number of apples in the first and third bags together is 6 + 13 = 19.

905,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,"Here's how to solve the worm problem:

**1. Net progress per day:** The worm climbs 8 inches but slides back 3 inches, resulting in a net progress of 8 - 3 = 5 inches per day.

**2. Days to reach almost the top:**  To reach the 26-inch depth, the worm needs to make a net progress of at least 26 inches.  Dividing the total depth by the daily net progress gives 26 / 5 = 5.2 days.  Since we can't have fractions of days, we round this up to 6 days.

**3. Verify progress on day 6:** After 5 days, the worm will have climbed 5 * 5 = 25 inches. On the sixth day, the worm climbs 8 inches, reaching a height of 25 + 8 = 33 inches. This is more than the 26-inch depth of the hole, so the worm successfully escapes on day 6.

906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find Rita and Peter's weight:** Since Rita and Peter weigh the same, their combined weight is half of their total weight.  We know the total weight is 90 pounds, so Rita + Peter = 90 pounds / 2 = 45 pounds.

2. **Find Skeeter's weight:** We know that Peter + Skeeter = 68 pounds. We also know that Peter weighs 45 pounds - Rita's weight (since Rita and Peter weigh the same amount). Therefore, we can substitute Peter's weight into the equation: (45 pounds - Rita's weight) + Skeeter = 68 pounds.  Since Rita and Peter weigh the same amount,  45 pounds + Skeeter = 68 pounds.

3. **Solve for Skeeter's weight:** Subtracting 45 pounds from both sides of the equation gives Skeeter's weight: Skeeter = 68 pounds - 45 pounds = 23 pounds.

909,"Alex, Brad, Calvin, and Dennis are playing checkers. Each of the 4 boys played 2 games with every other player. How many games of checkers were played altogether?","Here's how to solve the problem:

Each boy played 2 games against each of the other 3 boys.  So each boy played a total of 2 * 3 = 6 games.

Since there are 4 boys, we might think there were 4 * 6 = 24 games. However, this counts each game twice (once for each player involved).

To correct for this double counting, we divide by 2: (4 * 6) / 2 = 12 games.

Alternatively, we can think of it this way:  Alex plays 6 games.  Brad plays 4 more games (we don't count the games already played with Alex), Calvin plays 2 more games (not counting games already played with Alex and Brad), and Dennis plays 0 more games.  This gives us a total of 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 12 games.

978,"Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?","To find the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 10.

The prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3 = 2 x 3².
The prime factorization of 10 is 2 x 5.

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations: 2 x 3² x 5 = 2 x 9 x 5 = 90.

Therefore, the smallest number of ducks she could have observed is 90 (which is 5 flocks of 18 ducks).  This would correspond to 9 flocks of seagulls (9 x 10 = 90 seagulls).

1085,Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?,"To minimize the number of coins, Kira should have as many quarters as possible.

Since a quarter is worth $0.25, let's see how many quarters can fit into $1.20:

$1.20 / $0.25 = 4.8 quarters.  Since you can't have a fraction of a quarter, Kira has 4 quarters.

1087,"You have $12 in nickels and quarters. If you have the same number of each kind of coin, how many nickels do you have?","Answer: Let's say the number of nickels is 'n' and the number of quarters is 'q'.  We know that n = q (same number of each coin).

The value of the nickels is 0.05n dollars, and the value of the quarters is 0.25q dollars.  The total value is $12.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.05n + 0.25q = 12

Since n = q, we can substitute 'n' for 'q':  0.05n + 0.25n = 12

This simplifies to: 0.30n = 12

To solve for n, divide both sides by 0.30:  n = 12 / 0.30 = 40

Therefore, you have 40 nickels.

His first job pays $375 more than his second job, so his first job pays x + $375.
Together, his earnings from both jobs total $3875 per week.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + $375) = $3875

Combining like terms:

2x + $375 = $3875

Subtracting $375 from both sides:

2x = $3500

We can solve this system of equations.  Let's use substitution:

From the ratio equation, we can solve for 'c':  c = (7/3)i

Now substitute this value of 'c' into the difference equation:

(7/3)i - i = 20

Simplify and solve for 'i':

(4/3)i = 20
i = (3/4) * 20
i = 15

Now that we know 'i' (the number of incorrect answers), we can find 'c' (the number of correct answers):

c = (7/3) * 15
c = 35

The total number of questions on the test is the sum of correct and incorrect answers:

Total questions = c + i = 35 + 15 = 50

She wants each arrangement to have the same number of each color. What is the greatest number of arrangements that she can make if every balloon is used?","To find the greatest number of identical balloon arrangements Shannon can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of maroon, white, and orange balloons.

The number of maroon balloons is 32.
The number of white balloons is 24.
The number of orange balloons is 16.

We find the GCD of 32, 24, and 16.

24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2³ × 3
16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2⁴

The common prime factors are 2³, which is 8.  Therefore, the GCD of 32, 24, and 16 is 8.

This means Shannon can make 8 identical balloon arrangements, with each arrangement containing:
32 maroon balloons / 8 arrangements = 4 maroon balloons per arrangement
24 white balloons / 8 arrangements = 3 white balloons per arrangement
16 orange balloons / 8 arrangements = 2 orange balloons per arrangement

1243,"A school had 14 students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?","Explanation:
First, find the total number of students needed for 4 teams with the same number of students on each team.  Since there are 4 teams, and we want an equal number of students per team, we must divide the total number of students by the number of teams. In this case, we divide 14 students by 4 teams, which results in 3 students per team with a remainder of 2 students.  To have an equal number of students on each team, each team would need 4 students (16 total students).  This means we currently have 2 fewer students than we need. To determine how many more students are needed, we subtract the current number of students (14) from the ideal number of students (16).  Therefore, 2 more students are needed to make 4 teams of 4 students each.

1294,"Pete, Bryan and Philip are cousins. Pete's age is one-third of Bryan and Philip is five years elder than Bryan. If the sum of the age of the cousins is 40, find the ages of each.","Let's use variables to represent the ages:

* Let P represent Pete's age.
* Let B represent Bryan's age.
* Let H represent Philip's age.

We can translate the given information into equations:

* **Equation 1:** P = B/3  (Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's age)
* **Equation 2:** H = B + 5 (Philip is five years older than Bryan)
* **Equation 3:** P + B + H = 40 (The sum of their ages is 40)

Now we can solve for the ages:

Substitute Equation 1 and Equation 2 into Equation 3:

(B/3) + B + (B + 5) = 40

Combine like terms:

(B/3) + 2B + 5 = 40

Subtract 5 from both sides:

(B/3) + 2B = 35

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

B + 6B = 105

Combine like terms:

7B = 105

Divide both sides by 7:

B = 15

Now that we know Bryan's age (B = 15), we can find Pete's and Philip's ages:

* **Pete's age (P):** P = B/3 = 15/3 = 5
* **Philip's age (H):** H = B + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20

Therefore, Pete is 5 years old, Bryan is 15 years old, and Philip is 20 years old.

Answer: {Pete: 5, Bryan: 15, Philip: 20}

1295,Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.,"Let's use variables to represent their ages:

* Let 'x' represent Jack's age.
* Ana is 5 years older than Jack, so Ana's age is 'x + 5'.

The problem states that the sum of their ages is 29, so we can write an equation:

x + (x + 5) = 29

Now we solve for x:

2x + 5 = 29
2x = 24
x = 12

So, Jack's age (x) is 12 years old.  Ana's age is x + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 years old.

Answer: {Jack is 12, Ana is 17}
"
1296,Tina is 3 years younger than Tom. The ages are in the ratio 2:3. Find their ages.,"Let's say Tom's age is T and Tina's age is N.
We know that Tina is 3 years younger than Tom, so we can write this as:
N = T - 3

We also know that their ages are in the ratio 2:3.  This means:
N/T = 2/3

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(T - 3) / T = 2/3

To solve for T, we can cross-multiply:
3(T - 3) = 2T
3T - 9 = 2T
3T - 2T = 9
T = 9

Now that we know Tom's age (T) is 9, we can find Tina's age (N):
N = T - 3
N = 9 - 3
N = 6

Therefore, Tom is 9 years old and Tina is 6 years old.

Answer: {Tom is 9, Tina is 6}
"
1297,"George is 8 years more than Christopher and Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher. The sum of their ages is 60. Find the ages of George, Christopher and Ford.","Let's use variables to represent the ages:

* Let C represent Christopher's age.
* George is 8 years older than Christopher, so George's age is C + 8.
* Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher, so Ford's age is C - 2.

The sum of their ages is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + (C + 8) + (C - 2) = 60

Now we solve for C:

3C + 6 = 60
3C = 54
C = 18

So, Christopher is 18 years old.

Now we can find the ages of George and Ford:

* George's age: C + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26
* Ford's age: C - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16

Answer: {George: 26, Christopher: 18, Ford: 16}

"
1302,Nick and Kane were born on consecutive years and on same date. Nick is younger.  The sum of their ages is 11. Find the age of the brothers.,"Let Nick's age be N and Kane's age be K.
Since they were born on consecutive years and Nick is younger, Kane is one year older than Nick.  Therefore, K = N + 1.
The sum of their ages is 11, so N + K = 11.
Substitute K = N + 1 into the equation N + K = 11:
N + (N + 1) = 11
2N + 1 = 11
2N = 10
N = 5
Therefore, Nick's age is 5 years old.
Kane's age is K = N + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 years old.

The sum of their ages is 4x + 7x = 11x.
We are given that the sum of their ages is 22, so 11x = 22.
Dividing both sides by 11, we get x = 2.
Therefore, Ashley's age is 4x = 4 * 2 = 8 years old, and Mary's age is 7x = 7 * 2 = 14 years old.

Answer: {Ashley is 8 years old, Mary is 14 years old}
"
1304,"The ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. Find the ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack.","Let Peter's age be x, Margaret's age be x+2, and Jack's age be x+4, where x is an odd number.  The problem states that Peter's age plus Margaret's age equals Jack's age five years ago. This can be written as an equation:

x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 2 = x - 1

Subtracting x from both sides:

x + 2 = -1

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

x = -3

Since age cannot be negative, we've made an error in interpreting the problem.  Let's re-examine the statement: ""The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years.""  This means the sum of Peter and Margaret's current ages equals what Jack's age *was* 5 years ago.  The correct equation is:

x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) - 5

Simplifying:

2x + 2 = x - 1

x = -3

Again we get a negative number which is not possible. There must be a mistake in the problem statement.  Let's assume there's a typo and the problem meant to say ""Jack's age *in* 5 years"".  The equation would then be:

x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) + 5

2x + 2 = x + 9

x = 7

Therefore:

* Peter's age = x = 7
* Margaret's age = x + 2 = 9
* Jack's age = x + 4 = 11

These are consecutive odd numbers. Let's check: 7 + 9 = 16.  Jack's age 5 years ago would be 11 - 5 = 6. This still doesn't work perfectly with the given condition. However, given the options we have, this is the only sensible solution.

Answer: {Peter: 7, Margaret: 9, Jack: 11}
"
1305,"The sum of the ages of Tony and Teddy equals their mother's age. Tony is two years younger than Teddy. If the age of the mother is 42, find the ages of Tony and Teddy?","Let T represent Teddy's age and N represent Tony's age.
We know that Tony is two years younger than Teddy, so we can write this as:
N = T - 2

We also know that the sum of Tony and Teddy's ages equals their mother's age, which is 42.  So we can write:
N + T = 42

Now we can substitute the first equation (N = T - 2) into the second equation:
(T - 2) + T = 42

Combine like terms:
2T - 2 = 42

Add 2 to both sides:
2T = 44

Divide both sides by 2:
T = 22

Now that we know Teddy's age (T = 22), we can find Tony's age using the first equation:
N = T - 2
N = 22 - 2
N = 20

Therefore, Teddy is 22 years old and Tony is 20 years old.

Answer: {Teddy is 22, Tony is 20}

1306,"At present Allen is 10 years younger than Scott. Five years from now, Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen. Find the present age of Allen and Scott.","Let A represent Allen's current age and S represent Scott's current age.
We are given that Allen is 10 years younger than Scott, so we can write this as:
S = A + 10  (Equation 1)

Five years from now, Scott's age will be S + 5, and Allen's current age will be A.  We are told that Scott's age in five years will be twice Allen's current age:
S + 5 = 2A  (Equation 2)

Now we can solve this system of equations. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(A + 10) + 5 = 2A
A + 15 = 2A
15 = A

So Allen's current age is 15 years.  Now we can find Scott's current age using Equation 1:
S = A + 10
S = 15 + 10
S = 25

Therefore, Allen's current age is 15 and Scott's current age is 25.

Answer: {Allen: 15, Scott: 25}

We are given that the ratio of their present ages is 1:2, so we can write:
L/B = 1/2
This implies that B = 2L.

Three years from now, Lewis's age will be L + 3 and Brown's age will be B + 3.
The ratio of their ages three years from now is 3:5, so we can write:
(L + 3) / (B + 3) = 3/5

Substitute B = 2L into the second equation:
(L + 3) / (2L + 3) = 3/5

Cross-multiply:
5(L + 3) = 3(2L + 3)
5L + 15 = 6L + 9
6L - 5L = 15 - 9
L = 6

Now substitute L = 6 back into B = 2L:
B = 2 * 6 = 12

Therefore, Lewis's present age is 6 and Brown's present age is 12.

Answer: {Lewis: 6, Brown: 12}

The problem states: ""Thrice the sum of a number and 2 equals 24 added with the same number"".  We can translate this into an algebraic equation:

3(x + 2) = 24 + x

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Distribute the 3 on the left side:  3x + 6 = 24 + x
2. Subtract x from both sides: 2x + 6 = 24
3. Subtract 6 from both sides: 2x = 18
4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

Therefore, the number is 9.

1313,"The difference of two numbers is 100. If one of the numbers is 91, find the other number.","Answer: Let the two numbers be x and y.  The problem states that their difference is 100, so we can write this as an equation: x - y = 100 (or y - x = 100). We are given that one of the numbers is 91. Let's assume x = 91.  Substituting this into the equation, we get: 91 - y = 100.  Solving for y, we subtract 91 from both sides: -y = 100 - 91, which simplifies to -y = 9. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get y = -9.  Alternatively, if we assume y = 91, then the equation becomes x - 91 = 100.  Adding 91 to both sides, we get x = 191. Therefore, the other number is either -9 or 191.

Answer: {191}

1323,One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.,"Let the number be x.
One-third of the number is (1/3)x.
One-fifth is (1/5).
Eight-fifteenth of the number is (8/15)x.

According to the problem, one-third of the number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number.  This can be written as an equation:

(1/3)x + (1/5) = (8/15)x

To solve for x, we first need to get rid of the fractions. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 5, and 15, which is 15:

15 * [(1/3)x + (1/5)] = 15 * [(8/15)x]

This simplifies to:

5x + 3 = 8x

Now, subtract 5x from both sides:

3 = 3x

Finally, divide both sides by 3:

x = 1

Let's check our answer:

(1/3)(1) + (1/5) = (8/15)(1)
(1/3) + (1/5) = (8/15)
(5/15) + (3/15) = (8/15)
(8/15) = (8/15)

1342,In an isosceles triangle one of the angles of a triangle is 54 degrees. Find the base angles of the triangle.,"An isosceles triangle has two angles that are equal.  If one angle is 54 degrees, there are two possibilities:

**Possibility 1:** The 54-degree angle is one of the base angles.

In this case, the other base angle is also 54 degrees.  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, the third angle (the apex angle) would be 180 - 54 - 54 = 72 degrees.

**Possibility 2:** The 54-degree angle is the apex angle (the angle between the two equal sides).

In this case, let x be the measure of each of the base angles.  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we have:

54 + x + x = 180
2x = 180 - 54
2x = 126
x = 63

Therefore, each base angle would be 63 degrees.

The question asks for the base angles.  Since it doesn't specify which angle is 54 degrees, we must consider both possibilities.  However, the phrasing of the question suggests that the 54-degree angle is one of the base angles (if the apex angle were 54, that would be more explicitly stated).  To be complete, both scenarios must be acknowledged.

1344,"A rectangular swimming pool was constructed for Kids at Hotel Park. The length of the swimming pool is twice its width. If the length is 16 ft, find the width and area of the pool.","The problem states that the length of the rectangular swimming pool is twice its width.  We are given that the length is 16 feet.  Therefore, we can set up an equation to find the width:

Length = 2 * Width

16 ft = 2 * Width

To solve for the width, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Width = 16 ft / 2 = 8 ft

Now that we know the width is 8 feet, we can calculate the area of the pool using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length * Width

Area = 16 ft * 8 ft = 128 sq ft

Therefore, the width of the pool is 8 feet and the area is 128 square feet.

1346,The angles of a triangle are in the ratio 1:2:3. Find each angle of the triangle.,"The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Let the angles of the triangle be x, 2x, and 3x.  Since these represent all the angles in the triangle, their sum must be 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find the value of x:

x = 30

Now we can find each angle:

* First angle: x = 30 degrees
* Second angle: 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
* Third angle: 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 30, 60, and 90 degrees.

1347,If the second angle is 32 degree less than thrice the first angle and the third angle is 28 degree less than twice the first angle. Find the angles of the triangle.,"Let's denote the three angles of the triangle as A, B, and C.  We are given relationships between these angles:

* **Angle B** is 32 degrees less than thrice Angle A.  This can be written as: B = 3A - 32
* **Angle C** is 28 degrees less than twice Angle A. This can be written as: C = 2A - 28

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore:

A + B + C = 180

Now we can substitute the expressions for B and C into this equation:

A + (3A - 32) + (2A - 28) = 180

Combine like terms:

6A - 60 = 180

Add 60 to both sides:

6A = 240

Divide by 6:

A = 40

Now that we know Angle A is 40 degrees, we can find Angles B and C:

B = 3A - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 120 - 32 = 88
C = 2A - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 80 - 28 = 52

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 40, 88, and 52 degrees.  Let's check if they add up to 180: 40 + 88 + 52 = 180.  They do!

Answer: {40, 88, 52}

1349,A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same. The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.,"The field consists of a rectangle and an equilateral triangle.  The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangle, which is 42 ft. The length of the rectangle is 76 ft.

The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (76 + 42) = 2 * 118 = 236 ft.

The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3 * side length = 3 * 42 = 126 ft.

However, the width of the rectangle and one side of the triangle are shared, so we need to subtract that shared side once.

The total perimeter of the field is the perimeter of the rectangle + the perimeter of the triangle - the shared side.  So it's 236 + 126 - 42 = 320 ft.

1393,"A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.","Let the son's current age be 'x' years.
The man's current age is thrice his son's age, so the man's current age is 3x years.

After 12 years:
The son's age will be x + 12 years.
The man's age will be 3x + 12 years.

At that time, the man will be twice as old as his son:
3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)
3x + 12 = 2x + 24
3x - 2x = 24 - 12
x = 12

Therefore, the son's current age is 12 years.

1399,Mrs.Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. After 8 years she will be twice as old as Neil. Find their present ages.,"Let's use variables to represent their ages:

* Let N represent Neil's current age.
* Let M represent Mrs. Martin's current age.

We can translate the given information into equations:

* **Equation 1:** M = N + 27  (Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than Neil)
* **Equation 2:** M + 8 = 2(N + 8)  (In 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil)

Now we can solve this system of equations.  Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

(N + 27) + 8 = 2(N + 8)

Simplify and solve for N:

N + 35 = 2N + 16
35 - 16 = 2N - N
19 = N

Neil's current age (N) is 19 years.

Now substitute N = 19 back into Equation 1 to find Mrs. Martin's age:

M = 19 + 27
M = 46

Mrs. Martin's current age (M) is 46 years.

1400,"In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The vertex angle is twice either base angle. What are the angles of the triangle?","Let the base angles of the isosceles triangle be x degrees each.
Since the vertex angle is twice either base angle, the vertex angle is 2x degrees.
The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
Therefore, we have the equation: x + x + 2x = 180
Combining like terms, we get: 4x = 180
Dividing both sides by 4, we find: x = 45
So, the base angles are 45 degrees each, and the vertex angle is 2 * 45 = 90 degrees.

1401,"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?","Let's say the first boy has 'x' marbles and the second boy has 'y' marbles.  We know that x + y = 480.

The first boy arranges his marbles in heaps of 6, so he has x/6 heaps.
The second boy arranges his marbles in heaps of 9, so he has y/9 heaps.

The total number of heaps is 72, so we have the equation: x/6 + y/9 = 72.

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) x + y = 480
2) x/6 + y/9 = 72

We can solve this system of equations. Let's solve the first equation for x:  x = 480 - y.

Now substitute this value of x into the second equation:

(480 - y)/6 + y/9 = 72

Multiply both sides by 18 (the least common multiple of 6 and 9) to eliminate the fractions:

3(480 - y) + 2y = 72 * 18
1440 - 3y + 2y = 1296
1440 - y = 1296
y = 144

Now substitute the value of y back into the equation x = 480 - y:

x = 480 - 144
x = 336

Therefore, the first boy has 336 marbles, and the second boy has 144 marbles.

1404,"Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.","Let's denote the width of the rectangle as 'w' meters.
The length of the rectangle is 8 meters less than twice its width, so the length can be represented as '2w - 8' meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
We are given that the perimeter is 56 meters.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

56 = 2 * ( (2w - 8) + w )

Now we solve for 'w':

56 = 2 * (3w - 8)
56 = 6w - 16
56 + 16 = 6w
72 = 6w
w = 72 / 6
w = 12 meters

Now that we know the width (w = 12 meters), we can find the length:

Length = 2w - 8 = 2 * 12 - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16 meters

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 12 meters and the length is 16 meters.

Answer: {width = 12 m, length = 16 m}

1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","Let J represent Jacob's current age and S represent his son's current age.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1 (Five years hence):** J + 5 = 3(S + 5)  This translates to ""In five years, Jacob's age will be three times his son's age.""
* **Equation 2 (Five years ago):** J - 5 = 7(S - 5) This translates to ""Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times his son's age.""

Now we can solve this system of equations. Let's simplify Equation 1:

J + 5 = 3S + 15
J = 3S + 10

Substitute this value of J into Equation 2:

(3S + 10) - 5 = 7(S - 5)
3S + 5 = 7S - 35
4S = 40
S = 10

Now that we know S (the son's current age) is 10, we can substitute this value back into either Equation 1 or 2 to find J (Jacob's current age). Let's use the simplified Equation 1:

J = 3S + 10
J = 3(10) + 10
J = 40

Therefore, Jacob's current age is 40 and his son's current age is 10.

Answer: {Jacob's current age is 40, his son's current age is 10}

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Let's use variables to represent the ages:

* Let 'x' represent the son's current age.
* Let 'y' represent the father's current age.

Five years ago:

* Son's age: x - 5
* Father's age: y - 5

The problem states that five years ago, the father was thrice as old as his son:

* y - 5 = 3(x - 5)

Ten years later:

* Son's age: x + 10
* Father's age: y + 10

The problem states that ten years later, the father will be twice as old as his son:

* y + 10 = 2(x + 10)


Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) y - 5 = 3(x - 5)
2) y + 10 = 2(x + 10)


Let's solve for x and y:

From equation (1):  y - 5 = 3x - 15  =>  y = 3x - 10

Substitute this value of y into equation (2):

(3x - 10) + 10 = 2x + 20

3x = 2x + 20

x = 20  (Son's current age)

Now substitute x = 20 back into the equation y = 3x - 10:

y = 3(20) - 10

y = 50  (Father's current age)

Therefore, the son is currently 20 years old, and the father is currently 50 years old.

Answer: {Son: 20, Father: 50}

1408,A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,"Let's denote the ages as follows:
* A = A's age
* B = B's age
* C = C's age
* D = D's age

We are given the following information:
1. A = B + 2  (A is two years older than B)
2. D = 2A  (D is twice as old as A)
3. B = 2C  (B is twice as old as C)
4. D - C = 40 (The ages of D and C differ by 40 years)

We can use these equations to solve for A and B.  Let's substitute equations 1 and 3 into equation 4:

From equation 3, we have C = B/2. Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

D - B/2 = 40

From equation 2, we have D = 2A. Substituting this into the equation above:

2A - B/2 = 40

Now we can substitute equation 1 (A = B + 2) into this equation:

2(B + 2) - B/2 = 40

2B + 4 - B/2 = 40

Multiplying by 2 to eliminate fractions:

4B + 8 - B = 80

3B = 72

B = 24

Now that we know B's age, we can find A's age using equation 1:

A = B + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26

Therefore, A is 26 years old and B is 24 years old.

Answer: {A = 26, B = 24}

Two years ago, the father's age was F - 2 and the son's age was S - 2.  According to the problem, the father was five times as old as his son two years ago:

F - 2 = 5(S - 2)
F - 2 = 5S - 10
F = 5S - 8  (Equation 1)

Two years later, the father's age will be F + 2 and the son's age will be S + 2.  The father's age will be 8 more than the son's age:

F + 2 = S + 2 + 8
F + 2 = S + 10
F = S + 8  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

Equation 1: F = 5S - 8
Equation 2: F = S + 8

Since both equations are equal to F, we can set them equal to each other:

5S - 8 = S + 8
4S = 16
S = 4

Now substitute S = 4 into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find F:

F = S + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12

Therefore, the father's current age is 12 and the son's current age is 4.

1410,Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the age of father.,"Let F be the father's current age, and let C1 and C2 be the current ages of his two children.
We are given that the father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children.  This can be written as:

F = 3(C1 + C2)   (Equation 1)

After 5 years, the father's age will be F + 5, and the children's ages will be C1 + 5 and C2 + 5.  We are given that after 5 years, his age will be twice the sum of the ages of his two children. This can be written as:

F + 5 = 2((C1 + 5) + (C2 + 5))   (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with three unknowns. Let's simplify Equation 2:

F + 5 = 2(C1 + C2 + 10)
F + 5 = 2(C1 + C2) + 20
F = 2(C1 + C2) + 15   (Equation 3)

Now we can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 3:

3(C1 + C2) = 2(C1 + C2) + 15
3(C1 + C2) - 2(C1 + C2) = 15
(C1 + C2) = 15

Now substitute this back into Equation 1:

F = 3(15)
F = 45

Therefore, the father's current age is 45.

1411,5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.,"Let F be the father's current age and S be the son's current age.

Five years hence (in the future):
The father's age will be F + 5
The son's age will be S + 5
According to the problem, the father's age will be three times the son's age:
F + 5 = 3(S + 5)
F + 5 = 3S + 15
F = 3S + 10  (Equation 1)

Five years earlier (in the past):
The father's age was F - 5
The son's age was S - 5
According to the problem, the father's age was seven times the son's age:
F - 5 = 7(S - 5)
F - 5 = 7S - 35
F = 7S - 30  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
Equation 1: F = 3S + 10
Equation 2: F = 7S - 30

Since both equations are equal to F, we can set them equal to each other:
3S + 10 = 7S - 30
4S = 40
S = 10

Now substitute the value of S back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find F. Let's use Equation 1:
F = 3(10) + 10
F = 30 + 10
F = 40

Therefore, the father's current age is 40 and the son's current age is 10.

We are given that the father's age is equal to the sum of the ages of his five children.  This can be written as:

F = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5

After 15 years, the father's age will be F + 15, and the sum of the children's ages will be (C1 + 15) + (C2 + 15) + (C3 + 15) + (C4 + 15) + (C5 + 15) = (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5) + 75.

We are given that after 15 years, the sum of the children's ages will be twice the father's age.  This can be written as:

(C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5) + 75 = 2(F + 15)

Since F = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5, we can substitute F into the second equation:

F + 75 = 2(F + 15)
F + 75 = 2F + 30
75 - 30 = 2F - F
45 = F

Therefore, the father's current age is 45.

1413,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.","Let the present ages of the father be F, and the present ages of the two sons be S1 and S2.
We are given that S1 = S2 + 2.  Also, S1 + S2 = F - 14.

Ten years ago, the sum of the sons' ages was (S1 - 10) + (S2 - 10) = S1 + S2 - 20.
Ten years ago, the father's age was F - 10.
We are given that ten years ago, the sum of the sons' ages was one-third the father's age:
S1 + S2 - 20 = (1/3)(F - 10)

Substitute S1 + S2 = F - 14 into the equation above:
F - 14 - 20 = (1/3)(F - 10)
F - 34 = (1/3)(F - 10)
3(F - 34) = F - 10
3F - 102 = F - 10
2F = 92
F = 46

Now we can find the sons' ages:
S1 + S2 = F - 14 = 46 - 14 = 32
S1 = S2 + 2
Substitute S1 = S2 + 2 into S1 + S2 = 32:
S2 + 2 + S2 = 32
2S2 = 30
S2 = 15
S1 = S2 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

Therefore, the father's present age is 46, and the sons' present ages are 17 and 15.

Answer: {Father: 46, Son 1: 17, Son 2: 15}
"
1414,"If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. Find the ages of father and son.","Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

* Let 'f' represent the father's age.
* Let 's' represent the son's age.

We can translate the given information into two equations:

* **Equation 1:** 2s + f = 70  (Twice the son's age plus the father's age equals 70)
* **Equation 2:** s + 2f = 95  (The son's age plus twice the father's age equals 95)

Now we can solve this system of equations.  One way to do this is using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

1. **Multiply Equation 1 by 2:** This gives us 4s + 2f = 140.

2. **Subtract Equation 2 from the modified Equation 1:**  (4s + 2f) - (s + 2f) = 140 - 95. This simplifies to 3s = 45.

3. **Solve for s:** Divide both sides by 3: s = 15.  The son is 15 years old.

4. **Substitute the value of s back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for f.** Let's use Equation 1: 2(15) + f = 70.  This simplifies to 30 + f = 70.

5. **Solve for f:** Subtract 30 from both sides: f = 40. The father is 40 years old.

Therefore, the father is 40 years old and the son is 15 years old.

Answer: {Father: 40, Son: 15}
"
1415,"I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?","Let's use variables to represent the ages:

* Let 'x' represent the son's current age.
* Let '3x' represent the father's current age (since the father is three times as old as his son).

In five years:

* The son's age will be x + 5.
* The father's age will be 3x + 5.

The problem states that in five years, the father will be two and a half times as old as his son.  We can write this as an equation:

3x + 5 = 2.5 * (x + 5)

Now let's solve for x:

3x + 5 = 2.5x + 12.5
0.5x = 7.5
x = 15

So, the son's current age is 15 years old.  The father's current age is 3 * 15 = 45 years old.

Answer: {Father: 45, Son: 15}
"
1416,The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.,"Let F be the father's current age and S be the son's current age.
We are given that the sum of their current ages is 55 years:
F + S = 55  (Equation 1)

Let x be the number of years until the son's age equals the father's current age.  Then, in x years:
The father's age will be F + x
The son's age will be S + x = F

At that time, the sum of their ages will be 93 years:
(F + x) + (S + x) = 93
F + S + 2x = 93  (Equation 2)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
55 + 2x = 93
2x = 93 - 55
2x = 38
x = 19

Now we know that in 19 years, the son's age will equal the father's current age.  Therefore:
S + 19 = F
Substitute this into Equation 1:
F + (F - 19) = 55
2F - 19 = 55
2F = 74
F = 37

Now find the son's age:
S = 55 - F = 55 - 37 = 18

Therefore, the father's current age is 37 years and the son's current age is 18 years.

Answer: {Father: 37, Son: 18}
"
1417,The ages of two friends Anna and Ben differ by 3 years. Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years. Find the ages of Anna and Ben.,"Let A be Anna's age, B be Ben's age, D be Denver's age, and C be Cathy's age.
We are given that the ages of Anna and Ben differ by 3 years.  This can be expressed as:
A = B + 3  or  B = A + 3

Denver is twice as old as Anna:
D = 2A

Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy:
B = 2C

The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years:
D = C + 30  or  C = D - 30

Now we can solve this system of equations.  Let's substitute the equations into each other:

Since D = 2A and D = C + 30, we can say 2A = C + 30.
Since B = 2C and B = A + 3 (or A = B -3 depending which assumption we make earlier), we can say A + 3 = 2C. (or A = 2C-3)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (A and C):
1) 2A = C + 30
2) A + 3 = 2C

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.  Solve equation (2) for A:
A = 2C - 3

Substitute this value of A into equation (1):
2(2C - 3) = C + 30
4C - 6 = C + 30
3C = 36
C = 12

Now substitute C = 12 back into A = 2C - 3:
A = 2(12) - 3
A = 21

Now we can find Ben's age:
B = A + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24

Therefore, Anna is 21 years old and Ben is 24 years old.

Answer: {Anna is 21, Ben is 24}

1418,"Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?","Let N be Nancy's current age and S be Sam's current age.

Five years ago, Nancy was N - 5 years old and Sam was S - 5 years old.  At that time, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

N - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Ten years later, Nancy will be N + 10 years old and Sam will be S + 10 years old. At that time, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

N + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) N - 5 = 3(S - 5)
2) N + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Let's solve for N and S.  We can simplify equation 1:

N - 5 = 3S - 15
N = 3S - 10

Now substitute this expression for N into equation 2:

(3S - 10) + 10 = 2(S + 10)
3S = 2S + 20
S = 20

Now substitute S = 20 back into the equation N = 3S - 10:

N = 3(20) - 10
N = 60 - 10
N = 50

Therefore, Nancy is currently 50 years old and Sam is currently 20 years old.

Answer: {Nancy is 50, Sam is 20}

1419,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.,"Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' and 'b' are digits.
The problem states that the sum of the digits is 3, so we have:
a + b = 3

Reversing the order of the digits gives the number 10b + a.
The problem states that seven times the original number is equal to four times the reversed number:
7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)
70a + 7b = 40b + 4a
66a = 33b
2a = b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) a + b = 3
2) 2a = b

Substitute the second equation into the first:
a + 2a = 3
3a = 3
a = 1

Now substitute a = 1 back into the second equation:
2(1) = b
b = 2

Therefore, the original two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 2 = 12.

Let's check:
7 * 12 = 84
4 * 21 = 84
The equations hold true.

1420,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.,"Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' and 'b' are the tens and units digits, respectively.  We are given that:

* **Equation 1:** 10a + b = 4(a + b)  (The number is four times the sum of its digits)
* **Equation 2:** 10a + b = 2(ab)     (The number is twice the product of its digits)

Let's simplify Equation 1:

10a + b = 4a + 4b
6a = 3b
2a = b

Now substitute b = 2a into Equation 2:

10a + 2a = 2(a * 2a)
12a = 4a²
3 = a  (Assuming a is not 0)

Since b = 2a, and a = 3, then b = 2 * 3 = 6.

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(3) + 6 = 36.

Let's check if this satisfies both conditions:

* **Equation 1:** 36 = 4(3 + 6) = 4(9) = 36 (True)
* **Equation 2:** 36 = 2(3 * 6) = 2(18) = 36 (True)

Answer: {36}

1421,"A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.","Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' and 'b' are the tens and units digits, respectively.

We are given that the number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits:

10a + b = 7(a + b)  (Equation 1)

We are also given that when 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places:

10a + b - 27 = 10b + a  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. Let's solve for 'a' and 'b'.

From Equation 1:
10a + b = 7a + 7b
3a = 6b
a = 2b  (Equation 3)

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
10(2b) + b - 27 = 10b + 2b
20b + b - 27 = 12b
21b - 12b = 27
9b = 27
b = 3

Now substitute b = 3 back into Equation 3:
a = 2 * 3
a = 6

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(6) + 3 = 63.

Let's check if this satisfies both conditions:

Condition 1: 63 = 7(6 + 3) = 7(9) = 63 (True)
Condition 2: 63 - 27 = 36 (True)

Answer: {63}

1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.","Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.
We are given that the sum of the digits is 9, so we have the equation:
a + b = 9  (Equation 1)

If the digits are reversed, the new number is 10b + a.  We are told that this reversed number is 9 more than the original number, so we have:
10b + a = 10a + b + 9  (Equation 2)

Now we can solve this system of equations.  Let's simplify Equation 2:
9b - 9a = 9
b - a = 1  (Equation 3)

Now we have two equations:
a + b = 9
b - a = 1

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:
(a + b) + (b - a) = 9 + 1
2b = 10
b = 5

Substitute b = 5 into Equation 1:
a + 5 = 9
a = 4

Therefore, the original two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(4) + 5 = 45.

1423,The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.,"Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' and 'b' are the digits.
We are given that the sum of the digits is 15, so a + b = 15.
When the number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed. This can be written as:
10a + b - 27 = 10b + a
Simplifying this equation:
9a - 9b = 27
Dividing by 9:
a - b = 3
Now we have a system of two linear equations:
a + b = 15
a - b = 3
Adding the two equations, we get:
2a = 18
a = 9
Substituting a = 9 into a + b = 15:
9 + b = 15
b = 6
Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(9) + 6 = 96.

Answer: {96}

We are given that the tens digit is three times the units digit, so we can write this as:  a = 3b

When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. This can be written as:
10a + b - 54 = 10b + a

Now we can substitute a = 3b into the second equation:
10(3b) + b - 54 = 10b + 3b
30b + b - 54 = 13b
31b - 54 = 13b
31b - 13b = 54
18b = 54
b = 54 / 18
b = 3

Now that we know b = 3, we can find a:
a = 3b = 3 * 3 = 9

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(9) + 3 = 93

Let's check our answer:
93 - 54 = 39 (The digits are reversed)

1425,The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 8 and the difference between the number and that formed by reversing the digits is 18. Find the number.,"Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' and 'b' are digits.
We are given that the sum of the digits is 8, so we have:
a + b = 8  (Equation 1)

When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10b + a.
The difference between the original number and the reversed number is 18, so we have:
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 18
10a + b - 10b - a = 18
9a - 9b = 18
Dividing by 9, we get:
a - b = 2  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
a + b = 8
a - b = 2

Adding the two equations, we get:
2a = 10
a = 5

Substituting a = 5 into Equation 1:
5 + b = 8
b = 3

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(5) + 3 = 53.

1426,"A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.","Let's denote:

* **x:** the speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr)
* **y:** the speed of the stream (in km/hr)

When the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is (x - y) km/hr (because the stream opposes the boat's motion).
When the boat goes downstream, its effective speed is (x + y) km/hr (because the stream helps the boat's motion).

We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

**Equation 1 (10 hours):**

Time = Distance / Speed
Upstream time + Downstream time = 10 hours
(30 / (x - y)) + (44 / (x + y)) = 10

**Equation 2 (13 hours):**

Upstream time + Downstream time = 13 hours
(40 / (x - y)) + (55 / (x + y)) = 13

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns.  Solving this system requires some algebraic manipulation. Let's use substitution or elimination.  Substitution is often easier in this case.

Let's simplify the equations by making substitutions:

Let a = 1/(x - y) and b = 1/(x + y)

Our equations become:

30a + 44b = 10     (Equation 1')
40a + 55b = 13     (Equation 2')


We can solve this system using elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. Multiply Equation 1' by 4 and Equation 2' by -3:

120a + 176b = 40
-120a - 165b = -39

Adding these two equations eliminates 'a':

11b = 1
b = 1/11

Substitute b = 1/11 back into Equation 1':

30a + 44(1/11) = 10
30a + 4 = 10
30a = 6
a = 1/5

Now we can find x and y:

a = 1/(x - y) = 1/5  => x - y = 5
b = 1/(x + y) = 1/11 => x + y = 11

Adding these two equations:

2x = 16
x = 8 km/hr (speed of the boat in still water)

Substitute x = 8 into x - y = 5:

8 - y = 5
y = 3 km/hr (speed of the stream)


Answer: {Boat speed: 8 km/hr, Stream speed: 3 km/hr}

1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.","Let's denote Tara's speed of rowing in still water as 'r' km/hour and the speed of the current as 'c' km/hour.

When rowing downstream, Tara's effective speed is the sum of her rowing speed and the current's speed (r + c).  We know she covers 20 km in 2 hours downstream, so her downstream speed is 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/hour.  Therefore, we have the equation:

r + c = 10  (Equation 1)

When rowing upstream, Tara's effective speed is the difference between her rowing speed and the current's speed (r - c). She covers 4 km in 2 hours upstream, so her upstream speed is 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/hour.  Therefore, we have the equation:

r - c = 2  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:

(r + c) + (r - c) = 10 + 2
2r = 12
r = 6

Now that we know r (Tara's rowing speed in still water) is 6 km/hour, we can substitute this value back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for c (the speed of the current). Let's use Equation 1:

6 + c = 10
c = 4

Therefore, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/hour, and the speed of the current is 4 km/hour.

Answer: {6 km/hour, 4 km/hour}

1428,A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.,"Let's denote:

* **v<sub>s</sub>:** the speed of the sailor in still water (in km/minute)
* **v<sub>c</sub>:** the speed of the current (in km/minute)

**Downstream:**

When going downstream, the sailor's speed is the sum of their speed in still water and the speed of the current: v<sub>s</sub> + v<sub>c</sub>.  The distance covered is 8 km, and the time taken is 40 minutes.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

8 km = (v<sub>s</sub> + v<sub>c</sub>) * 40 minutes

**Upstream:**

When going upstream, the sailor's speed is the difference between their speed in still water and the speed of the current: v<sub>s</sub> - v<sub>c</sub>. The distance covered is still 8 km, and the time taken is 60 minutes (1 hour).  Therefore, we have:

8 km = (v<sub>s</sub> - v<sub>c</sub>) * 60 minutes

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) 8 = 40(v<sub>s</sub> + v<sub>c</sub>)
2) 8 = 60(v<sub>s</sub> - v<sub>c</sub>)

Let's simplify these equations:

1) 1/5 = v<sub>s</sub> + v<sub>c</sub>
2) 2/15 = v<sub>s</sub> - v<sub>c</sub>

Now we can solve this system of equations.  Adding equation 1 and equation 2, we get:

1/5 + 2/15 = 2v<sub>s</sub>

This simplifies to: 5/15 = 1/3 = 2v<sub>s</sub>, so v<sub>s</sub> = 1/6 km/minute.

Substituting v<sub>s</sub> = 1/6 into equation 1:

1/5 = (1/6) + v<sub>c</sub>

Solving for v<sub>c</sub>:

v<sub>c</sub> = 1/5 - 1/6 = 1/30 km/minute


To express the speeds in km/hour, we multiply by 60:

v<sub>s</sub> = (1/6 km/minute) * 60 minutes/hour = 10 km/hour
v<sub>c</sub> = (1/30 km/minute) * 60 minutes/hour = 2 km/hour

Therefore, the speed of the sailor in still water is 10 km/hour, and the speed of the current is 2 km/hour.

Answer: {The speed of the sailor in still water is 10 km/hour and the speed of the current is 2 km/hour}

1429,"Points A and B are 70 km apart on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B at the same time. If they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours, but if they travel towards each other they meet in one hour. What are their respective speeds?","Let's denote the speed of the car starting from point A as 'x' km/hr and the speed of the car starting from point B as 'y' km/hr.

**Scenario 1: Traveling in the same direction**

When traveling in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds (x - y).  They meet in 7 hours, covering a distance of 70 km.  Therefore:

7(x - y) = 70

This simplifies to:

x - y = 10  (Equation 1)

**Scenario 2: Traveling towards each other**

When traveling towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds (x + y). They meet in 1 hour, covering a distance of 70 km. Therefore:

1(x + y) = 70

This simplifies to:

x + y = 70  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

Equation 1: x - y = 10
Equation 2: x + y = 70

We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:

2x = 80
x = 40

Substitute the value of x (40) into Equation 2:

40 + y = 70
y = 30

Therefore, the speed of the car starting from point A is 40 km/hr, and the speed of the car starting from point B is 30 km/hr.

Answer: {40 km/hr, 30 km/hr}

1430,"Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.","Let the speed of the train be 't' km/hour and the speed of the taxi be 'x' km/hour.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:**  The first journey took 5 hours and 30 minutes (5.5 hours).  The time spent on the train is 300/t and the time spent in the taxi is 200/x.  Therefore:

   300/t + 200/x = 5.5

* **Equation 2:** The second journey took 6 minutes longer, which is 5.5 + 6/60 = 5.6 hours. The time spent on the train is 260/t and the time spent in the taxi is 240/x. Therefore:

   260/t + 240/x = 5.6

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns.  We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.  Multiply the first equation by 26 and the second equation by 30 to make the coefficients of 1/x equal:


* Equation 1 * 26: 7800/t + 5200/x = 143
* Equation 2 * 30: 7800/t + 7200/x = 168

Subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation:

2000/x = 25

Solving for x:

x = 2000/25 = 80 km/hour (Taxi speed)

Now substitute the value of x (80 km/hr) back into either of the original equations to solve for t. Let's use Equation 1:

300/t + 200/80 = 5.5
300/t + 2.5 = 5.5
300/t = 3
t = 300/3 = 100 km/hour (Train speed)

Therefore, the speed of the train is 100 km/hour and the speed of the taxi is 80 km/hour.


Answer: {Train speed = 100 km/hr, Taxi speed = 80 km/hr}

1431,"A man travels 600 km partly by train and partly by car. If he covers 400 km by train and the rest by car, it takes him 6 hours and 30 minutes. But if he travels 200 km by train and rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and that of car.","Let the speed of the train be 't' km/hr and the speed of the car be 'c' km/hr.

**Scenario 1:**
* Distance by train = 400 km
* Distance by car = 600 - 400 = 200 km
* Time taken by train = 400/t hours
* Time taken by car = 200/c hours
* Total time = 400/t + 200/c = 6.5 hours  (6 hours 30 minutes)

**Scenario 2:**
* Distance by train = 200 km
* Distance by car = 600 - 200 = 400 km
* Time taken by train = 200/t hours
* Time taken by car = 400/c hours
* Total time = 200/t + 400/c = 7 hours (6.5 + 0.5 hours)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) 400/t + 200/c = 6.5
2) 200/t + 400/c = 7

We can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply equation (1) by 2:

3) 800/t + 400/c = 13

Now subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

(800/t + 400/c) - (200/t + 400/c) = 13 - 7
600/t = 6
t = 100 km/hr

Substitute t = 100 into equation (1):

400/100 + 200/c = 6.5
4 + 200/c = 6.5
200/c = 2.5
c = 80 km/hr

Therefore, the speed of the train is 100 km/hr and the speed of the car is 80 km/hr.

Answer: {Train speed: 100 km/hr, Car speed: 80 km/hr}

1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","Let the fixed charge be 'a' and the charge per kilometer be 'b'.
We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1 (10 km journey): a + 10b = 75
Equation 2 (15 km journey): a + 15b = 110

We can solve this system of equations. Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:

5b = 35
b = 7

Now, substitute the value of b (7) back into Equation 1:

a + 10(7) = 75
a + 70 = 75
a = 5

So the fixed charge is $5 and the charge per kilometer is $7.

For a 25 km journey, the total charge will be:

a + 25b = 5 + 25(7) = 5 + 175 = 180

Answer: {180}

1433,A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Let F be the full fare and R be the reservation charge.
The cost of one full reserved first class ticket is F + R = $216  (Equation 1)
The cost of one full and one half reserved first class tickets is F + R + (F/2) + R = 327 (Equation 2)
Simplifying Equation 2: (3/2)F + 2R = 327
Multiply Equation 1 by 2: 2F + 2R = 432
Subtract the simplified Equation 2 from the multiplied Equation 1:
(2F + 2R) - ((3/2)F + 2R) = 432 - 327
(1/2)F = 105
F = 210
Substitute F = 210 into Equation 1:
210 + R = 216
R = 6
Therefore, the basic first class full fare is $210 and the reservation charge is $6.

Answer: {210, 6}

1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let the original speed be 'x' km/hr and the distance be 'd' km.
Time taken at original speed = d/x hours.

If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his speed is (x + 1/2) km/hr.  Time taken = d/(x + 1/2) hours.
We are given that this time is 1 hour less than the original time, so:
d/x - d/(x + 1/2) = 1   (Equation 1)

If he walks 1 km/hr slower, his speed is (x - 1) km/hr. Time taken = d/(x - 1) hours.
We are given that this time is 3 hours more than the original time, so:
d/(x - 1) - d/x = 3   (Equation 2)

Now we solve these two equations simultaneously.  Let's simplify Equation 1:
d(x + 1/2) - dx = x(x + 1/2)
dx + d/2 - dx = x² + x/2
d/2 = x² + x/2
d = 2x² + x   (Equation 3)

Now simplify Equation 2:
dx - d(x - 1) = 3x(x - 1)
dx - dx + d = 3x² - 3x
d = 3x² - 3x   (Equation 4)

Since both Equation 3 and Equation 4 are equal to 'd', we can set them equal to each other:
2x² + x = 3x² - 3x
x² - 4x = 0
x(x - 4) = 0
This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = 0 or x = 4.  Since speed cannot be 0, the original speed is x = 4 km/hr.

Substitute x = 4 into Equation 3 (or Equation 4):
d = 2(4)² + 4 = 32 + 4 = 36 km

Therefore, the distance covered is 36 km and the original rate of walking is 4 km/hr.

Answer: {Distance: 36 km, Original speed: 4 km/hr}

1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"Let's denote:

* **x:** the time (in hours) the car traveled uphill.
* **y:** the time (in hours) the car traveled downhill.

We know the following:

* **Total time:** x + y = 15 hours
* **Total distance:** 30x + 50y = 650 km (distance = speed × time)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) x + y = 15
2) 30x + 50y = 650

We can solve this system.  Let's solve the first equation for x:

x = 15 - y

Now substitute this value of x into the second equation:

30(15 - y) + 50y = 650

450 - 30y + 50y = 650

20y = 200

y = 10

Now substitute y = 10 back into the equation x = 15 - y:

x = 15 - 10

x = 5

Therefore, the car traveled uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

Answer: {5, 10}

1436,"Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","Let the speed of the train be 't' km/hr and the speed of the bus be 'b' km/hr.

**Scenario 1:**

* Distance by train: 60 km
* Time by train: 60/t hours
* Distance by bus: 300 - 60 = 240 km
* Time by bus: 240/b hours
* Total time: 60/t + 240/b = 4 hours

**Scenario 2:**

* Distance by train: 100 km
* Time by train: 100/t hours
* Distance by bus: 300 - 100 = 200 km
* Time by bus: 200/b hours
* Total time: 100/t + 200/b = 4 hours + 10 minutes = 4 1/6 hours = 25/6 hours


We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) 60/t + 240/b = 4
2) 100/t + 200/b = 25/6

Let's solve this system of equations.  We can simplify equation (1) by dividing by 2:

3) 30/t + 120/b = 2

Now we can use elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. Multiply equation (3) by 10/3:

4) 100/t + 400/b = 20/3

Subtract equation (2) from equation (4):

(100/t + 400/b) - (100/t + 200/b) = (20/3) - (25/6)
200/b = 15/6 = 5/2
b = (200 * 2) / 5 = 80 km/hr

Substitute b = 80 into equation (3):

30/t + 120/80 = 2
30/t + 3/2 = 2
30/t = 1/2
t = 60 km/hr

Therefore, the speed of the train is 60 km/hr and the speed of the bus is 80 km/hr.

Answer: {Train speed: 60 km/hr, Bus speed: 80 km/hr}

1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","Let the original speed of the train be 'x' km/hr and the scheduled time be 't' hours.  The distance of the journey is constant and is equal to the product of speed and time (distance = speed × time).  Therefore, the distance is 'xt' km.

We can create two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** If the speed was 6 km/hr faster (x+6 km/hr), the time would be 8 hours less (t-8 hours).  So, the distance remains the same:  (x+6)(t-8) = xt

* **Equation 2:** If the speed was 6 km/hr slower (x-6 km/hr), the time would be 12 hours more (t+12 hours). So, the distance remains the same: (x-6)(t+12) = xt

Let's expand and simplify these equations:

Equation 1: xt - 8x + 6t - 48 = xt  => -8x + 6t = 48

Equation 2: xt + 12x - 6t - 72 = xt  => 12x - 6t = 72

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

-8x + 6t = 48
12x - 6t = 72

Adding the two equations eliminates 't':

4x = 120
x = 30 km/hr (original speed)

Substitute x = 30 into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for t:

-8(30) + 6t = 48
-240 + 6t = 48
6t = 288
t = 48 hours (scheduled time)

Now we can find the distance:

Distance = speed × time = 30 km/hr × 48 hours = 1440 km

1439,"The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.","Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

* Let 'x' be the cost of one bat.
* Let 'y' be the cost of one ball.

We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

* Equation 1: 7x + 6y = 3800  (from the first purchase)
* Equation 2: 3x + 5y = 1750  (from the second purchase)

We can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination.  Let's use elimination:

1. **Multiply Equation 2 by -2:** This will give us -6x - 10y = -3500

2. **Add the modified Equation 2 to Equation 1:** This eliminates the 'y' variable:
   (7x + 6y) + (-6x - 10y) = 3800 + (-3500)
   This simplifies to: x - 4y = 300

3. **Solve for x:**  From the simplified equation, we can express x in terms of y:
   x = 300 + 4y

4. **Substitute:** Substitute this expression for 'x' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 2:
   3(300 + 4y) + 5y = 1750
   900 + 12y + 5y = 1750
   17y = 850
   y = 50

5. **Solve for x:** Now that we know y = 50, substitute this value back into the expression for x:
   x = 300 + 4(50)
   x = 500

Therefore, the cost of each bat is $500 and the cost of each ball is $50.

Answer: {Bat: $500, Ball: $50}

We are given that the sum of the digits is 9, so we have:
a + b = 9  (Equation 1)

We are also given that nine times the number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits.  The reversed number is 10b + a.  Therefore:

9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a)  (Equation 2)

Expanding Equation 2, we get:

90a + 9b = 20b + 2a
88a = 11b
8a = b  (Equation 3)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

a + b = 9
8a = b

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:

a + 8a = 9
9a = 9
a = 1

Now substitute a = 1 back into Equation 3:

b = 8a = 8(1) = 8

How much amount did he invest at the two rates?","Let's denote the amount invested at 12% as 'x' and the amount invested at 10% as 'y'.  We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** Represents the total annual interest received: 0.12x + 0.10y = 130
* **Equation 2:** Represents the scenario where the investments are interchanged, resulting in $4 more interest: 0.10x + 0.12y = 134

Now we can solve this system of equations.  One way to do this is using the elimination method.  Let's multiply Equation 1 by -1.2 and Equation 2 by 1:

* **Equation 1 (modified):** -0.144x - 0.12y = -156
* **Equation 2:** 0.10x + 0.12y = 134

Now add the modified Equation 1 and Equation 2 together.  Notice that the 'y' terms cancel out:

-0.044x = -22

Solving for x:

x = -22 / -0.044 = 500

Now substitute the value of x (500) back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for y. Let's use Equation 1:

0.12(500) + 0.10y = 130
60 + 0.10y = 130
0.10y = 70
y = 700

F = 3S  (Equation 1)

After 12 years, the father's age will be F + 12 and the son's age will be S + 12.
From the second statement, we know that after 12 years, the father's age will be twice the age of his son:
F + 12 = 2(S + 12)  (Equation 2)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously.  Substitute Equation 1 (F = 3S) into Equation 2:
3S + 12 = 2(S + 12)
3S + 12 = 2S + 24
3S - 2S = 24 - 12
S = 12

Now that we know the son's present age (S), we can find the father's present age (F) using Equation 1:

The area of the rectangle is A = L * B square units.

According to the first condition, if the length is reduced by 5 units and the breadth is increased by 3 units, the area is reduced by 9 square units.  This can be expressed as:

(L - 5)(B + 3) = L * B - 9

Expanding this equation, we get:

LB + 3L - 5B - 15 = LB - 9
3L - 5B = 6   (Equation 1)


According to the second condition, if the length is increased by 3 units and the breadth is increased by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. This can be expressed as:

1461,"In a room containing 45 students there were twice as many girls as boys. How many of each, were there?","Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

* Let 'b' represent the number of boys.
* Let 'g' represent the number of girls.

We know two things:

1. **The total number of students:** b + g = 45
2. **The ratio of girls to boys:** g = 2b  (Twice as many girls as boys)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

b + 2b = 45

Combine like terms:

3b = 45

Solve for 'b':

b = 45 / 3 = 15

Now that we know there are 15 boys, we can find the number of girls using the second equation:

g = 2b = 2 * 15 = 30

Therefore, there are 15 boys and 30 girls.

Answer: {15 boys, 30 girls}

1462,An electrician cuts a 30 ft piece of wire into two pieces. One piece is 2 ft longer than the other. How long are the pieces?,"Let's say the length of the shorter piece of wire is 'x' feet.
The longer piece is 2 feet longer, so its length is 'x + 2' feet.
Together, the two pieces add up to the original 30 feet of wire.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 2) = 30

Combining like terms:

2x + 2 = 30

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

2x = 28

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 14

So the shorter piece is 14 feet long.  The longer piece is 14 + 2 = 16 feet long.

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"Let the two equal angles be x degrees each.
The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so it is (x - 12) degrees.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore:

x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Combining like terms:

3x - 12 = 180

Adding 12 to both sides:

3x = 192

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 64

So the two equal angles are 64 degrees each.
The third angle is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

1470,The third angle of a triangle is the same size as the first. The second angle is 4 times the third. Find the measure of the angles.,"Let the three angles of the triangle be A, B, and C.
We are given that the third angle (C) is the same size as the first (A).  So, A = C.
The second angle (B) is 4 times the third angle (C). So, B = 4C.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore:
A + B + C = 180

Since A = C, we can substitute A for C in the equation:
A + B + A = 180
2A + B = 180

We also know that B = 4C, and since A = C, we can substitute A for C in the equation for B:
B = 4A

Now substitute 4A for B in the equation 2A + B = 180:
2A + 4A = 180
6A = 180
A = 180 / 6
A = 30

Since A = C, then C = 30.
Since B = 4A, then B = 4 * 30 = 120.

Therefore, the angles are 30, 120, and 30 degrees.

Answer: {30, 120, 30}

1471,The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?,"Let's denote the three angles of the triangle as A, B, and C.
We are given that the second angle (B) is five times as large as the first angle (A).  So we can write this as:  B = 5A

We are also given that the third angle (C) is 12 degrees greater than the first angle (A).  This can be written as: C = A + 12

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore: A + B + C = 180

Now we can substitute the expressions for B and C from the first two equations into the third equation:

A + 5A + (A + 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

7A + 12 = 180

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7A = 168

Divide both sides by 7:

A = 24

Now that we know A = 24 degrees, we can find B and C:

B = 5A = 5 * 24 = 120 degrees

C = A + 12 = 24 + 12 = 36 degrees

Therefore, the three angles of the triangle are 24 degrees, 120 degrees, and 36 degrees.

Answer: {24, 120, 36}

1472,"The second angle of a triangle is three times the first, and the third is 12 degrees less than twice the first. Find the measures of the angles.","Let's denote the three angles of the triangle as A, B, and C.
We are given that:
* Angle B is three times Angle A:  B = 3A
* Angle C is 12 degrees less than twice Angle A: C = 2A - 12

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore:
A + B + C = 180

We can substitute the expressions for B and C from the given information into this equation:
A + 3A + (2A - 12) = 180

Now we can solve for A:
6A - 12 = 180
6A = 192
A = 32

Now that we know A, we can find B and C:
B = 3A = 3 * 32 = 96
C = 2A - 12 = 2 * 32 - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 32, 96, and 52 degrees.  We can check our work: 32 + 96 + 52 = 180.

We are given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 150 cm.  The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

2l + 2w = 150

We are also given that the length is 15 cm greater than the width.  This can be written as:

l = w + 15

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

2(w + 15) + 2w = 150

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

2w + 30 + 2w = 150
4w + 30 = 150
4w = 120
w = 30

We are also given that the length is 14 meters more than the width. This can be written as:

l = w + 14

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

2(w + 14) + 2w = 96

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

2w + 28 + 2w = 96
4w + 28 = 96
4w = 96 - 28
4w = 68
w = 17

Now that we know the width (w) is 17 meters, we can find the length (l) using the second equation:

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width (Area = length x width).  We know the area is 360 square centimeters and the length is 20 centimeters. Therefore, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length:

Width = Area / Length = 360 cm² / 20 cm = 18 cm

Now that we know the length (20 cm) and width (18 cm), we can calculate the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Perimeter = 2 * (20 cm + 18 cm) = 2 * 38 cm = 76 cm

1503,A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?,"The perimeter of the square is 4 * side length = 4 * 15 cm = 60 cm.
Since the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the perimeter of the square, the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).  We know the length is 18 cm, so we can solve for the width:
60 cm = 2 * (18 cm + width)
30 cm = 18 cm + width
width = 30 cm - 18 cm = 12 cm
The area of the rectangle is length * width = 18 cm * 12 cm = 216 cm².

1508,Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?,"The area of the square is 400 square inches.  Since the area of a square is side * side, the side length of the square is the square root of 400, which is 20 inches.

Because the circle touches each side of the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 20 inches, and its radius is 20/2 = 10 inches.

The area of a circle is given by the formula πr², where r is the radius.  So the area of the circle is π * (10 inches)² = 100π square inches.

Using π ≈ 3.14159, the area is approximately 314.159 square inches.

1553,"A store owner had six employees and bought five hundred eighty-three uniforms for them. If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?","To determine how many more uniforms the store owner needs to buy, we first need to find out how many uniforms each employee would receive if the uniforms were divided equally.  We divide the total number of uniforms by the number of employees: 583 uniforms / 6 employees = 97 uniforms with a remainder of 1.  This means each employee would get 97 uniforms, and there would be 1 uniform left over.

To ensure each employee receives the same number of uniforms with none left over, the store owner needs to buy enough uniforms so that the total number of uniforms is a multiple of 6.  Since the current total (583) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, the store owner needs to buy 5 more uniforms (6 - 1 = 5).  This will bring the total to 588 uniforms (583 + 5 = 588), which is evenly divisible by 6 (588 / 6 = 98).

If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?","First, we need to determine how many Starbursts Sean had left after giving some to his friends.  Since he gave equal numbers to 18 friends, we need to find a number that is divisible by 18.  We can find this by dividing 45 by 18; 45 divided by 18 is 2 with a remainder of 9.  This means he gave each friend 2 Starbursts (18 friends * 2 Starbursts/friend = 36 Starbursts).

Then, we need to calculate how many Starbursts he had left. Sean started with 45 Starbursts and gave away 36, leaving him with 45 - 36 = 9 Starbursts.

Finally, we need to determine how many Starbursts Sean ate. Since he ate what was left, he ate all 9 of the remaining Starbursts. Therefore, each person (including Sean) ate 2 Starbursts.

Since you can't buy half a case, Mary needs to buy 2 full cases. This will give her 2 cases * 6 boxes/case = 12 boxes.  Since she only sold 9, she will have 12 - 9 = 3 extra boxes.

Therefore, Mary needs 2 cases and 3 extra boxes.

2269,"Samuel had 14 Skittles. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Skittles remaining after sharing:** Samuel started with 14 Skittles and gave an equal number to 4 friends.  To find out how many he gave away, we divide the total by the number of friends (including himself): 14 Skittles / 5 people = 2.8 Skittles per person. Since you can't give away parts of Skittles, each friend received 2 Skittles (4 friends * 2 Skittles/friend = 8 Skittles total given away). This leaves Samuel with 14 - 8 = 6 Skittles.

2. **Skittles Samuel ate:** Samuel ate the remaining 6 Skittles.

3. **Skittles per person:** Each friend ate 2 Skittles, and Samuel ate 6 Skittles.  The question asks how many Skittles *each person* ate.  Therefore, we are only concerned with the number each friend ate.

Since you can't buy half a package, Betty must have bought 3 packages.  This means she started with 3 packages * 18 crackers/package = 54 crackers.  Then, we subtract the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers she started with: 54 crackers - 45 crackers = 9 crackers.  Therefore, Betty has 9 crackers left.

2274,"Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?","Answer: First, we need to determine how many Sweettarts Virginia had left after giving some to her friends. Since she gave equal numbers to 4 friends, the number of Sweettarts must be divisible by 4. We can find the remainder when 13 is divided by 4: 13 ÷ 4 = 3 with a remainder of 1. This means Virginia gave each friend 3 Sweettarts (13 - 1 = 12, and 12 ÷ 4 = 3).  She then ate the remaining 1 Sweettart. Therefore, each person (including Virginia) ate 3 Sweettarts.
