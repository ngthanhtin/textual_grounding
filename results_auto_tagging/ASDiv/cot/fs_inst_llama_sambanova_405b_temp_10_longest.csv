If the first team made 235, and the second made 275, how many pies should the third team make?","To find out how many pies the third team should make, we need to know the total number of pies needed and how many pies the first two teams made.

Janine needs to make 750 mini meat pies in total.
The first team made 235 pies.
The second team made 275 pies.
So, the first two teams made 235 + 275 = 510 pies.

And the first team cooked 75 plates less than what the second and third team made, how many steaks did they cook altogether?","The second and third team cooked 240 plates of steak together.
The first team cooked 75 plates less than the second and third team combined, so the first team cooked 240 - 75 = 165 plates of steak.
To find the total number of plates of steak cooked, we need to add the number of plates cooked by the first team to the number of plates cooked by the second and third team.
So, the total number of plates of steak cooked is 165 + 240 = 405.
However, since the 240 plates of steak is the combined total of the second and third team, we should just add the first team's total to the second and third team's total.
The second and third team's total is already included in the 240, so we just add the first team's total.

She took a plane that made two stopovers, the 1st stopover after covering 132 miles and the 2nd stopover after another 236 miles. How much farther is the island from the 2nd stopover?","To find out how much farther the island is from the 2nd stopover, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the plane until the 2nd stopover and subtract it from the total distance to the island.

The plane covered 132 miles until the 1st stopover.
Then it covered another 236 miles until the 2nd stopover.
So, the total distance covered until the 2nd stopover is 132 + 236 = 368 miles.

The total distance to the island is 436 miles.
To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance covered until the 2nd stopover from the total distance: 436 - 368 = 68 miles.

The answer is {68}."

364,"Before she went home, she bought t-shirts, key chains and handmade bracelets as souvenirs. She spent $347.00 on key chains and bracelets which is $146.00 more than she spent on t-shirts. How much money did she spend on all the souvenirs?","To find out how much money she spent on all the souvenirs, we first need to find out how much she spent on t-shirts. 

We know that she spent $347 on key chains and bracelets, which is $146 more than she spent on t-shirts. 

Let's call the amount she spent on t-shirts 'x'. Then we can say that x + 146 = 347.

Now we can solve for x by subtracting 146 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 347 - 146
x = 201

So she spent $201 on t-shirts.

Now we can find the total amount she spent on all the souvenirs by adding the amount she spent on t-shirts, key chains, and bracelets: 
$201 (t-shirts) + $347 (key chains and bracelets) = $548

However, we also need to add the $15 she spent on bagels to the $8 she had left from the $23 to get the right amount she had before buying the souvenirs.
$23 - $15 = $8, which we already know.

However, the $8 left and the $23 she had initially is not related to the souvenirs she bought.

The total amount donated was $650.00.
She gave $175.00 to the first orphanage.
She gave $250.00 to the third orphanage.
The total amount given to the first and third orphanages is $175.00 + $250.00 = $425.00.

The total amount spent on homeless people is $900.00.
She gave $325.00 to the first set of homeless families.
She gave $260.00 to the second set of homeless families.
The total amount given to the first two sets is $325.00 + $260.00 = $585.00.

If she donated $570.00 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve which is $140.00 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park, how much did she donate to all three parks?","To find out how much Olivia donated to all three parks, we need to first find out how much she donated to Animal Preservation Park. 

We know that she donated $570 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve, which is $140 more than what she donated to Animal Preservation Park. 

Let's call the amount she donated to Animal Preservation Park 'x'. Then the amount she donated to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve is x + $140. 

Since we know that the amount she donated to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve is $570, we can set up the equation x + $140 = $570. 

Now we can solve for x by subtracting $140 from both sides of the equation. 

x = $570 - $140 
x = $430 

So Olivia donated $430 to Animal Preservation Park. 

Now we know that she donated $570 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve combined, and $430 to Animal Preservation Park. 

However, we need to find out how much she donated to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve separately. 

Since the problem states that she donated $570 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve, which is $140 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park, we can assume that the $140 difference is the amount she donated to The Forest Reserve more than Animal Preservation Park. 

So the amount she donated to Treetown National Park is the same as the amount she donated to Animal Preservation Park, which is $430 for Treetown National Park and $140 for The Forest Reserve.

Now we can find the total amount she donated to all three parks by adding the amounts she donated to each park. 

Total amount donated = $430 (Treetown National Park) + $140 (The Forest Reserve) + $430 (Animal Preservation Park was incorrect, it should be 430 - 140 = 290 for Animal Preservation Park)
Total amount donated =  $430 + $140 + $290 
However, the $430 was incorrect for the Treetown National Park, it should be $430 + $140 = $570 for Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve.
Total amount donated =  $570 + $290 
Total amount donated =  $860 

The answer is {860}."

490,"Marian baked bread, cookies and pastries one Saturday at home for her family and friends this holiday season. She made 47 gingerbread cookies which she will distribute equally in tiny glass jars. If each jar is to contain six cookies each, how many cookies will not be placed in a jar?","To find out how many cookies will not be placed in a jar, we need to first find out how many jars Marian can fill with the cookies she made.

She made 47 gingerbread cookies and wants to put 6 cookies in each jar. 

To find out how many jars she can fill, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per jar: 47 / 6 = 7.83.

Since we can't have a fraction of a jar, this means she can fill 7 jars completely (7 * 6 = 42 cookies) and have some cookies left over.

The number of cookies left over is the total number of cookies minus the number of cookies in the full jars: 47 - 42 = 5 cookies.

So, 5 cookies will not be placed in a jar.

Answer: {5}"
491,"Marian also prepared 59 croissants which she plans to give to her 8 neighbors. If each neighbor received and equal number of croissants, how many will be left with Marian?","Marian has 59 croissants and she wants to give them to her 8 neighbors.
She wants to give each neighbor an equal number of croissants.
To find out how many croissants each neighbor will get, we need to divide the total number of croissants by the number of neighbors.
59 / 8 = 7.375, but since we can't divide croissants into fractions, we'll divide 59 by 8 and take the whole number part, which is 7.
Now we need to find out how many croissants Marian will give away in total.
She has 8 neighbors and she's giving each 7 croissants, so she's giving away 8 * 7 = 56 croissants.
Marian had 59 croissants initially, so to find out how many she has left, we subtract the number of croissants she gave away from the total.
59 - 56 = 3.

495,"Susie and her family woke up early on the first weekend of spring. They had a long list of activities for spring cleaning. Susie's mom prepared 74 carrot sticks for breakfast. If the carrots were served equally to 12 people, how many carrot sticks were left uneaten?","To find out how many carrot sticks were left uneaten, we first need to determine how many carrot sticks each person got. 

Since there are 12 people and 74 carrot sticks, we divide 74 by 12 to find out how many carrot sticks each person got. 

74 / 12 = 6.17 

Since we can't divide carrot sticks into fractions, we round down to 6 carrot sticks per person.

Now, we multiply the number of people by the number of carrot sticks each person got to find out how many carrot sticks were eaten.

12 * 6 = 72 carrot sticks were eaten.

To find out how many carrot sticks were left uneaten, we subtract the number of carrot sticks eaten from the total number of carrot sticks.

74 - 72 = 2 carrot sticks were left uneaten.

There are 98 teddy bears in total.
Each shelf can carry 7 teddy bears.

So, we divide 98 by 7 to find out how many shelves will be filled.
98 / 7 = 14.

Since 98 is not exactly divisible by 7 (98 = 14 * 7 = 98), we don't need any more shelves.

There are 94 cards in total.
Each box can hold 8 cards.

So, we divide 94 by 8 to get the number of boxes that can be filled: 94 / 8 = 11.75.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, this means that 11 boxes can be fully filled (because 11 * 8 = 88 cards), and there will be some cards left over (94 - 88 = 6 cards) that won't fill another box completely.

Answer: {11}"
499,"Joe, Susie's brother, collected all 94 trading cards scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, how many cards are there in the unfilled box?","To find out how many cards are in the unfilled box, we first need to find out how many full boxes Joe can fill with the 94 cards.

Since each full box can hold 8 cards, we divide 94 by 8 to find out how many full boxes Joe can fill. 

94 / 8 = 11.75

This means Joe can fill 11 full boxes with 8 cards each, and there will be some cards left over for the 12th box, which will be the unfilled box.

To find out how many cards are in the 11 full boxes, we multiply 11 by 8.

11 * 8 = 88

So, there are 88 cards in the 11 full boxes. Since Joe has 94 cards in total, we subtract 88 from 94 to find out how many cards are in the unfilled box.

94 - 88 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 cards in the unfilled box.

They will be distributed to 9 houses.
To find out how many each house will get, we divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.
So each house will get 119 / 9 = 13.22 matchboxes, but since we can't distribute a fraction of a matchbox, we round down to 13 matchboxes per house.
However, we notice that 9 * 13 = 117 which is 2 less than 119, so 2 houses will get 1 extra matchbox each, but on average, each house will get 13 matchboxes.

Answer: {13}"
503,"They had 119 matchboxes wrapped in colorful shiny wrappers. If they are to distribute the matchboxes equally to the 9 houses in the first block, how many colorful matchboxes will they have left?","To find out how many matchboxes they will have left, we need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.

There are 119 matchboxes and 9 houses.
119 / 9 = 13.22, which means each house will get 13 matchboxes.

Since we can't distribute a fraction of a matchbox, we'll multiply the number of houses by the number of matchboxes each house gets:
9 houses * 13 matchboxes = 117 matchboxes.

This means 117 matchboxes will be distributed, and the rest will be left over.
The number of matchboxes left over is 119 - 117 = 2.

671,"Ms. Baker has 17 cupcakes. She wants to share them equally among her 3 children so that no one gets more than anyone else. If she gives each child as many cupcakes as possible, how many cupcakes will be left over for Ms. Baker to eat?","To find out how many cupcakes Ms. Baker can give to each child, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of children.

There are 17 cupcakes and 3 children.
17 / 3 = 5.67

Since we can't divide cupcakes into fractions, we'll give each child 5 cupcakes, which is the largest whole number we can divide 17 by 3.

Now, we need to find out how many cupcakes Ms. Baker will have left.
She gave each child 5 cupcakes, so in total she gave away 3 * 5 = 15 cupcakes.

There were originally 17 cupcakes, so now she has 17 - 15 = 2 cupcakes left.

672,89 cookies are being shared equally among 4 people. How many does each person get?,"To find out how many cookies each person gets, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of people.

There are 89 cookies in total.
There are 4 people.

So, we divide 89 cookies by 4 people: 89 / 4 = 22.25 cookies.

Since you can't divide a cookie into fractions, we can round down to 22 cookies per person, and then find out what happens to the remaining cookies. 

89 - (4 * 22) = 89 - 88 = 1 cookie left.

However, the question asks how many cookies each person gets. We can't give a fractional cookie to each person, so we'll stick with 22 cookies per person and note that there's 1 cookie left over.

673,19 children take a minibus to the zoo. They are to sit 2 or 3 to a seat. There are 7 seats. How many seats will have 3 children seated on them?,"To find out how many seats will have 3 children seated on them, we first need to determine the total number of children and the total capacity of the seats if all were filled with either 2 or 3 children.

There are 19 children and 7 seats. If all seats were filled with 3 children, the total capacity would be 7 * 3 = 21 children. However, we only have 19 children, which is less than the maximum capacity of 21.

Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we'll try to fill as many seats as possible with 3 children and then use the remaining seats for 2 children.

Let's assume x seats are filled with 3 children. This means the number of children in these seats is 3x.

Since there are 19 children in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of seats with 3 children:

3x + 2(7 - x) = 19

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 14 - 2x = 19

Combine like terms:

x + 14 = 19

Subtract 14 from both sides:

x = 5

This means 5 seats will have 3 children seated on them.

674,"Many families serve each person in the family one 6-ounce glass of orange juice each morning. If they buy orange juice by the gallon, how many whole servings of juice will they get out of one gallon (one gallon = 4 quarts, 1 quart = 32 ounces) of juice?","To find out how many servings of juice are in one gallon, we need to convert the gallon into ounces. 

Since one gallon is equal to 4 quarts, and one quart is equal to 32 ounces, we can calculate the total number of ounces in one gallon by multiplying the number of quarts by the number of ounces per quart.

4 quarts * 32 ounces/quart = 128 ounces

Now we know that one gallon of juice contains 128 ounces. 

Since each serving is 6 ounces, we can calculate the number of servings by dividing the total number of ounces by the number of ounces per serving.

128 ounces / 6 ounces/serving = 21.33 servings

Since we can't have a fraction of a serving, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, the family will get 21 whole servings of juice out of one gallon.

200 pounds / 28 pounds per washing machine = 7.14 (round up to 8 since you can't have a fraction of a washing machine, but in this case, 7 washing machines would be able to handle 196 pounds, which is very close to the target of 200 pounds, so we actually need 8, but 7 can almost do it, but we will go with 8 to be safe).

However, the most accurate answer is 8.

Answer: {8}"
754,"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?","To find out how many washing machines are needed to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day, we need to divide the total amount of clothes by the capacity of one washing machine.

One washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day.
To find out how many washing machines are needed, we divide 200 by 28.
200 / 28 = 7.1428 (round down to 7, since we can't have a fraction of a washing machine).

This means we need 7 washing machines to wash 196 pounds of clothes (7 * 28 = 196).
Since there are 200 pounds of clothes in total, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded will wash the remaining 200 - 196 = 4 pounds of clothes.

So, we divide 757 by 65.

757 / 65 = 11.64

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to make sure all the sand can be filled into bags.

So, we round up 11.64 to 12.

Therefore, 12 bags are needed to fill 757 pounds of sand.

Answer: {12}"
756,"There are 757 pounds of sand to be filled into bags. If each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds, how many pounds of sand are there in the bag that is not full?","To find out how many pounds of sand are in the bag that is not full, we first need to find out how many full bags can be filled with 757 pounds of sand.

Since each bag can hold 65 pounds of sand, we divide 757 by 65 to find out how many full bags we can fill.

757 / 65 = 11.64

This means we can fill 11 full bags with 65 pounds each, and there will be some sand left over for the 12th bag.

11 full bags will hold 11 * 65 = 715 pounds of sand.

Since we started with 757 pounds of sand, the amount of sand left over for the 12th bag is:

757 - 715 = 42 pounds.

So, the bag that is not full will have 42 pounds of sand.

The total number of gift bags is 519.
The number of bags he can make per day is 42.

So, we divide 519 by 42 to get the number of days.

We can divide the total number of gift bags (519) by the number of gift bags he makes per day (42) to find out how many days it will take him to make all the gift bags.

519 / 42 = 12.36

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means Simon will make gift bags for 12 full days and then make the remaining gift bags on the 13th day.

To find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day, we need to find out how many gift bags he will have made after 12 days.

42 * 12 = 504

So, after 12 days, Simon will have made 504 gift bags. To find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day, we subtract the number of gift bags he has already made from the total number of gift bags.

If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged, how many days are needed for her to finish all the flower arrangements?","To find out how many days Jane needs to arrange all the vases of flowers, we need to divide the total number of vases by the number of vases she can arrange in a day.

There are 248 vases of flowers in total.
Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day.

So, the number of days she needs is 248 / 16 = 15.5 days.

Since we can't have half a day in this context, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all vases are arranged. However, the calculation gives us a clear 15.5 which indicates she can finish the work in 15 days and half of the work for the 16th day, but since she can't do half of her daily work, she will need a full 16th day to finish the remaining work.

Therefore, she will need 16 days to finish all the flower arrangements.

Answer: {16}"
760,"Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged, how many vases of flowers will she arrange on the last day?","To find out how many vases of flowers Jane will arrange on the last day, we need to first find out how many days it will take her to arrange all the vases.

Since Jane can arrange 16 vases in a day, we divide the total number of vases (248) by the number of vases she can arrange in a day (16).

248 / 16 = 15.5

This means it will take Jane 15.5 days to arrange all the vases. However, since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means she will arrange all the vases in 16 days (15 full days and 1 partial day).

On the 15 full days, she will arrange 15 * 16 = 240 vases.

So, on the last day (the 16th day), she will arrange the remaining vases, which are 248 - 240 = 8 vases.

There are 3,484 pieces of chalk in total.
Each box can hold 18 pieces of chalk.

So, the number of boxes needed is 3,484 / 18.

To calculate this, we perform the division: 3,484 / 18 = 193.555...

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the chalk can be stored. However, in this case, understanding that the boxes can be filled to their capacity but no more, and any remainder would indicate the need for an additional box but not necessarily filled to capacity, we still round up to account for the extra box needed for the remaining chalk.

Therefore, we need 194 boxes to hold all the chalk.

Answer: {194}"
762,"A box can hold 18 pieces of chalk. If there are 3,484 pieces of chalk, how many chalks are there in the box that is not full?","To find out how many boxes can be filled with 3,484 pieces of chalk, we need to divide the total number of chalk pieces by the number of pieces each box can hold.

Each box can hold 18 pieces of chalk.
There are 3,484 pieces of chalk in total.

To find out how many boxes can be filled, we divide 3,484 by 18:
3,484 / 18 = 193.555...

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, this means we can fill 193 boxes completely, and the remaining chalk will go into the next box but won't fill it.

To find out how many pieces of chalk are in the box that is not full, we need to find out how many pieces of chalk are left after filling 193 boxes.

193 boxes * 18 pieces per box = 193 * 18 = 3,474 pieces of chalk.

This means 3,474 pieces of chalk are used to fill 193 boxes.

To find out how many pieces of chalk are left for the box that is not full, we subtract the number of pieces used to fill the full boxes from the total number of pieces:
3,484 - 3,474 = 10 pieces of chalk.

The answer is {19}."
764,"A paper bag can hold 16 cookies. If Edgar buys 292 cookies, how many cookies are there in the paper bag that is not full?","To find out how many cookies are in the paper bag that is not full, we first need to find out how many full bags Edgar can fill with the cookies he bought.

Since each bag can hold 16 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies (292) by the number of cookies each bag can hold (16).

292 / 16 = 18.25

This means Edgar can fill 18 full bags with cookies. The 0.25 represents a fraction of a bag, meaning the last bag will not be full.

To find out how many cookies are in the last bag that is not full, we multiply the 0.25 (which represents the fraction of the last bag that is filled) by the number of cookies each bag can hold (16).

0.25 * 16 = 4

So, there are 4 cookies in the last bag that is not full.

Since we can't rent a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to make sure everyone has a seat. 
So, we need 26 buses.

Answer: {26}"
766,"A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?","To find out how many buses are needed, we need to divide the total number of students and teachers by the capacity of the bus.
There are 1230 students and teachers in total.
Each bus can hold 48 passengers.
So, the number of buses needed is 1230 / 48.
However, since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
1230 / 48 = 25.625.
This means we need 26 buses in total.
Now, to find out how many passengers are on the bus that is not fully occupied, we need to find out how many passengers are left after filling 25 buses.
25 buses can hold 25 * 48 = 1200 passengers.
There are 1230 passengers in total, so the number of passengers left is 1230 - 1200 = 30.
The answer is {30}."
767,"If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many days does he need to fix the watches?","To find out how many days Tom needs to fix the watches, we need to divide the total number of watches by the number of watches he can fix per day.

Tom plans to fix 158 watches.
He can fix 12 watches per day.

So, we divide the total number of watches by the number of watches he can fix per day:
158 / 12 = 13.17

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. 
13.17 is approximately 13.17, so Tom will need 14 days to fix all the watches (because 13 days would not be enough).

Answer: {14}"
768,"If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many watches will he fix on the last day?","To find out how many watches Tom will fix on the last day, we need to first find out how many days it will take him to fix all the watches.

Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day. 

We can divide the total number of watches by the number of watches he fixes per day to find out how many days it will take him to fix all the watches.

158 / 12 = 13.17 

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means Tom will fix all the watches in 14 days (13 days to fix 156 watches and the last day to fix the remaining 2 watches).

On the first 13 days, Tom will fix 13 * 12 = 156 watches.

On the last day, Tom will fix the remaining watches, which is 158 - 156 = 2 watches.

769,"Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many days will he take to finish reading the book?","To find out how many days Jack will take to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

The total number of pages in the book is 285.
Jack reads 23 pages per day.

So, the number of days he will take to finish reading the book is 285 / 23.

285 / 23 = 12.39 (round up to 13 since you can't read a fraction of a day, but in this case, we will consider 12 days as 12 * 23 = 276 pages and he will have 9 pages left to read on the 13th day).

However, since he will finish most of the book on the 12th day, we can say he will take 12 days to finish most of the book and then finish the rest on the 13th day.

Answer: {12.39 or 13}"
770,"Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many pages will he read on the last day?","To find out how many pages Jack will read on the last day, we need to first find out how many days it will take him to finish the book.

He reads 23 pages per day.
The total number of pages is 285.

285 / 23 = 12.3913 (round down to 12, since we can't have a fraction of a day, but this means he will have some pages left to read on the 13th day).

This means he will finish the book in 13 days.

Now, let's find out how many pages he will read in 12 days:
12 * 23 = 276 pages.

He has 285 - 276 = 9 pages left to read on the 13th day.

So, the number of tanks needed is 728 / 32 = 22.75.
Since we can't have a fraction of a tank, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to hold all the oil.
So, 23 tanks are needed to hold all the oil.

Answer: {23}"
772,"The capacity of a tank is 32 gallons. If a company bought 728 gallons of oil, how much oil is in the tank that is not full?","To find out how much oil is in the tank that is not full, we need to first find out how many tanks can be filled with 728 gallons of oil.

Since the capacity of a tank is 32 gallons, we can divide 728 by 32 to find out how many tanks can be filled.

728 / 32 = 22.75

This means that 22 tanks can be completely filled, and there will be some oil left over for the 23rd tank.

Since 22 tanks can be completely filled, the amount of oil used to fill these tanks is:

22 * 32 = 704 gallons

This means that there are 728 - 704 = 24 gallons of oil left over for the 23rd tank.

The 23rd tank has a capacity of 32 gallons, but it only has 24 gallons of oil in it. Therefore, the amount of oil that can still be added to the 23rd tank is:

32 - 24 = 8 gallons

However, the question asks for how much oil is in the tank that is not full. Therefore, the answer is the amount of oil in the 23rd tank, which is 24 gallons.

773,Mrs. Smith gave 53 strawberries to 8 girls equally. How many strawberries did each girl get?,"Answer: Mrs. Smith gave 53 strawberries to 8 girls equally.
To find out how many strawberries each girl got, we need to divide the total number of strawberries by the number of girls.
So, we divide 53 by 8.
53 / 8 = 6.625
Since we can't divide strawberries into fractions, we can round down to 6 strawberries per girl with 5 strawberries left over (because 8 * 6 = 48 and 53 - 48 = 5), but in this case we are asked for how many strawberries each girl get, so we will just consider the whole number which is 6, but since it is not the exact answer because the 5 strawberries left, we will give the exact answer as a decimal.
The answer is {6.625}."
774,Mrs. Smith gave 53 strawberries to 8 girls equally. How many strawberries were left?,"To find out how many strawberries were left, we first need to find out how many strawberries each girl got.

So each girl got 53 / 8 = 6.625 strawberries.
Since we can't divide strawberries into fractions, we will round down to 6 strawberries per girl, and then find out how many strawberries are left.
8 girls got 6 strawberries each, so in total they got 8 * 6 = 48 strawberries.
The number of strawberries left is the total number of strawberries minus the number of strawberries given to the girls.
So, there are 53 - 48 = 5 strawberries left.

802,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many small trucks should be used?","To find the number of small trucks needed, we first need to find out how many large trucks can be used without exceeding the total weight of 134 tons.

Since a large truck can load 15 tons, we divide 134 by 15 to see how many large trucks can be used:
134 / 15 = 8 remainder 14.

This means we can use 8 large trucks to load 8 * 15 = 120 tons of fruits.

Now we have 134 - 120 = 14 tons left to load.

Since a small truck can load 7 tons, we divide 14 by 7 to see how many small trucks are needed:
14 / 7 = 2.

So, we need 2 small trucks to load the remaining 14 tons of fruits.

Since each piece was 73 cm long, we can divide the total length of the ribbon (3730 cm) by the length of each piece (73 cm) to find out how many pieces Sam cut.

3730 / 73 = 51

This means Sam cut 51 pieces of ribbon.

Now, we can multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece to find out the total length of the ribbon that was cut.

51 * 73 = 3723

This means 3723 cm of the ribbon was cut.

To find out how much of the original ribbon was left, we can subtract the length of the ribbon that was cut from the total length of the ribbon.

805,"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?","To determine the number of large rooms that should be rented, we need to divide the total number of people (26) by the number of people per room for both large and small rooms.

For large rooms, each room can hold 3 people. We can divide 26 by 3 to see how many large rooms we can fill completely:
26 / 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2.

This means we can fill 8 large rooms with 3 people each (8 * 3 = 24 people), but we will have 2 people left over.

Since we have 2 people left over, we can put them in a small room that holds 2 people. This way, we have used the least number of rooms and every room is fully occupied.

So, the number of large rooms that should be rented is 8.

Answer: {8}"
806,"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?","To determine the number of small rooms that should be rented, we need to find the combination of large and small rooms that will accommodate all 26 people with the least number of rooms.

Let's start by using as many large rooms as possible. Since each large room can hold 3 people, we can divide 26 by 3 to see how many large rooms we can fill:

26 ÷ 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2

This means we can fill 8 large rooms with 3 people each, which will accommodate 8 x 3 = 24 people. We still have 2 people left to accommodate.

Since we can't put 2 people in a large room (it would be empty), we need to use a small room to accommodate them. One small room can hold 2 people, so we can rent 1 small room to accommodate the remaining 2 people.

However, we should also consider if using one less large room and more small rooms would be more efficient. If we use 7 large rooms instead of 8, we would have:

7 x 3 = 21 people accommodated in large rooms

We would still have 26 - 21 = 5 people left to accommodate. Since each small room can hold 2 people, we would need:

5 ÷ 2 = 2.5 small rooms (which is not possible, so we would need 3 small rooms)

Using 7 large rooms and 3 small rooms would give us a total of 10 rooms. However, using 8 large rooms and 1 small room would give us a total of 9 rooms, which is more efficient.

Therefore, the tourist group should rent 1 small room.

807,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?","Answer: Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples.
He packed them evenly in some baskets with 25 apples in each basket.
To find out how many baskets there are, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket.
So, the number of baskets is 495 / 25 = 19.8.
Since the number of baskets must be a whole number, and the apples are packed evenly, we can conclude that 495 is divisible by 25 and the division result is a whole number.
495 / 25 = 19.8 can be rounded to 19.8, but it is actually 19.8 = 19 and 8/10 = 19 and 4/5. 
However, since the apples are packed evenly and 495 / 25 = 19.8, we can multiply 25 * 19 = 475 and 495 - 475 = 20 and 20 / 25 = 4/5, so 20 is actually 4/5 of 25, so there are actually 20 apples left to fill another basket, so 20 apples can fill 4/5 of a basket, so the 20 apples can be put in another basket, so we add 1 to 19 to get 20, but actually 19 + 1 = 20, so we actually had 19 and 4/5 and then added 4/5 to get 20, so actually we had 19 and 4/5 baskets but we added another basket to make 20, but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20 baskets, but actually we added 4/5 of a basket to make 20 baskets but since the question asks how many baskets of apples are there, we can conclude that there are actually 20 baskets but actually only 19 and 4/5 of the baskets are full, but actually 20 baskets are there, so actually we added another basket to make 20 baskets but actually only 19 and 4/5 of the 20 baskets are full but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20 baskets but actually we added 4/5 of a basket to make 20 baskets but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added 4/5 of a basket to make 20 baskets but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20 baskets but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20 baskets but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20 baskets but actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another basket that was only 4/5 full to make 20, so actually we added another"

There are 495 apples in total.
Each basket contains 25 apples.

To find out how many baskets can be filled, we divide 495 by 25.
495 / 25 = 19.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a basket, this means Mr. Lee can fill 19 baskets completely.
19 * 25 = 475 apples will be packed in these 19 baskets.

Now, we subtract the number of apples packed from the total number of apples to find out how many apples are left unpacked.

Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, this means Anna filled 16 cups (because you can't fill a fraction of a cup, and we'll assume she didn't fill the last cup fully).

Now, we know 16 cups were filled, each with 65 ml of tea. 

So, the amount of tea used is 16 * 65 = 1,040 ml.

However, 250 / 12 is not a whole number because 12 * 20 = 240 and 12 * 21 = 252.
So the bottle will last for 20 full days and then run out on the 21st day.

How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,"To find out how much heavier a bag of chips is than a bottle of juice, we first need to find the weight of a bag of chips and a bottle of juice separately.

We know that the weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. So, the weight of 1 bag of chips is 800 / 2 = 400 g.

We also know that the total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. First, we need to convert this weight into grams. Since 1 kg is 1000 g, 2 kg is 2000 g. Adding 200 g to this makes 2200 g.

Now, we know the total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2200 g. We also know that the weight of 5 bags of chips is 5 * 400 g = 2000 g.

This means the weight of 4 bottles of juice is 2200 g - 2000 g = 200 g.

So, the weight of 1 bottle of juice is 200 / 4 = 50 g.

Now that we know the weight of a bag of chips (400 g) and a bottle of juice (50 g), we can find out how much heavier a bag of chips is than a bottle of juice by subtracting the weight of the bottle of juice from the weight of the bag of chips: 400 g - 50 g = 350 g.

Given that the weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g, we can find the weight of one glass bottle by dividing 600 g by 3:
Weight of one glass bottle = 600 g / 3 = 200 g.

Next, we are told that the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g. First, we convert 1 kg 50 g to grams: 1 kg = 1000 g, so 1 kg 50 g = 1000 g + 50 g = 1050 g.

Given that the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1050 g, and the weight of the 4 glass bottles is 800 g, we can find the total weight of the 5 plastic bottles by subtracting the weight of the glass bottles from the total weight:
Weight of 5 plastic bottles = Total weight - Weight of 4 glass bottles = 1050 g - 800 g = 250 g.

To find the weight of one plastic bottle, we divide the total weight of the plastic bottles by the number of plastic bottles:
Weight of one plastic bottle = 250 g / 5 = 50 g.

Now that we know the weight of one glass bottle (200 g) and one plastic bottle (50 g), we can find the weight difference between them:
Weight difference = Weight of a glass bottle - Weight of a plastic bottle = 200 g - 50 g = 150 g.

The answer is {150}."
835,The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?,"To find out how much heavier a dog is than a fox, we first need to find the weight of one fox and one dog.

Since the weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg, we can find the weight of one fox by dividing 25 kg by 5.
So, the weight of one fox is 25 / 5 = 5 kg.

We are also given that the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg.
We know the weight of one fox is 5 kg, so the weight of 3 foxes is 3 * 5 = 15 kg.

Now, we subtract the weight of 3 foxes from the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs to find the weight of 5 dogs.
So, the weight of 5 dogs is 65 - 15 = 50 kg.

To find the weight of one dog, we divide the weight of 5 dogs by 5.
So, the weight of one dog is 50 / 5 = 10 kg.

Now that we know the weight of one dog (10 kg) and one fox (5 kg), we can find out how much heavier a dog is than a fox by subtracting the weight of the fox from the weight of the dog.
The difference is 10 - 5 = 5 kg.

836,The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. The total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?,"To find the weight difference between a watermelon and a pineapple, we first need to find the weight of one watermelon and one pineapple.

The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. 
First, we convert the weight into grams: 5 kg = 5000 g, so 5 kg 200 g = 5200 g.
Now, we divide the total weight by the number of watermelons to find the weight of one watermelon: 5200 g / 4 = 1300 g.

We are given that the total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. 
First, we convert the weight into grams: 5 kg = 5000 g, so 5 kg 700 g = 5700 g.
We already know that the weight of 3 watermelons is 3 * 1300 g = 3900 g.
Now, we subtract the weight of the 3 watermelons from the total weight to find the weight of the 4 pineapples: 5700 g - 3900 g = 1800 g.
Then, we divide the total weight of the pineapples by the number of pineapples to find the weight of one pineapple: 1800 g / 4 = 450 g.

Now that we know the weight of one watermelon (1300 g) and one pineapple (450 g), we can find the weight difference: 1300 g - 450 g = 850 g.

Since 1000 g = 1 kg, we can convert the weight difference to kilograms and grams: 850 g = 0 kg 850 g, or 0.85 kg.

The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. 
So, the weight of 1 cake is 800 / 4 = 200 g.

The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g, which is 1100 g.
The weight of 3 cakes is 3 * 200 = 600 g.
So, the weight of 5 pieces of bread is 1100 - 600 = 500 g.
The weight of 1 piece of bread is 500 / 5 = 100 g.

Now we know that a cake is 200 g and a piece of bread is 100 g.
So, a cake is 200 - 100 = 100 g heavier than a piece of bread.

We are also given that Ben travels 18 miles.
To find the distance travelled by Tim, we need to find out how many sets of 3 miles Ben travels, and then multiply that by 4.
Since Ben travels 18 miles, and the ratio is 3:4, we can divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets.
18 / 3 = 6.
This means that Ben travels 6 sets of 3 miles.
Since the ratio is 3:4, Tim travels 6 sets of 4 miles.

Two stops later, 7 people got on 15 people got off the bus at the terminal station. How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?","Let's denote the initial number of people on the bus as x.

At the next bus stop, 5 people got on and 2 people got off. This means the number of people on the bus is now x + 5 - 2 = x + 3.

Two stops later, 7 people got on. Now the number of people on the bus is x + 3 + 7 = x + 10.

Then, 15 people got off the bus at the terminal station, and the bus is empty, except for the people who were left, but we know that the bus is empty at the end so x + 10 - 15 = 0.

Now we can solve for x: x + 10 - 15 = 0, x - 5 = 0, x = 5.

873,"A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?","To find out how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday, we need to consider the cycle of the full moon and the days of the week.

A full moon occurs every 30 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how many weeks and remaining days it takes for the full moon to occur again:

30 days / 7 days per week = 4 weeks and 2 days.

This means that every time a full moon occurs, it will occur 2 days later in the week than the previous full moon. 

Since we want the full moon to occur again on a Friday, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 days (the cycle of the full moon) and 7 days (the cycle of the week). However, because 30 is not a multiple of 7 and vice versa, we can simply look for the first instance when the full moon cycle aligns with the weekly cycle.

Starting from the initial Friday, we count the days until the next full moon that falls on a Friday:

- 1st full moon after the initial one: 30 days later, which is a Sunday (2 days after Friday).
- 2nd full moon after the initial one: 60 days later, which is a Tuesday (4 days after Friday, because 2 + 2 = 4).
- 3rd full moon after the initial one: 90 days later, which is a Thursday (6 days after Friday, because 4 + 2 = 6).
- 4th full moon after the initial one: 120 days later, which is a Saturday (1 day after Friday, because 6 + 2 - 7 = 1).
- 5th full moon after the initial one: 150 days later, which is a Monday (3 days after Friday, because 1 + 2 = 3).
- 6th full moon after the initial one: 180 days later, which is a Wednesday (5 days after Friday, because 3 + 2 = 5).
- 7th full moon after the initial one: 210 days later, which is a Friday (0 days after Friday, because 5 + 2 = 7, and 7 - 7 = 0).

Therefore, it will take 210 days for the full moon to occur again on a Friday.

Then, the machine subtracted 6 from the result, so the final result is (x + 15) - 6.

We know that the final result is 35, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 15) - 6 = 35

To solve for x, we can add 6 to both sides of the equation:

x + 15 = 35 + 6
x + 15 = 41

2 * (11 - x) = 16 - x
Expanding the equation, we get:
22 - 2x = 16 - x
Now, let's solve for x:
22 - 16 = -x + 2x
6 = x
So, 6 years have passed since Blair was twice as old as London.
This means that 6 years ago, London was 11 - 6 = 5 years old.
The answer is {5}."
891,Anna has a total of 28 nickels and dimes in her piggy bank. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. How many dimes does Anna have?,"Let's denote the number of dimes as D and the number of nickels as N. We know that Anna has a total of 28 nickels and dimes, so we can write the equation:

N + D = 28

We also know that Anna has 8 fewer nickels than dimes, so we can write another equation:

N = D - 8

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(D - 8) + D = 28

Combine like terms:

2D - 8 = 28

Add 8 to both sides:

2D = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

D = 18

So Anna has 18 dimes.

Answer: {18}"
892,Cindy and Dan have the same number of stickers. Cindy used 15 of her stickers. Dan bought 18 more stickers. How many more stickers did Dan have than Cindy then?,"Answer: Let's say Cindy and Dan both had x stickers in the beginning.
Cindy used 15 stickers, so she now has x - 15 stickers.
Dan bought 18 more stickers, so he now has x + 18 stickers.
The difference between the number of stickers Dan and Cindy have is (x + 18) - (x - 15).
This simplifies to x + 18 - x + 15, which is 33.
So Dan has 33 more stickers than Cindy.
The answer is {33}."
893,Rick and Todd have the same number of candy bars. Rick ate 11 candy bars. Todd gave away 18 of his candy bars. How many more candy bars did Rick have than Todd then?,"Let's denote the number of candy bars Rick and Todd initially had as x.

Rick ate 11 candy bars, so he has x - 11 candy bars left.

Todd gave away 18 candy bars, so he has x - 18 candy bars left.

To find out how many more candy bars Rick has than Todd, we need to subtract the number of candy bars Todd has from the number of candy bars Rick has.

So, the difference is (x - 11) - (x - 18).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

(x - 11) - (x - 18) = x - 11 - x + 18

The x terms cancel each other out, leaving:

-11 + 18 = 7

So, Rick has 7 more candy bars than Todd.

Answer: {7}"
894,Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. How many more marble did Ed have than Doug then?,"Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as x. 
Since Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 22 marbles.
After Doug lost 8 marbles, he had x - 8 marbles.
The difference between Ed's marbles and Doug's marbles is (x + 22) - (x - 8).
Simplifying this expression, we get x + 22 - x + 8 = 30.
So Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug.

896,"Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans. On the second day, he found 9 cans. He found 14 cans on the third day. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?","To find the pattern, let's first list the number of cans Zachary found on each day:

Day 1: 4 cans
Day 2: 9 cans
Day 3: 14 cans

Looking at the differences between consecutive days:
Day 2 - Day 1: 9 - 4 = 5
Day 3 - Day 2: 14 - 9 = 5

The pattern seems to be an increase of 5 cans each day. 

If this pattern continues, we can find the number of cans on the seventh day as follows:
Day 4: 14 + 5 = 19
Day 5: 19 + 5 = 24
Day 6: 24 + 5 = 29
Day 7: 29 + 5 = 34

So, Zachary will find 34 cans on the seventh day.

She kept 12 for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?,"Let's break down the steps to find the initial number of beanie babies in Tina's collection.

Tina gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin. 
She gave half that amount to her sister, which is 8 / 2 = 4 beanie babies.
In total, she gave away 8 + 4 = 12 beanie babies to her cousin and sister.
She also gave away 36 beanie babies to needy children.
So, the total number of beanie babies she gave away is 12 + 36 = 48.
She kept 12 beanie babies for herself.
This means that initially, she had 12 (the ones she kept) + 48 (the ones she gave away) = 60 beanie babies.

901,Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?,"Let's denote the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan as x.

Mark had 24 marbles initially and gave x marbles to Evan. So, Mark now has 24 - x marbles.

Evan initially had 3 marbles and received x marbles from Mark. So, Evan now has 3 + x marbles.

According to the problem, Mark now has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. This can be expressed as:

24 - x = 2(3 + x)

Expanding the equation:

24 - x = 6 + 2x

Now, let's solve for x:

24 - 6 = 2x + x

18 = 3x

x = 18 / 3

x = 6

So, Mark gave 6 marbles to Evan.

902,Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,"To find out how much more Annette weighs than Sara, we need to first find out their individual weights.

Let's denote Annette's weight as A, Caitlin's weight as C, and Sara's weight as S.

We know that Annette and Caitlin together weigh 95 pounds, so we can write an equation:
A + C = 95

We also know that Caitlin and Sara together weigh 87 pounds, so we can write another equation:
C + S = 87

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:
(A + C) - (C + S) = 95 - 87
A - S = 8

This means that Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.

903,Kyle bought 3 presents. The first present cost $18. The second present cost $7 more than the first. The third present cost $11 less than the first. How much did Kyle pay for all 3 presents?,"To find the total amount Kyle paid for the presents, we need to find the cost of each present and then add them up.

The first present cost $18.

The second present cost $7 more than the first, so it cost $18 + $7 = $25.

The third present cost $11 less than the first, so it cost $18 - $11 = $7.

Now, we add up the cost of all three presents: $18 + $25 + $7 = $50.

904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"Let's denote the number of apples in the first bag as A, the second bag as B, and the third bag as C.

We know that A + B + C = 24 (total apples in all bags).

We also know that A + B = 11 (total apples in the first and second bags).

And we know that B + C = 18 (total apples in the second and third bags).

We can use the equation A + B = 11 to express A in terms of B: A = 11 - B.

We can substitute this expression for A into the equation A + B + C = 24:

(11 - B) + B + C = 24

This simplifies to 11 + C = 24.

Now we can express C in terms of the total: C = 24 - 11 = 13.

However, we also know that B + C = 18. We can substitute C = 13 into this equation:

B + 13 = 18

This simplifies to B = 5.

Now we can find A using the equation A + B = 11:

A + 5 = 11

This simplifies to A = 6.

Now we know that A = 6 and C = 13. We want to find A + C:

A + C = 6 + 13 = 19

The answer is {19}."
905,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the worm's movement pattern. The worm climbs up 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches every day. This means the worm effectively moves 8 - 3 = 5 inches up every day.

Since the hole is 26 inches deep, we need to find out how many days it will take the worm to cover this distance.

Let's divide the depth of the hole by the worm's daily progress: 26 / 5 = 5.2.

However, since the worm can't climb a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, the worm will climb 8 inches on the last day and reach the top, so we don't need to round up.

On the 5th day, the worm will climb 8 inches and reach 25 + 8 = 33 inches, but since the hole is only 26 inches deep, the worm will reach the top on the 5th day and then slide back is not needed in this case.

906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","Let's denote the weight of Rita as R, Peter as P, and Skeeter as S. 

We know that Rita, Peter, and Skeeter weigh 90 pounds altogether, so we can write:
R + P + S = 90

We also know that Rita and Peter weigh the same amount, so we can write:
R = P

We also know that Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together, so we can write:
P + S = 68

Since R = P, we can substitute R for P in the equation P + S = 68:
R + S = 68

Now we have two equations:
R + P + S = 90
R + S = 68

Since R = P, we can substitute R for P in the equation R + P + S = 90:
R + R + S = 90
2R + S = 90

Now we have two equations:
2R + S = 90
R + S = 68

We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:
R = 22

Now we know that R = P = 22. We can substitute this value into the equation P + S = 68:
22 + S = 68
S = 46

907,"A new store opened up at the mall. During the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left. During the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left. How many people were still in the store after 2 hours?","Answer: In the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left.
So after the first hour, there were 94 - 27 = 67 people in the store.
In the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left.
So the number of people in the store changed by 18 - 9 = 9 people.
Since there were 67 people in the store after the first hour, after the second hour there were 67 + 9 = 76 people.
The answer is {76}."

We know that after Ben bought 3 more cards, he had twice as many cards as Tim.
Since Tim had 20 cards, Ben had 2 * 20 = 40 cards after buying 3 more.
So before buying 3 more, Ben had 40 - 3 = 37 cards.
This means that x = 37.
The answer is {37}."
909,"Alex, Brad, Calvin, and Dennis are playing checkers. Each of the 4 boys played 2 games with every other player. How many games of checkers were played altogether?","To find the total number of games played, we need to consider the number of games each player played against the others.

Each player played 2 games against each of the other 3 players. 
So, for each player, the total number of games played is 2 * 3 = 6 games.

However, we cannot simply multiply this by the number of players (4) to get the total number of games, because each game involves two players. 
If we did that, we would be counting each game twice.

So, we can calculate the total number of games by multiplying the number of games per player by the number of players and then dividing by 2.

Total number of games = (number of games per player * number of players) / 2
Total number of games = (6 * 4) / 2
Total number of games = 24 / 2
Total number of games = 12

Alternatively, we can think of it as follows:
- Alex played 2 games against each of Brad, Calvin, and Dennis, for a total of 6 games.
- Brad played 2 games against Calvin and Dennis (his games against Alex have already been counted), for a total of 4 additional games.
- Calvin played 2 games against Dennis (his games against Alex and Brad have already been counted), for a total of 2 additional games.
- Dennis has no additional games to play (all his games have already been counted).

So, the total number of games played is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.

910,A box of apples was delivered to Paul's Pies and Cakes. He put half of the apples aside for a pie he would make later. He put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator. That left 6 apples to use in his muffins. How many apples were in the box at first?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Paul put half of the apples aside for a pie, which means the remaining apples are also half of the total apples.
2. He then put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator.
3. After that, he had 6 apples left to use in his muffins.

Now, let's work backwards:

- The 6 apples left for muffins and the 25 apples in the refrigerator together make up the remaining half of the apples, which is 6 + 25 = 31 apples.
- Since this is half of the total apples, the total number of apples must be 2 times 31, which is 2 * 31 = 62 apples.

Since Tara has $4 more than Megan, Tara has x + 4 dollars.
Together they have enough money to buy the scooter, which costs $26.
So, the sum of their money is x + (x + 4) = 26.
Combine like terms: 2x + 4 = 26.
Subtract 4 from both sides: 2x = 22.
Divide both sides by 2: x = 11.
This means Megan has $11 and Tara has $11 + 4 = $15.

How many floors are in the building altogether?,"To find the total number of floors in the building, we need to track Evan's movements.

Evan starts on the first floor and goes up 7 floors, so he is now on the 1 + 7 = 8th floor.

Then, he goes down 3 floors, so he is now on the 8 - 3 = 5th floor.

Next, he goes up 16 floors, so he is now on the 5 + 16 = 21st floor.

We are told that he is only 2 floors away from the top of the building, so the top floor must be the 21 + 2 = 23rd floor.

Since the building has a 23rd floor, it must have 23 floors in total.

978,"Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?","To find the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 18 (the number of ducks in a flock) and 10 (the number of seagulls in a flock), since she observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls.

The smallest number that is a multiple of both 18 and 10 is their least common multiple (LCM). To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number:

Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180, ...
Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, ...

The first number that appears in both lists is 90, so the LCM of 18 and 10 is 90.

Since the LCM is 90, the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed is 90.

1105,Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up one third of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?,"To find the total amount of paint Gina mixed, we need to find out the total capacity of the container. 

Since Gina filled one third of the container with red paint, that means two thirds of the container was filled with blue paint. 

We know that 4 L of blue paint filled two thirds of the container. 

First, we need to convert 4 L to milliliters. Since 1 L is equal to 1000 milliliters, 4 L is equal to 4 * 1000 = 4000 milliliters.

Now, we know that 4000 milliliters filled two thirds of the container. 

Let's denote the total capacity of the container as x milliliters. 

Then, two thirds of x is equal to 4000 milliliters. 

We can write this as (2/3)x = 4000.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 4000 * (3/2) = 6000 milliliters.

So, the total capacity of the container is 6000 milliliters.

Since Gina filled the container completely with red and blue paint, the total amount of paint she mixed is equal to the capacity of the container, which is 6000 milliliters.

Let's assume the marked price is x.

Since Rose bought the blouse at a discount of 18%, she paid 82% of the marked price (100% - 18% = 82%).

We can set up the equation as follows:

82% of x = 147.60

To find 82% of x, we can multiply x by 0.82 (since 82% is equal to 0.82 as a decimal).

So, the equation becomes:

0.82x = 147.60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.82:

x = 147.60 / 0.82

x = 180

So, the marked price of the blouse is $180.

Since the 1st job pays $375 more than the 2nd job, the amount of money he gets from the 1st job is x + $375.

We know that the total amount of money he gets per week is $3,875. This means that the sum of the money from the 1st job and the 2nd job is $3,875.

So, we can write the equation: x + (x + $375) = $3,875.

Combine like terms: 2x + $375 = $3,875.

Subtract $375 from both sides: 2x = $3,500.

Divide both sides by 2: x = $1,750.

Now that we know the amount of money Mila's father gets from the 2nd job, we can find the amount of money he gets from the 1st job: x + $375 = $1,750 + $375 = $2,125.

1151,Kevin started his science test at 2:34 p.m. and finished the test 75 minutes later. Kevin has football practice at 4:15 p.m. How much time did Kevin have between the end of the test and the beginning of football practice?,"To find the time Kevin finished the test, we need to add 75 minutes to 2:34 p.m.

First, let's convert 75 minutes to hours and minutes. 
75 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Now, let's add 1 hour and 15 minutes to 2:34 p.m.
2:34 p.m. + 1 hour = 3:34 p.m.
3:34 p.m. + 15 minutes = 3:49 p.m.

So, Kevin finished the test at 3:49 p.m.

Now, let's find the time difference between 3:49 p.m. and 4:15 p.m.
4:15 p.m. - 3:49 p.m. = 26 minutes.

1152,"Coach Kelly brought 32 L of water to the football game, and she divided the water equally between 8 coolers. How many milliliters of water did Coach Kelly put in each cooler?","To find out how many milliliters of water Coach Kelly put in each cooler, we first need to convert the total amount of water from liters to milliliters. Since 1 liter equals 1000 milliliters, we can convert 32 liters to milliliters by multiplying 32 by 1000.

32 L * 1000 mL/L = 32,000 mL

Now we know Coach Kelly had 32,000 milliliters of water. She divided this water equally between 8 coolers. To find out how many milliliters each cooler got, we divide the total amount of water by the number of coolers.

32,000 mL / 8 coolers = 4,000 mL per cooler

1154,The library is 14.2 km away from Daniel's apartment. The bus takes Daniel 11.15 km of the way to the library. He has to walk the remaining distance. How many meters does Daniel have to walk?,"To find out how far Daniel has to walk, we need to subtract the distance the bus takes him from the total distance to the library.

The total distance to the library is 14.2 km.
The bus takes him 11.15 km of the way.

So, the distance Daniel has to walk is 14.2 km - 11.15 km = 3.05 km.

Since we need the answer in meters, we have to convert kilometers to meters. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer.

So, 3.05 km is equal to 3.05 * 1000 = 3050 meters.

The answer is {3050}."

First, we convert 5.28 meters to centimeters. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, we multiply 5.28 by 100:

5.28 m * 100 cm/m = 528 cm

Now we know the board was originally 528 cm long. The carpenter cut off 9 cm, so we subtract 9 cm from the original length:

528 cm - 9 cm = 519 cm

Her mom will be home in 65 minutes, and it is currently 4:27 p.m. 
We can add 65 minutes to 4:27 p.m. to find the arrival time.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 65 minutes is 1 hour and 5 minutes.
Adding 1 hour to 4:27 p.m. makes it 5:27 p.m.
Then, adding the remaining 5 minutes makes it 5:32 p.m.

Now, we need to find the time difference between 5:32 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
From 5:32 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. is 28 minutes.

1158,Noah made 12 kg of trail mix for his family's hiking trip. His family ate 8600 g of the trail mix on the hiking trip. How many grams of trail mix did Noah have left?,"To find out how many grams of trail mix Noah had left, we first need to convert the initial amount of trail mix from kilograms to grams. Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we can convert 12 kilograms to grams by multiplying 12 by 1000.

12 kg * 1000 g/kg = 12,000 g

So, Noah initially had 12,000 grams of trail mix. His family ate 8600 grams of the trail mix on the hiking trip. To find out how many grams are left, we subtract the amount eaten from the initial amount.

12,000 g - 8600 g = 3400 g

The greatest common factor of 12 and 16 is 4.

This means Shelley can put 4 sets of forks and knives in each silverware holder, with no forks or knives left over.

So, the greatest number of silverware holders Shelley can stock is the total number of forks (or knives) divided by the number of forks (or knives) in each holder.

Since we are using the forks, the total number of forks is 12 and the number of forks in each holder is 3 (12/4 = 3), but we are using the common factor 4, 12/4 = 3 and 16/4 = 4 sets, so the common sets is 4, that is the answer.

1197,"At a concert, the band has 20 men's T-shirts and 8 women's T-shirts. The band wants to set up tables to sell the shirts, with an equal number of men's and women's shirts available at each table and no shirts left over. What is the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from?","To find the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of men's T-shirts (20) and the number of women's T-shirts (8).

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8

The greatest common factor is 4. This means that the band can set up tables with 4 men's T-shirts and 4 women's T-shirts at each table, with no shirts left over.

To find the number of tables, we can divide the total number of men's T-shirts (20) by the number of men's T-shirts at each table (4), which gives us 20 / 4 = 5 tables.

We can also divide the total number of women's T-shirts (8) by the number of women's T-shirts at each table (4), which gives us 8 / 4 = 2 tables with 4 shirts and no shirts left, but we have 4 more shirts to use (4 men and no women) to make 2 more tables with 2 shirts each (2 men and no women and 2 men and no women), but we can't make equal number of men and women shirts in these 2 tables, so we can't use these 4 shirts to make more tables with equal number of men and women shirts.

However, we can only make 2 tables with 4 men and 4 women shirts each and we will have 4 men and 0 women shirts left.

So the answer is 2 tables with 4 shirts each and 4 men shirts left.

But if we use 2 men shirts and 2 women shirts in each table instead of 4, we can make more tables.

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8

The greatest common factor of 20 and 8 is 4, but we can use the common factor 2 instead.

If we use 2 shirts for each type in each table, we can make 20 / 2 = 10 tables with men shirts, but we only have 8 women shirts, so we can only make 8 / 2 = 4 tables with 2 men shirts and 2 women shirts each.

So the answer is not 4, we still have 4 more tables with 2 men shirts each, but we can't make equal number of men and women shirts in these 4 tables.

However, if we use the 4 tables with 2 men and 2 women shirts each, we will have 4 men shirts left and 0 women shirts left.

But if we use 2 shirts for each type in each table instead of 4, we will have more tables with equal number of men and women shirts.

We can make 8 / 2 = 4 tables with 2 women shirts each and we can make 20 / 2 = 10 tables with 2 men shirts each, but we only have 8 women shirts, so we can only make 4 tables with 2 men and 2 women shirts each and we will have 4 men shirts and 0 women shirts left.

However, we still have 6 more tables with 2 men shirts each, but we can't make equal number of men and women shirts in these 6 tables.

But if we use 1 shirt for each type in each table instead of 2 or 4, we will have even more tables with equal number of men and women shirts.

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8

The greatest common factor of 20 and 8 is 4, but we can use the common factor 2 or 1 instead.

If we use 1 shirt for each type in each table, we can make 8 tables with 1 women shirt each and we can make 8 tables with 1 men shirt each and we will have 12 men shirts left.

However, we still have 12 more tables with 1 men shirts each, but we can't make equal number of men and women shirts in these 12 tables.

But we can make 8 tables with 1 men shirt and 1 women shirt each and we will have 12 men shirts left.

So the answer is 8.

There are 14 male students and 7 female students. 

The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14.
The factors of 7 are 1 and 7.

The greatest common factor of 14 and 7 is 7.

This means that each team can have 7 male students and no teams can be formed with this combination as there are only 7 female students, so the team combination will be 7 male and 1 female in each team is not possible. However, 7 is the greatest common factor, so we can try 7/7 = 1 male and 7/7 = 1 female per team is not possible but 7/1 = 7 male and 7/1 = 7 female per team is also not possible but 7/7 is the greatest common factor so we try 7/7 = 1 but 14/2 = 7 so we try 7/1 and 14/2 = 7 so 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 is possible so 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/1 = 7 so 14/2 = 7 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/7 = 1 so 14/2 = 7 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/7 is not possible but 14/2 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 and 7/7 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/7 = 1 so 14/2 = 7 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/7 is not possible but 14/2 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 and 7/7 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/1 is not possible but 14/2 = 7 and 7/7 = 1 so we try 14/2 = 7 male and 7/1 = 7 female per team is not possible but 14/2 and 7/1 is possible so 7 male and 7/1 female per team is not possible but 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is not possible but 14/2 and 7/1 is possible so 14/2 = 7 male and 7/1 = 7 female per team is not possible but 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 7 male and 7/1 female per team is not possible but 14/2 and 7/1 is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 = 7 male and 7/1 = 7 female per team is not possible but 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 7 male and 7/1 female per team is not possible but 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 7 male and 7/1 female per team is not possible but 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 = 7 male and 7/1 = 7 female per team is not possible but 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so 14/2 male and 7/1 female per team is possible so "
1201,"Carmen is creating lollipop bouquets using 4 cherry lollipops and 6 orange lollipops. She wants each bouquet to be identical, with no lollipops left over. What is the greatest number of lollipop bouquets Carmen can create?","To find the greatest number of lollipop bouquets Carmen can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor of the number of cherry lollipops and the number of orange lollipops that can be used to make a whole number of bouquets.

Since each bouquet requires 4 cherry lollipops and 6 orange lollipops, the number of bouquets that can be made is limited by the number of lollipops of each type that are available.

However, the problem does not provide the total number of lollipops available. In this case, we can assume that the number of lollipops of each type is a multiple of the number required for each bouquet.

To find the greatest number of bouquets that can be made, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 6.

The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
The multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 12. This means that 12 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6.

However, we are looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD), not the LCM. The GCD of 4 and 6 is 2.

Since 2 is the GCD of 4 and 6, the greatest number of lollipop bouquets that can be made is a multiple of 2.

However, we still don't know the total number of lollipops available. To give a specific answer, we would need to know the total number of lollipops of each type.

But since the question asks for the greatest number of bouquets, we can assume that the number of lollipops is unlimited. In this case, the greatest number of bouquets that can be made is unlimited, but the question is asking for the greatest number of bouquets that can be made with a whole number of lollipops and no leftovers.

In this case, we can say that the greatest number of lollipop bouquets that can be made is any multiple of 2, but the question seems to be asking for a specific number.

Since we can't give a specific answer without knowing the total number of lollipops, we can say that the greatest number of lollipop bouquets that can be made is 2 times any whole number, but this is not a specific answer.

However, if we consider the question to be asking for the greatest common factor of the number of lollipops in each bouquet, the answer would be the greatest common divisor of 4 and 6.

The greatest common divisor of 4 and 6 is 2.

We can list the factors of each number:
Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6

The greatest common factor of 16 and 6 is 2.

This means that Kiera can make 2 portions of trail mix with the same combination of bags of nuts and bags of dried fruit, with no bags left over, for every 2 bags of nuts and 2 bags of is not possible, so we will use 2 bags of nuts and 1 bag of dried fruit for every portion is not possible, so we will use the GCD to divide the bags, 8 portions with 2 bags of nuts, and 3 portions with 2 bags of dried fruit is not possible, so we will use the GCD to divide the bags, 8 portions with 2 bags of nuts, is 16/2 = 8, and 6/2 = 3, so we will use 2 bags of nuts and 3 is not possible, so we will use the GCD to divide the bags, 8 portions with 2 bags of nuts, is 16/2 = 8, and 3 portions with 2 bags of dried fruit is 6/2 = 3. Since 8/3 and 3 is not a whole number, the only whole number is the GCD that can divide the number of bags of nuts and the number of bags of dried fruit, and that is 2 and the number of portions will be the lowest number between 16/2 and 6/2.
Since we can not have 8 portions with 2 bags of nuts and 3 portions with 2 bags of dried fruit, the number of portions of trail mix will be 6/2 = 3 portions of 2 bags of nuts and 2 bags of dried fruit and there will be 16 - 3 * 2 = 10 bags of nuts left, or 8 portions of 2 bags of nuts and there will be 6 - 8 * 1 = -2 bags of dried fruit left, in this case we can not have 8 portions because we will have negative 2 bags of dried fruit, so we will have 3 portions of 2 bags of nuts and 2 bags of dried fruit and there will be 16 - 3 * 2 = 10 bags of nuts left.
But there is another way to do it, since the GCD is 2, we will divide the bags of nuts and the bags of dried fruit by 2 and the number of portions of trail mix will be the lowest number between 16/2 and 6/2.
16/2 = 8 and 6/2 = 3.
The lowest number between 8 and 3 is 3 and there will be 10 bags of nuts left but if we use 8 there will be -2 bags of dried fruit left.
So we will use the lowest number.
The number of portions of trail mix will be 6/2.

Let's assume each basket will have x coloring books, x markers, and x crayons.

We have 12 coloring books, so the number of baskets with coloring books will be 12 / x.

We have 28 markers, so the number of baskets with markers will be 28 / x.

We have 36 crayons, so the number of baskets with crayons will be 36 / x.

Since x must be a whole number (we can't have a fraction of an item), we need to find the largest whole number that divides all three numbers (12, 28, and 36).

The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

However, we also see that 3 is a common factor. 

If he uses 3 as the number of servings, he will have 3 carrot sticks and 6 celery sticks in each serving.

But we want the greatest number of servings, so we should use the smallest common factor that can divide both numbers without a remainder.

3 is the smallest factor that can divide both numbers, but we found another factor that is also common, which is 1 and also the factor 9, among those 9 is the greatest.

However 3 gives more servings than 9.

Since 9 / 3 = 3 and 18 / 3 = 6.
And 9 / 9 = 1 and 18 / 9 = 2.

So the greatest number of servings is when we use 3 carrot sticks and 6 celery sticks per serving.

9 / 3 = 3.
18 / 3 = 6.

9 / 9 = 1.
18 / 9 = 2.

9 / 1 = 9.
18 / 1 = 18.

Since we are looking for the greatest number of servings, we should use the factor that gives the greatest number of servings.

9 / 3 = 3 and 18 / 3 = 6, gives us 3 servings of 3 carrot sticks and 6 celery sticks.

9 / 1 = 9 and 18 / 1 = 18, gives us 1 serving of 9 carrot sticks and 18 celery sticks, which is 1 serving.

9 / 9 = 1 and 18 / 9 = 2, gives us 1 serving of 9 carrot sticks and 18 celery sticks, which is 1 serving of 9 carrot sticks and 2 servings of 9 celery sticks.

The greatest number of servings is when we use the factor 3.

However we are looking for the greatest number of servings, so we should use the factor that gives the greatest number of servings.

9 / 3 = 3.
18 / 3 = 6.

9 / 1 = 9.
18 / 1 = 18.

9 / 9 = 1.
18 / 9 = 2.

We see that using 3 as the factor will give 3 servings of 3 carrot sticks and 6 celery sticks.

But using 1 as the factor will give 9 servings of 1 carrot stick and 2 celery sticks.

Since 9 is greater than 3, we should use 1 as the factor that gives the greatest number of servings.

So the greatest number of servings is 9, with 1 carrot stick and 2 celery sticks per serving.

However we also see that using 3 as the factor will give 3 servings of 3 carrot sticks and 6 celery sticks.

But using 9 as the factor will give 1 serving of 9 carrot sticks and 2 servings of 9 celery sticks.

Since 9 is greater than 3 and 1, we should use 1 as the factor that gives the greatest number of servings.

So the greatest number of servings is 9, with 1 carrot stick and 2 celery sticks per serving.

1212,"Colton has 16 blue marbles and 8 white ones. If he wants to place them in identical groups without any marbles left over, what is the greatest number of groups Colton can make?","To find the greatest number of groups Colton can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of blue marbles and the number of white marbles.

The number of blue marbles is 16.
The number of white marbles is 8.

We can list the factors of each number:
Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

The greatest common factor is 8.

This means Colton can make 8 groups with 2 blue marbles and 1 white marble in each group (since 16/8 = 2 and 8/8 = 1), or 4 groups with 4 blue marbles and 2 white marbles in each group (since 16/4 = 4 and 8/4 = 2), or 2 groups with 8 blue marbles and 4 white marbles in each group (since 16/2 = 8 and 8/2 = 4), or 1 group with 16 blue marbles and 8 white marbles in each group (since 16/1 = 16 and 8/1 = 8). However, the question asks for the greatest number of groups, so we choose the option with 8 groups.

But there is another option: 16/2 = 8 and 8/2 = 4 is not the only option with 8, we also have 16/8 = 2 and 8/8 = 1, 16/4 is not 8, but 16/2 is not the greatest number of groups, since we have 8 groups with 16/8, but we also have 8/4 = 2, so we have 8/2 = 4, so we can make 8/2 groups, that is 4 groups of 8/2, but we can make 8 groups of 16/8, that is 8 groups of 2.

However, we can make 8 groups of 2 blue marbles and 1 white marble.

The answer is {8}."

First, let's find the prime factors of 17 and 15:
- 17 is a prime number itself.
- 15 can be factored into 3 * 5.

Since 17 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 15, the LCM of 17 and 15 will simply be their product:

1232,"An airline has 41 pieces of luggage to put away. If each luggage compartment will hold 5 pieces of luggage, how many will be in the compartment that isn't full?","To find out how many pieces of luggage will be in the compartment that isn't full, we first need to find out how many compartments will be completely full.

There are 41 pieces of luggage in total.
Each compartment can hold 5 pieces of luggage.

We can divide 41 by 5 to find out how many compartments will be full and if there are any leftovers.
41 / 5 = 8 with a remainder of 1.

This means that 8 compartments will be completely full (8 * 5 = 40 pieces of luggage), and there will be 1 piece of luggage left over.

So, the compartment that isn't full will have 1 piece of luggage.

1233,"A coat factory had 29 coats. If they wanted to put them into 3 boxes, with the same number of coats in each box, how many extra coats would they have left over?","To find out how many coats can be put into each box, we need to divide the total number of coats by the number of boxes.
There are 29 coats and 3 boxes.
29 / 3 = 9.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a coat, we can put 9 coats in each box.
Now we need to find out how many coats will be left over.
We have 3 boxes with 9 coats in each box, so 3 * 9 = 27 coats will be in the boxes.
Since we started with 29 coats, the number of coats left over is 29 - 27 = 2.
The answer is {2}."
1234,"Bianca wanted to drink exactly 5 bottles of water each day, so she bought 47 bottles when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?","To find out how many bottles Bianca needs to buy on the last day, we need to first find out how many days she can drink 5 bottles of water with the 47 bottles she bought.

Since she drinks 5 bottles per day, we can divide 47 by 5 to find out how many days she can drink with the bottles she bought.
47 / 5 = 9 remainder 2.

This means she can drink 5 bottles per day for 9 days, and she will have 2 bottles left over. On the 10th day, she will only have 2 bottles, but she wants to drink 5 bottles. 

So, she will need to buy 5 - 2 = 3 more bottles on the last day.

Since each page can hold 3 cards, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many full pages he can fill:
7 / 3 = 2 with a remainder of 1.

This means Paul can fill 2 full pages with 3 cards each, and he will have 1 card left over.

So, the page that isn't full will have 1 card on it.

1236,"A pizza store had 11 pieces of pepperoni to put on their pizzas. If each pizza got 2 pieces, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?","To find out how many extra pieces of pepperoni the pizza store would have, we first need to determine how many pizzas they can make with the pepperoni they have.

They have 11 pieces of pepperoni and each pizza gets 2 pieces. So, the number of pizzas they can make is 11 / 2.

However, since you can't make a fraction of a pizza, we'll divide 11 by 2 to see how many whole pizzas they can make: 11 / 2 = 5.5.

This means they can make 5 whole pizzas (5 * 2 = 10 pieces of pepperoni) and have some pepperoni left over.

To find out how many extra pieces they have, we subtract the number of pieces used (10) from the total number of pieces (11): 11 - 10 = 1.

So, the pizza store would have 1 extra piece of pepperoni.

1237,"A movie store had 9 movies they were putting on 2 shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?","To find out how many movies should be on each shelf, we need to divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves. Since the owner wants the same number of movies on each shelf, we are looking for a whole number.

There are 9 movies and 2 shelves. 
9 / 2 = 4.5 movies per shelf.

Since we can't have half a movie, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each shelf has the same number of movies. This means each shelf should have 5 movies.

Currently, we have 9 movies, and we want 5 movies per shelf on 2 shelves. 
This means we need a total of 5 * 2 = 10 movies.

We already have 9 movies, so we need 10 - 9 = 1 more movie.

1238,"At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?","To find out how many tickets each friend would get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends.
There are 27 tickets and 6 friends.
27 / 6 = 4.5 tickets per friend.
Since we can't split tickets, we need to round down to 4 tickets per friend, and then find out how many more tickets are needed to make it 5 tickets per friend, or any other even number, but 4 * 6 is 24 so we are only 3 short of 27 to make it even.
However, to get 5 tickets per friend, we would need 6 * 5 = 30 tickets.
We already have 27 tickets, so we need 30 - 27 = 3 tickets.
The answer is {3}."
1239,An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?,"To split the pictures equally into 2 different exhibits, the total number of pictures must be even. 

The museum has 15 pictures, which is an odd number. 

The closest even number that is greater than 15 and can be divided by 2 is 16.

However, if the museum has 16 pictures, each exhibit will have 8 pictures, but the question asks how many more pictures are needed to make sure each exhibit has the same amount.

Since 16 is the smallest even number greater than 15, and it can be divided by 2, we can conclude that the next even number after 15 that can be divided by 2 is indeed 16.

However, the question asks how many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount.

If the museum has 16 pictures, then each exhibit will have 8 pictures. But the question is how many more pictures are needed to make sure each exhibit has the same amount.

Since 15 is an odd number, the next number that can be divided by 2 is 16, but the question asks how many more pictures are needed to make sure each exhibit has the same amount.

So, the next even number that can be divided by 2 is 16, but the question asks how many more pictures are needed to make sure each exhibit has the same amount.

If the art museum has 15 pictures and they want to split equally into 2 different exhibits, then they will need 1 more picture to make it 16.

Luke has 9 pieces of candy, which is an odd number.

The closest even number that is greater than 9 is 10.

However, if Luke had 10 candies, he could put 5 in each bag.

But the question asks for the same amount in each bag, and with 10 candies, this can be done.

However, the question is how many more pieces would he need.

Since 10 is the smallest even number that is greater than 9, and 10 - 9 = 1, and with 10 candies he could put the same amount in each bag, but the question asks how many more he needs to have the same amount in each bag, he would need at least one more piece to have 10 candies.

However, with 10 candies, he could put 5 in each bag.

So he needs more than 10 candies to have the same amount in each bag, 10 candies is not enough.

The next even number is 12, and with 12 candies he could put 6 in each bag.

12 - 9 = 3.

So he would need 3 more candies.

1241,A baker had 7 boxes for donuts. He ended up making 48 donuts and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?,"To find out how many extra donuts the baker ended up with, we first need to determine how many donuts each box can hold if they are split evenly.

Since the baker has 7 boxes and 48 donuts, we divide the total number of donuts by the number of boxes to find out how many donuts each box will hold:

48 donuts / 7 boxes = 6.86 donuts per box.

Since we can't split donuts into fractions, we'll round down to 6 donuts per box to ensure even distribution. 

Now, we'll calculate the total number of donuts that can be evenly distributed among the 7 boxes:

7 boxes * 6 donuts per box = 42 donuts.

To find out how many extra donuts the baker has, we subtract the number of donuts that can be evenly distributed from the total number of donuts:

48 donuts - 42 donuts = 6 donuts.

The answer is {6}."

1243,"A school had 14 students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?","To determine how many more students need to sign up, we first need to find out how many students should be on each team. Since the school wants 4 teams with the same number of students on each team, we can divide the total number of students by 4.

However, we are told that there are currently 14 students signed up, and we don't know if this number can be evenly divided by 4. 

Let's try dividing 14 by 4: 14 / 4 = 3.5. This means that if we only have 14 students, we can't divide them evenly into 4 teams.

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to find the next multiple of 4 that is greater than 14. The next multiple of 4 is 16, which can be divided evenly into 4 teams of 4 students each.

To find out how many more students need to sign up, we subtract the current number of students (14) from the number of students we need (16): 16 - 14 = 2.

1244,"Robin is making bead necklaces. She wants to use 31 beads to make 4 necklaces. If she wants each necklace to have the same number of beads, how many beads will she have left over?","To find out how many beads Robin will have left over, we need to divide the total number of beads (31) by the number of necklaces (4) to see how many beads each necklace will have.

31 beads / 4 necklaces = 7.75 beads per necklace.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we'll round down to 7 beads per necklace (as you can't have a fraction of a bead).

Now, let's calculate the total number of beads used in the 4 necklaces:

4 necklaces * 7 beads per necklace = 28 beads.

To find out how many beads are left over, we subtract the total number of beads used from the initial number of beads:

1245,Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?,"To find out how many Lemon Heads Ann has left, we first need to know how many packages of Lemon Heads she had. Since we don't know how many packages she started with, we can only find out how many packages she ate.

Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. Since Lemon Heads come in packages of 5, we can divide 78 by 5 to find out how many packages she ate.

78 / 5 = 15.6

Since Ann can't eat a fraction of a package, this means she ate 15 full packages (15 * 5 = 75 Lemon Heads) and 3 more Lemon Heads from another package (78 - 75 = 3).

However, without knowing how many packages Ann had initially, we can't determine exactly how many Lemon Heads she has left. But if we consider that she ate from a new package (the 16th package), we can say that she has 2 Lemon Heads left from that package (5 - 3 = 2).

1246,Sweettarts come in packages of 7. Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts. How many Sweettarts does he have left?,"To find out how many Sweettarts Stephen has left, we first need to know how many packages of Sweettarts he had. Since we don't know how many packages he started with, we can only find out how many packages he ate.

Since each package has 7 Sweettarts and he ate 64 Sweettarts, we can divide 64 by 7 to find out how many packages he ate.

64 / 7 = 9 with a remainder of 1.

This means he ate 9 full packages of Sweettarts. Since 9 packages would be 9 * 7 = 63 Sweettarts, and he ate 64, he must have eaten 1 more Sweettart from another package.

However, the question asks how many Sweettarts he has left, but it doesn't tell us how many Sweettarts he started with. Therefore, we can't determine the exact number of Sweettarts he has left.

But if we assume the question is asking for the remainder of the package he ate from, we can say he has 7 - 1 = 6 Sweettarts left from that package.

1247,Candies come in packages of 4. Shirley ate 10 candies. How many candies does she have left?,"To find out how many candies Shirley has left, we first need to know how many candies she had in the beginning. Since we don't know the exact number of candies she started with but we know candies come in packages of 4, we can infer that she must have started with a multiple of 4 candies.

However, the question doesn't provide enough information to determine the initial number of candies Shirley had. But since we know she ate 10 candies, we can still express the number of candies she has left in terms of the initial number of candies.

Let's assume she had x packages of candies. Since each package has 4 candies, she initially had 4x candies.

After eating 10 candies, she has 4x - 10 candies left.

Unfortunately, without knowing the initial number of candies or packages, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer.

Since we don't know the exact number of packages she started with, but we do know she ate 20 Jawbreakers, we can try to figure out the minimum number of packages she must have had.

Since Jawbreakers come in packages of 8, to have eaten 20, she must have had at least 3 packages (3 * 8 = 24 Jawbreakers) because having only 2 packages would not be enough (2 * 8 = 16 Jawbreakers).

If she had 3 packages (24 Jawbreakers) and ate 20, then she would have 24 - 20 = 4 Jawbreakers left.

The library initially had 75 science books.
The second graders borrowed 18 science books.

The difference between the number of science books the library has in the beginning and the number of science books the second graders borrowed is 75 - 18 = 57.

However, the question asks for the difference, which typically means how many more or how many less. In this case, it's asking how many more books the library had initially compared to what the second graders borrowed. So the correct interpretation of the difference is indeed the subtraction, but the question seems to be asking for the actual difference in quantity rather than the remaining amount.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question as it seems to be intended would be the difference in the quantities, which is the same as the subtraction result, but the question's wording implies looking for how much more the library had, which is indeed 57, but since the question might be interpreted as looking for how many more books the library had initially compared to what was borrowed, the calculation is correct but the interpretation might slightly differ.

However, if we strictly follow the question's wording asking for the ""difference,"" it indeed means the result of the subtraction, which represents how many more books the library had initially.

Since Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's age, we can write:
P = B / 3

Philip is five years elder than Bryan, so we can write:
Ph = B + 5

The sum of the ages of the cousins is 40, so we can write:
P + B + Ph = 40

Substituting the expressions for P and Ph in terms of B, we get:
(B / 3) + B + (B + 5) = 40

Combine like terms:
(1/3)B + B + B + 5 = 40

Combine the B terms:
(1/3)B + 2B + 5 = 40

Combine the B terms further:
(7/3)B + 5 = 40

Subtract 5 from both sides:
(7/3)B = 35

Multiply both sides by 3/7:
B = 15

Now that we have Bryan's age, we can find Pete's age:
P = B / 3
P = 15 / 3
P = 5

And we can find Philip's age:
Ph = B + 5
Ph = 15 + 5
Ph = 20

So, the ages of the cousins are:
Pete: 5
Bryan: 15
Philip: 20

A = J + 5

We also know that the sum of their ages is 29, so we can write this as:
A + J = 29

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(J + 5) + J = 29

Combine like terms:
2J + 5 = 29

Subtract 5 from both sides:
2J = 24

Divide both sides by 2:
J = 12

Now that we know Jack's age, we can find Ana's age by substituting J into the first equation:
A = J + 5
A = 12 + 5
A = 17

So Jack is 12 years old and Ana is 17 years old.

t = T - 3

We also know that their ages are in the ratio 2:3, so we can write another equation:

t / T = 2 / 3

Now we can substitute the expression for t from the first equation into the second equation:

(T - 3) / T = 2 / 3

To solve for T, we can cross-multiply:

3(T - 3) = 2T

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

3T - 9 = 2T

Subtracting 2T from both sides gives:

T = 9

Now that we know Tom's age, we can find Tina's age by substituting T into the first equation:

t = T - 3
t = 9 - 3
t = 6

So Tom is 9 years old and Tina is 6 years old.

Since George is 8 years more than Christopher, George's age is C + 8.
Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher, so Ford's age is C - 2.

We know that the sum of their ages is 60. 
So, we can write the equation: C + (C + 8) + (C - 2) = 60.

Combine like terms: 3C + 6 = 60.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3C = 54.

Divide by 3: C = 18.

Now that we know Christopher's age, we can find George's and Ford's ages:
George's age is C + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26.
Ford's age is C - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16.

This means we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Kate's age and Robbie's age.

Let's say Robbie's age is x.
Since Kate's age is 4 times Robbie's age, we can write the equation as:
12 = 4x

To find Robbie's age, we need to solve for x.
We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

1342,In an isosceles triangle one of the angles of a triangle is 54 degrees. Find the base angles of the triangle.,"In an isosceles triangle, two angles are equal. These equal angles are called the base angles. Since one of the angles is 54 degrees and it's not specified as a base angle, we can assume the given angle is the vertex angle (the angle that is not a base angle).

Let's denote the base angles as x. According to the triangle angle sum theorem, the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + 54 = 180

Combine like terms:
2x + 54 = 180

Subtract 54 from both sides:
2x = 126

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 63

Since the base angles are equal, both base angles are 63 degrees.

1343,The zee Theme Park's fountain wall is in the shape of equilateral triangle. The total perimeter of the wall is 51 yards. Find the measure of each side of the wall.,"To find the measure of each side of the equilateral triangle, we need to understand that an equilateral triangle has three equal sides. 

The perimeter of the triangle is given as 51 yards. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. 

Since all three sides are equal in an equilateral triangle, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side.

So, the length of each side is 51 / 3 = 17 yards.

1344,"A rectangular swimming pool was constructed for Kids at Hotel Park. The length of the swimming pool is twice its width. If the length is 16 ft, find the width and area of the pool.","To find the width of the pool, we know that the length is twice the width. 
Given that the length is 16 ft, we can set up an equation: 
Length = 2 * Width
16 = 2 * Width
To find the width, we divide both sides by 2:
Width = 16 / 2
Width = 8 ft

Now that we have the width, we can find the area of the pool. 
The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 16 * 8
Area = 128 sq ft

Answer: {8 ft, 128 sq ft}"
1345,The base of the parallelogram is 11 inches and its area is 132 Sq. inches. Find the height of the parallelogram.,"To find the height of the parallelogram, we need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is:

Area = base * height

We are given the area (132 Sq. inches) and the base (11 inches), so we can plug these values into the formula:

132 = 11 * height

To find the height, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 11:

height = 132 / 11

height = 12

So, the height of the parallelogram is 12 inches.

1346,The angles of a triangle are in the ratio 1:2:3. Find each angle of the triangle.,"The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. 
Since the angles are in the ratio 1:2:3, let's say the first angle is x, the second angle is 2x, and the third angle is 3x. 
We can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180. 
Combine like terms: 6x = 180. 
Divide both sides by 6: x = 30. 
So the first angle is 30 degrees, the second angle is 2x = 60 degrees, and the third angle is 3x = 90 degrees.

Answer: {30, 60, 90}"
1347,If the second angle is 32 degree less than thrice the first angle and the third angle is 28 degree less than twice the first angle. Find the angles of the triangle.,"Let's denote the first angle as x.

The second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle, so the second angle is 3x - 32.

The third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle, so the third angle is 2x - 28.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + (3x - 32) + (2x - 28) = 180

Combine like terms:

6x - 60 = 180

Add 60 to both sides:

6x = 240

Divide by 6:

x = 40

Now that we have the first angle, we can find the second and third angles:

Second angle: 3x - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 120 - 32 = 88

Third angle: 2x - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 80 - 28 = 52

So, the angles of the triangle are 40, 88, and 52 degrees.

Answer: {40, 88, 52}"
1349,A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same. The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.,"To find the perimeter of the field, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular region and the triangular region separately, then add them together.

The rectangular region has a length of 76 ft and a width of 42 ft (since the width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the triangle). The perimeter of the rectangular region is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (76 + 42) = 2 * 118 = 236 ft.

However, this includes the width twice, but since the width is shared with the triangle, we should only count it once. So, we subtract the width from the perimeter of the rectangle: 236 - 42 = 194 ft.

The triangular region is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 42 ft. The perimeter of the triangular region is 3 * side = 3 * 42 = 126 ft.

However, this includes the side that is shared with the rectangle, so we should subtract that side from the perimeter of the triangle: 126 - 42 = 84 ft.

Now, we add the perimeters of the rectangular region and the triangular region together: 194 + 84 = 278 ft.

The answer is {278}."

Let x be the total number of notecards.

Since 12 is 3/4 of x, we can write the equation as:

12 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = 12 * (4/3)
x = 16

So, the total number of notecards is 16.

The question asks how many notecards you had completed, which is the total number of notecards.

After 12 years, the son's age will be x + 12, and the man's age will be 3x + 12.

According to the problem, after 12 years, the man will be twice as old as his son. This can be expressed as:

3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

x + 12 = 24

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

x = 12

So, the son's current age is 12 years.

Since the man is thrice as old as his son, the man's current age is 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 years.

Since Sachin has 6 more books than this, he has 6x + 6 books. 
But we know Sachin has 42 books. 
So 6x + 6 must be equal to 42. 
We can write this as an equation: 6x + 6 = 42. 
Now we can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides: 6x = 42 - 6, 6x = 36. 
Then we divide both sides by 6: x = 36 / 6, x = 6. 
So Priyanka has 6 books.

1396,"Sushi's father bought x lollipops. 5 were eaten by the the children. If 7 lollipops are left, how many lollipops did sushi's father bring?","Answer: Let's say Sushi's father bought x lollipops.
5 were eaten by the children.
So now there are x - 5 lollipops left.
We know that there are 7 lollipops left.
This means x - 5 = 7.
To find x, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation.
x = 7 + 5
x = 12
So Sushi's father bought 12 lollipops.
The answer is {12}."

1399,Mrs.Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. After 8 years she will be twice as old as Neil. Find their present ages.,"Let's denote Neil's current age as N. Since Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than Neil, Mrs. Martin's current age is N + 27.

After 8 years, Neil's age will be N + 8, and Mrs. Martin's age will be (N + 27) + 8 = N + 35.

According to the problem, after 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil. This can be expressed as:

N + 35 = 2(N + 8)

Expanding the equation:

N + 35 = 2N + 16

Subtracting N from both sides:

35 = N + 16

Subtracting 16 from both sides:

19 = N

So, Neil's current age is 19. Since Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than Neil, Mrs. Martin's current age is 19 + 27 = 46.

Answer: {Neil is 19, Mrs. Martin is 46}"
1400,"In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The vertex angle is twice either base angle. What are the angles of the triangle?","Let's denote the base angle as x. 
Since the vertex angle is twice the base angle, the vertex angle is 2x. 
In a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. 
So, we can write the equation: x + x + 2x = 180. 
This simplifies to 4x = 180. 
Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 45. 
So, the base angles are 45 degrees each, and the vertex angle is 2x = 90 degrees.

Answer: {45, 45, 90}"
1401,"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?","Let's denote the number of marbles the first boy has as x and the second boy has as y. We know that x + y = 480.

The first boy arranges his marbles in heaps of 6, so the number of heaps he has is x / 6.

The second boy arranges his marbles in heaps of 9, so the number of heaps he has is y / 9.

We know that the total number of heaps is 72, so we can write the equation:

x / 6 + y / 9 = 72

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 18 (which is the least common multiple of 6 and 9):

3x + 2y = 1296

Now we have two equations:

x + y = 480
3x + 2y = 1296

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2x + 2y = 960
3x + 2y = 1296

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

x = 336

Now we can find y by substituting x into one of the original equations:

y = 480 - x
y = 480 - 336
y = 144

So the first boy has 336 marbles and the second boy has 144 marbles.

Answer: {336, 144}"
1403,"The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. After 5 years, sum of their ages would be 70 years. Find their present ages.","Let's denote Jacob's current age as J and his father's current age as F.

Since the father's age is three times that of Jacob, we can write:
F = 3J

After 5 years, their ages will be J + 5 and F + 5. According to the problem, the sum of their ages after 5 years will be 70:
(J + 5) + (F + 5) = 70

Substituting F = 3J into the equation:
(J + 5) + (3J + 5) = 70

Combine like terms:
4J + 10 = 70

Subtract 10 from both sides:
4J = 60

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 15

Now that we know Jacob's age, we can find his father's age:
F = 3J
F = 3(15)
F = 45

So, Jacob's current age is 15 and his father's current age is 45.

1404,"Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.","Let's denote the width of the rectangle as 'w'. 
Since the length is 8 m less than twice the width, the length can be expressed as 2w - 8.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).
We are given that the perimeter is 56 m, so we can set up the equation:
56 = 2(length + width)
Substituting the expressions for length and width, we get:
56 = 2((2w - 8) + w)
Combine like terms:
56 = 2(3w - 8)
Distribute the 2:
56 = 6w - 16
Add 16 to both sides:
72 = 6w
Divide both sides by 6:
12 = w

Now that we have the width, we can find the length:
length = 2w - 8
Substitute w = 12:
length = 2(12) - 8
length = 24 - 8
length = 16

So, the width is 12 m and the length is 16 m.

Answer: {Length = 16, Width = 12}"
1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","Let's denote Jacob's current age as J and his son's current age as S.

Five years ago, Jacob's age was J - 5 and his son's age was S - 5. According to the problem, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son five years ago. This can be expressed as:

J - 5 = 7(S - 5)

Expanding the equation:

J - 5 = 7S - 35

Adding 5 to both sides:

J = 7S - 30

Now, let's consider the situation five years from now. Jacob's age will be J + 5 and his son's age will be S + 5. According to the problem, Jacob's age will be three times that of his son five years from now. This can be expressed as:

J + 5 = 3(S + 5)

Expanding the equation:

J + 5 = 3S + 15

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

J = 3S + 10

Now we have two equations:

J = 7S - 30
J = 3S + 10

Since both equations are equal to J, we can set them equal to each other:

7S - 30 = 3S + 10

Adding 30 to both sides:

7S = 3S + 40

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

4S = 40

Dividing both sides by 4:

S = 10

Now that we know S, we can find J by substituting S into one of the equations:

J = 7S - 30
J = 7(10) - 30
J = 70 - 30
J = 40

So, Jacob's current age is 40 and his son's current age is 10.

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Let's denote my current age as ""M"" and my son's current age as ""S"".

Five years ago, I was M - 5 years old, and my son was S - 5 years old. According to the problem, five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son. This can be expressed as:

M - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Expanding the equation:

M - 5 = 3S - 15

Adding 5 to both sides:

M = 3S - 10

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem: ten years later, I shall be twice as old as my son. Ten years later, I will be M + 10 years old, and my son will be S + 10 years old. This can be expressed as:

M + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Expanding the equation:

M + 10 = 2S + 20

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

M = 2S + 10

Now we have two equations:

M = 3S - 10
M = 2S + 10

Since both equations are equal to M, we can set them equal to each other:

3S - 10 = 2S + 10

Adding 10 to both sides:

3S = 2S + 20

Subtracting 2S from both sides:

S = 20

Now that we know my son's current age, we can find my current age by substituting S into one of the earlier equations:

M = 3S - 10
M = 3(20) - 10
M = 60 - 10
M = 50

So, I am currently 50 years old, and my son is currently 20 years old.

1408,A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,"Let's denote the age of A as 'a', the age of B as 'b', the age of C as 'c', and the age of D as 'd'.

Since A is two years older than B, we can write:
a = b + 2

Since A's father D is twice as old as A, we can write:
d = 2a

Since B is twice as old as his sister C, we can write:
b = 2c

The ages of D and C differ by 40 years, so we can write:
d - c = 40

Now we can substitute the expressions we have derived into the last equation:
2a - c = 40

We also know that b = 2c and a = b + 2. Substituting these into the equation 2a - c = 40, we get:
2(b + 2) - c = 40
2b + 4 - c = 40
2(2c) + 4 - c = 40 (since b = 2c)
4c + 4 - c = 40
3c + 4 = 40
3c = 36
c = 12

Now we know that c = 12. Since b = 2c, we can find b:
b = 2c
b = 2 * 12
b = 24

And since a = b + 2, we can find a:
a = b + 2
a = 24 + 2
a = 26

The answer is {26, 24}."
1409,"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son. Find the present ages of father and son.","Let's denote the son's age two years ago as x. 
Since the father was five times as old as his son two years ago, the father's age two years ago was 5x.

Now, we need to consider their current ages and their ages two years from now. 
The son's current age is x + 2, and two years from now, his age will be x + 4.
The father's current age is 5x + 2, and two years from now, his age will be 5x + 4.

According to the problem, two years from now, the father's age will be 8 more than the son's age. 
We can write this as an equation: 5x + 4 = x + 4 + 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
5x + 4 = x + 12
Subtract x from both sides: 
4x + 4 = 12
Subtract 4 from both sides: 
4x = 8
Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 2

Now that we know the son's age two years ago was 2, we can find their current ages. 
The son's current age is x + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.
The father's current age is 5x + 2 = 5(2) + 2 = 12.

1410,Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the age of father.,"Let's denote the current age of the father as F, and the current ages of the two children as C1 and C2.

Since the father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children, we can write the equation:
F = 3(C1 + C2)

After 5 years, the father's age will be F + 5, and the sum of the ages of the two children will be (C1 + 5) + (C2 + 5) = C1 + C2 + 10.

According to the problem, after 5 years, the father's age will be twice the sum of the ages of the two children, so we can write the equation:
F + 5 = 2(C1 + C2 + 10)

Now we can substitute the expression for F from the first equation into the second equation:
3(C1 + C2) + 5 = 2(C1 + C2 + 10)

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
3C1 + 3C2 + 5 = 2C1 + 2C2 + 20

Subtracting 2C1 + 2C2 from both sides gives:
C1 + C2 + 5 = 20

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
C1 + C2 = 15

Now we can substitute this expression back into the first equation to find the father's age:
F = 3(C1 + C2)
F = 3(15)
F = 45

1411,5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.,"Let's denote the present age of the father as F and the present age of the son as S.

Five years earlier, the father's age was F - 5 and the son's age was S - 5. According to the problem, the father's age was 7 times the son's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:

F - 5 = 7(S - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

F - 5 = 7S - 35

Adding 5 to both sides, we get:

F = 7S - 30

Now, let's consider the situation 5 years from now. The father's age will be F + 5 and the son's age will be S + 5. According to the problem, the father's age will be 3 times the son's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:

F + 5 = 3(S + 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

F + 5 = 3S + 15

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

F = 3S + 10

Now we have two equations:

F = 7S - 30
F = 3S + 10

Since both equations are equal to F, we can set them equal to each other:

7S - 30 = 3S + 10

Adding 30 to both sides, we get:

7S = 3S + 40

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:

4S = 40

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

S = 10

Now that we have found the son's age, we can find the father's age by substituting S into one of the earlier equations. Let's use the equation F = 7S - 30:

F = 7(10) - 30
F = 70 - 30
F = 40

Find the age of the father.,"Let's denote the current age of the father as F and the sum of the current ages of the children as C. Since the age of the father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children, we can write:

F = C

After 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be C + 5 * 15 (since there are 5 children and each will age 15 years), and the age of the father will be F + 15.

According to the problem, after 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. We can write this as:

C + 5 * 15 = 2 * (F + 15)

Substituting F = C into this equation, we get:

C + 75 = 2 * (C + 15)

Expanding the right side, we get:

C + 75 = 2C + 30

Subtracting C from both sides gives:

75 = C + 30

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives:

45 = C

Since F = C, we have:

F = 45

So, the current age of the father is 45.

1413,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.","Let's denote the present age of the father as F, the present age of the older son as S1, and the present age of the younger son as S2.

We know that one son is two years older than the other, so we can write an equation:
S1 = S2 + 2

We also know that the sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age:
S1 + S2 = F - 14

Now, let's consider the situation ten years ago. The sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. If we subtract 10 from their present ages, we get their ages ten years ago:
(S1 - 10) + (S2 - 10) = (1/3)(F - 10)

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can start by substituting S1 from the first equation into the second equation:
(S2 + 2) + S2 = F - 14
Combine like terms:
2S2 + 2 = F - 14
Subtract 2 from both sides:
2S2 = F - 16

Now, substitute S1 from the first equation into the third equation:
((S2 + 2) - 10) + (S2 - 10) = (1/3)(F - 10)
Simplify the equation:
S2 - 8 + S2 - 10 = (1/3)(F - 10)
Combine like terms:
2S2 - 18 = (1/3)(F - 10)
Add 18 to both sides:
2S2 = (1/3)(F - 10) + 18

Now we have two equations with 2S2:
2S2 = F - 16
2S2 = (1/3)(F - 10) + 18

Set these two equations equal to each other:
F - 16 = (1/3)(F - 10) + 18
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3F - 48 = F - 10 + 54
Combine like terms:
3F - 48 = F + 44
Subtract F from both sides:
2F - 48 = 44
Add 48 to both sides:
2F = 92
Divide both sides by 2:
F = 46

Now that we know the father's age, we can find the sons' ages. Substitute F into one of the earlier equations:
2S2 = F - 16
2S2 = 46 - 16
2S2 = 30
Divide both sides by 2:
S2 = 15

Now that we know the younger son's age, we can find the older son's age:
S1 = S2 + 2
S1 = 15 + 2
S1 = 17

Answer: { Father: 46, Older Son: 17, Younger Son: 15 }"

From the first statement, we know that twice the son's age added to the father's age equals 70. This can be written as:
2S + F = 70

From the second statement, we know that twice the father's age added to the son's age equals 95. This can be written as:
2F + S = 95

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of S in both equations equal:
4F + 2S = 190

Now we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate S:
(4F + 2S) - (2S + F) = 190 - 70
This simplifies to:
3F = 120

Now we can solve for F:
F = 120 / 3
F = 40

Now that we know the father's age, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the son's age. Let's use the first equation:
2S + F = 70
2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:
S = 15

Five years later, my age will be M + 5 and my son's age will be S + 5. According to the problem, five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. We can write this as:
M + 5 = 2.5(S + 5)

Now we have two equations:
1) M = 3S
2) M + 5 = 2.5(S + 5)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
3S + 5 = 2.5(S + 5)

Expanding the equation:
3S + 5 = 2.5S + 12.5

Now, let's isolate S by moving the terms involving S to one side:
3S - 2.5S = 12.5 - 5
0.5S = 7.5

Now, let's solve for S:
S = 7.5 / 0.5
S = 15

Now that we know my son's age, we can find my age using the first equation:
M = 3S
M = 3 * 15
M = 45

So, I am 45 years old and my son is 15 years old.

We are given that the sum of their present ages is 55 years:
F + S = 55

We are also given that if the father lives until his son's age equals his present age, the total of their ages would be 93 years. This means that the son's age at that time would be F (since it would be equal to the father's present age), and the father's age at that time would be F + (F - S) (since he would have lived for the additional number of years it takes for his son to reach his present age).

The total of their ages at that time would be:
F + (F - S) + F = 93

Combine like terms:
2F + (F - S) = 93
3F - S = 93

Now we have two equations:
F + S = 55
3F - S = 93

We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations to eliminate S:
(F + S) + (3F - S) = 55 + 93
4F = 148

Divide by 4:
F = 37

Now that we have the father's present age, we can find the son's present age by substituting F into one of the original equations:

We also know that Denver is twice as old as Anna:
D = 2A

Ben is twice as old as Cathy:
B = 2C

The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years:
D - C = 30

Now we can substitute the expressions we have derived into the last equation:
2A - C = 30

We also know that B = 2C and B = A + 3. Combining these two equations, we get:
A + 3 = 2C
A = 2C - 3

Five years ago, Nancy was N - 5 years old, and Sam was S - 5 years old. According to the problem, five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. This can be expressed as:

N - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Expanding the equation:

N - 5 = 3S - 15

Adding 5 to both sides:

N = 3S - 10

Now, let's consider the situation ten years later. Nancy will be N + 10 years old, and Sam will be S + 10 years old. According to the problem, ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. This can be expressed as:

N + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Expanding the equation:

N + 10 = 2S + 20

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

N = 2S + 10

Now we have two equations:

N = 3S - 10
N = 2S + 10

Equating the two expressions for N:

3S - 10 = 2S + 10

Adding 10 to both sides:

3S = 2S + 20

Subtracting 2S from both sides:

S = 20

Now that we know Sam's current age, we can find Nancy's current age by substituting S into one of the equations:

N = 3S - 10
N = 3(20) - 10
N = 60 - 10
N = 50

So, Nancy is currently 50 years old, and Sam is currently 20 years old.

Answer: {Nancy is 50, Sam is 20}"
1419,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.,"Let's denote the two-digit number as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.

Since the sum of the digits is 3, we can write an equation:
x + y = 3

We are also given that seven times the two-digit number is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits. Reversing the order of digits means swapping x and y, so the reversed number is 10y + x.

We can write an equation based on this information:
7(10x + y) = 4(10y + x)

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
70x + 7y = 40y + 4x

Subtracting 4x from both sides and subtracting 7y from both sides gives us:
66x = 33y

Dividing both sides by 33 gives us:
2x = y

Now we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:
x + 2x = 3

Combine like terms:
3x = 3

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find y:
y = 2x
y = 2(1)
y = 2

So the two-digit number is 10x + y = 10(1) + 2 = 12.

1420,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.,"Let's denote the two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.

According to the problem, the number is four times the sum of its digits. This can be written as:
10a + b = 4(a + b)

Also, the number is twice the product of the digits. This can be written as:
10a + b = 2ab

We can simplify the first equation:
10a + b = 4a + 4b
6a = 3b
2a = b

Now, we can substitute b = 2a into the second equation:
10a + 2a = 2a * 2a
12a = 4a^2
4a^2 - 12a = 0
a(4a - 12) = 0
a(4(a - 3)) = 0
a = 0 or a = 3

Since 'a' is the tens digit, it cannot be 0. Therefore, a = 3.

Now, we can find 'b':
b = 2a
b = 2 * 3
b = 6

So, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10 * 3 + 6 = 36.

Answer: {36}"
1421,"A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.","Let's denote the tens digit of the number as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'. The number itself can be represented as 10a + b.

According to the problem, the number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. This can be written as:

10a + b = 7(a + b)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10a + b = 7a + 7b

Subtracting 7a from both sides and subtracting b from both sides gives:

3a = 6b

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

a = 2b

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. This means:

10a + b - 27 = 10b + a

Rearranging the equation, we get:

9a - 9b = 27

Dividing both sides by 9 gives:

a - b = 3

Now we have two equations:

a = 2b
a - b = 3

Substituting a = 2b into the second equation, we get:

2b - b = 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

b = 3

Now that we know b, we can find a:

a = 2b
a = 2 * 3
a = 6

So, the number is 10a + b = 10 * 6 + 3 = 63.

Answer: {63}"
1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.","Let's denote the original two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.

Given that the sum of the two digits is 9, we can write the equation:
a + b = 9

When the digits are reversed, the new number becomes 10b + a. According to the problem, this new number is 9 more than the original number. So, we can write the equation:
10b + a = (10a + b) + 9

Simplifying the equation, we get:
10b + a = 10a + b + 9
10b - b = 10a - a + 9
9b = 9a + 9
9b - 9a = 9
9(b - a) = 9
b - a = 1

Now we have two equations:
a + b = 9
b - a = 1

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Adding the two equations, we get:
2b = 10
b = 5

Substituting b = 5 into the first equation, we get:
a + 5 = 9
a = 4

So, the original number is 10a + b = 10(4) + 5 = 45.

1423,The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.,"Let's denote the original two-digit number as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.

Given that the sum of the digits is 15, we can write the equation:
x + y = 15

Now, let's consider what happens when the number is decreased by 27 and the digits are reversed. The new number can be represented as 10y + x.

We know that the original number minus 27 equals the new number with the digits reversed:
10x + y - 27 = 10y + x

Rearrange the equation to isolate the variables:
10x - x + y - 10y = 27
9x - 9y = 27

Divide both sides by 9:
x - y = 3

Now we have two equations:
x + y = 15
x - y = 3

Add the two equations to eliminate y:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, substitute it into one of the original equations to find y:
9 + y = 15
y = 6

So, the original number is 10x + y = 10(9) + 6 = 96.

Answer: {96}"
1424,"In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number.","Let's denote the unit digit as x. Since the tens digit is three times the unit digit, the tens digit is 3x.

The original number can be written as 10(3x) + x = 30x + x = 31x.

When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. This means the new number is 10x + 3x = 13x.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

31x - 54 = 13x

Subtract 13x from both sides:

18x - 54 = 0

Add 54 to both sides:

18x = 54

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 3

Now that we know the unit digit is 3, the tens digit is 3x = 3(3) = 9.

The original number is 93.

1425,The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 8 and the difference between the number and that formed by reversing the digits is 18. Find the number.,"Let's denote the tens digit of the original number as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'. Since it's a two-digit number, we know that a is not 0.

Given that the sum of the digits is 8, we can write the equation:
a + b = 8

When we reverse the digits, the new number becomes 10b + a. The difference between the original number (10a + b) and the reversed number is given as 18. So, we can write another equation:
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 18
Simplifying this, we get:
9a - 9b = 18
Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:
a - b = 2

Now we have two equations:
1. a + b = 8
2. a - b = 2

Adding these two equations together to eliminate b, we get:
2a = 10
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
a = 5

Now that we know a, we can find b using the first equation:
5 + b = 8
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:
b = 3

So, the original number is 10a + b = 10*5 + 3 = 53.

1426,"A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.","To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of relative speed. Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as 'b' and the speed of the stream as 's'. 

When the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is reduced by the speed of the stream, so the speed upstream is 'b - s'. When the boat goes downstream, its effective speed is increased by the speed of the stream, so the speed downstream is 'b + s'.

We are given two scenarios:

1. The boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours.
2. The boat goes 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream in 13 hours.

We can set up the following equations based on the formula: distance = speed * time.

For the first scenario:
30 / (b - s) + 44 / (b + s) = 10  ... (Equation 1)

For the second scenario:
40 / (b - s) + 55 / (b + s) = 13  ... (Equation 2)

To simplify the equations, let's multiply both sides of Equation 1 by (b - s)(b + s) and both sides of Equation 2 by (b - s)(b + s). This will eliminate the fractions.

Equation 1 becomes:
30(b + s) + 44(b - s) = 10(b^2 - s^2)
Expanding and simplifying:
74b - 14s = 10b^2 - 10s^2  ... (Equation 3)

Equation 2 becomes:
40(b + s) + 55(b - s) = 13(b^2 - s^2)
Expanding and simplifying:
95b - 15s = 13b^2 - 13s^2  ... (Equation 4)

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously.

First, let's multiply Equation 3 by 13 and Equation 4 by 10 to make the coefficients of b^2 and s^2 equal:
962b - 182s = 130b^2 - 130s^2  ... (Equation 5)
950b - 150s = 130b^2 - 130s^2  ... (Equation 6)

Now, subtract Equation 6 from Equation 5:
12b - 32s = 0
Divide by 4:
3b - 8s = 0
Now, express b in terms of s:
b = 8s / 3

Now, substitute this expression for b into Equation 3:
74(8s / 3) - 14s = 10(8s / 3)^2 - 10s^2
Expanding and simplifying:
(592/3)s - 14s = (640/9)s^2 - 10s^2
Combine like terms:
(592/3 - 14)s = (640/9 - 90/9)s^2
(592 - 42)/3 = (640 - 90)/9 * s
550/3 = 550/9 * s
Multiply both sides by 9/550:
s = 3

Now that we have the speed of the stream, we can find the speed of the boat in still water:
b = 8s / 3
b = 8 * 3 / 3
b = 8

1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.","To find Tara's speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current, we need to use the concept of relative speed.

When Tara rows downstream, her speed is the sum of her speed in still water and the speed of the current. Let's denote her speed in still water as 's' and the speed of the current as 'c'. Then, her downstream speed is s + c.

We know that she can row 20 km downstream in 2 hours, so her downstream speed is:

Downstream speed = Distance / Time = 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/h

Now, we can write an equation based on this:

s + c = 10 ... (Equation 1)

When Tara rows upstream, her speed is the difference between her speed in still water and the speed of the current. So, her upstream speed is s - c.

We know that she can row 4 km upstream in 2 hours, so her upstream speed is:

Upstream speed = Distance / Time = 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/h

Now, we can write another equation based on this:

s - c = 2 ... (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously.

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2, we get:

2s = 12

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 6

Now, substituting s = 6 into Equation 1, we get:

6 + c = 10

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

c = 4

So, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/h, and the speed of the current is 4 km/h.

1428,A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current.

Let's denote the speed of the sailor in still water as 's' and the speed of the current as 'c'.

When the sailor goes downstream, the speed of the sailor is the sum of the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current. So, the speed downstream is (s + c).

When the sailor goes upstream, the speed of the sailor is the difference between the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current. So, the speed upstream is (s - c).

We are given that the sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour.

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 40 minutes is equal to 40/60 = 2/3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the speed downstream:

Speed downstream = Distance / Time = 8 km / (2/3) hours = 8 * (3/2) km/h = 12 km/h

So, (s + c) = 12 km/h.

Now, we can calculate the speed upstream:

Speed upstream = Distance / Time = 8 km / 1 hour = 8 km/h

So, (s - c) = 8 km/h.

Now we have two equations:

(s + c) = 12 km/h
(s - c) = 8 km/h

We can add these two equations to eliminate 'c':

2s = 20 km/h

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 's':

s = 10 km/h

Now that we have 's', we can find 'c' by substituting 's' into one of the original equations:

(10 + c) = 12 km/h

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

c = 2 km/h

So, the speed of the sailor in still water is 10 km/h and the speed of the current is 2 km/h.

1429,"Points A and B are 70 km apart on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B at the same time. If they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours, but if they travel towards each other they meet in one hour. What are their respective speeds?","Let's denote the speed of the car starting from point A as 'x' km/h and the speed of the car starting from point B as 'y' km/h.

When they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours. This means that the distance covered by the car starting from point A plus the distance covered by the car starting from point B equals the distance between points A and B, which is 70 km. However, since they are traveling in the same direction, the car starting from point B would have covered the distance between the meeting point and point B, while the car starting from point A would have covered the distance between point A and the meeting point. So, the equation becomes:

7x - 7y = 70

When they travel towards each other, they meet in 1 hour. In this case, the sum of the distances covered by both cars equals the distance between points A and B, which is 70 km. So, the equation becomes:

x + y = 70

Now we have two equations:

7x - 7y = 70
x + y = 70

We can simplify the first equation by dividing both sides by 7:

x - y = 10

Now we have two equations:

x - y = 10
x + y = 70

We can add these two equations to eliminate y:

2x = 80

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find y. Let's use the equation x + y = 70:

40 + y = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

y = 30

So, the speed of the car starting from point A is 40 km/h, and the speed of the car starting from point B is 30 km/h.

1430,"Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.","To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations using the formula distance = speed * time. 

Let's denote the speed of the train as 't' and the speed of the taxi as 'x'. 

In the first scenario, Amy travels 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, taking a total of 5 hours 30 minutes. We can convert the time to just hours by converting the 30 minutes to 0.5 hours. So the total time is 5.5 hours.

We can set up the equation: 
300/t + 200/x = 5.5 

In the second scenario, Amy travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi, taking a total of 5 hours 36 minutes. We can convert the time to just hours by converting the 36 minutes to 0.6 hours. So the total time is 5.6 hours.

We can set up the equation: 
260/t + 240/x = 5.6 

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 't' and 'x' by solving these equations simultaneously.

First, we multiply both sides of the first equation by tx to get rid of the fractions:
300x + 200t = 5.5tx

Then we multiply both sides of the second equation by tx to get rid of the fractions:
260x + 240t = 5.6tx

Now we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate tx:
(300x - 260x) + (200t - 240t) = (5.5tx - 5.6tx)
40x - 40t = -0.1tx

Now we can divide both sides by -0.1t to get:
400x/t - 400 = x

Now we can substitute x in one of the original equations to solve for t. We'll use the first equation:
300/t + 200/(400 - 400t/t) = 5.5 

Now we can simplify the equation:
300/t + 200/(400 - 400) = 5.5 
300/t + 200/(-400/t) = 5.5 
300/t - t/2 = 5.5 

Now we can multiply both sides by 2t to get rid of the fractions:
600 - t^2 = 11t 

Now we can rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:
t^2 + 11t - 600 = 0 

Now we can factor the quadratic equation:
(t + 25)(t - 24) = 0 

Now we can solve for t:
t = -25 or t = 24 

Since speed cannot be negative, we can discard the negative solution. So the speed of the train is 24 km/h.

Now we can substitute t in one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:
300/24 + 200/x = 5.5 

Now we can simplify the equation:
12.5 + 200/x = 5.5 

Now we can subtract 12.5 from both sides:
200/x = -7 

Now we can multiply both sides by x to get rid of the fraction:
200 = -7x 

Now we can divide both sides by -7:
x = -200/7 

Since speed cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. We made an error somewhere in our calculations.

Let's go back to the equation:
400x/t - 400 = x 

Now we can add 400 to both sides:
400x/t = x + 400 

Now we can multiply both sides by t to get rid of the fraction:
400x = tx + 400t 

Now we can subtract tx from both sides:
400x - tx = 400t 

Now we can factor out x:
x(400 - t) = 400t 

Now we can divide both sides by (400 - t):
x = 400t/(400 - t) 

Now we can substitute x in one of the original equations to solve for t. We'll use the first equation:
300/t + 200/(400t/(400 - t)) = 5.5 

Now we can simplify the equation:
300/t + (200(400 - t))/(400t) = 5.5 
300/t + (80000 - 200t)/(400t) = 5.5 

Now we can multiply both sides by 400t to get rid of the fractions:
120000 + 80000 - 200t = 2200t 

Now we can combine like terms:
200000 = 2400t 

Now we can divide both sides by 2400:
t = 200000/2400 
t = 83.33 

Now we can substitute t in the equation for x:
x = 400t/("

F + R = 216

Now, let's consider the cost of one full and one half reserved first class tickets, which is $327. The half ticket costs half the basic fare (F/2) and the same reservation charge (R). The full ticket costs the basic fare (F) and the reservation charge (R). So, we can write:

F + R + F/2 + R = 327

Combine like terms:

1.5F + 2R = 327

Now we have two equations:

F + R = 216
1.5F + 2R = 327

We can solve these equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2(F + R) = 2(216)
2F + 2R = 432

Now subtract this equation from the second equation:

(1.5F + 2R) - (2F + 2R) = 327 - 432
-0.5F = -105

Now divide by -0.5:

F = 210

Now that we have the basic fare (F), we can find the reservation charge (R) by substituting F into one of the original equations:

F + R = 216
210 + R = 216

Subtract 210 from both sides:

R = 6

Answer: {F = 210, R = 6}"
1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let's denote the original speed of the man as 's' km/hr and the distance covered as 'd' km.

When the man walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his speed becomes (s + 1/2) km/hr. Since he takes 1 hour less, the time taken at this speed is (d / (s + 1/2)) = (d / s) - 1.

When the man walks 1 km/hr slower, his speed becomes (s - 1) km/hr. Since he takes 3 hours more, the time taken at this speed is (d / (s - 1)) = (d / s) + 3.

We can set up two equations using the above information:

d / s - d / (s + 1/2) = 1 ... (1)
d / (s - 1) - d / s = 3 ... (2)

Simplifying equation (1), we get:
d / s - 2d / (2s + 1) = 1
(2s + 1)d / s(2s + 1) - 2sd / s(2s + 1) = 1
d(2s + 1 - 2s) / s(2s + 1) = 1
d / s(2s + 1) = 1
d = s(2s + 1) ... (3)

Simplifying equation (2), we get:
d / (s - 1) - d / s = 3
ds / s(s - 1) - d(s - 1) / s(s - 1) = 3
d(s - (s - 1)) / s(s - 1) = 3
d / s(s - 1) = 3
d = 3s(s - 1) ... (4)

Equating equations (3) and (4), we get:
s(2s + 1) = 3s(s - 1)
2s^2 + s = 3s^2 - 3s
s^2 - 4s = 0
s(s - 4) = 0
s = 0 or s = 4

Since the speed cannot be 0, the original speed of the man is 4 km/hr.

Substituting s = 4 in equation (3), we get:
d = 4(2*4 + 1)
d = 4(9)
d = 36

So, the distance covered by the man is 36 km and his original rate of walking is 4 km/hr.

Answer: {36, 4}"
1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"Let's denote the time the car went uphill as 'u' hours and the time it went downhill as 'd' hours. 

Since the total time is 15 hours, we can write the equation:
u + d = 15

We also know that the distance covered uphill is 30u km and the distance covered downhill is 50d km. The total distance covered is 650 km, so we can write the equation:
30u + 50d = 650

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'u' and 'd'.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 30 to get:
30u + 30d = 450

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:
20d = 200

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:
d = 10

Now we can substitute 'd' into the first equation to get:
u + 10 = 15
u = 5

So the car went uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

1436,"Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the speed of the train as T km/h and the speed of the bus as B km/h.

In the first scenario, Ronnie travels 60 km by train and the remaining 240 km by bus. The total time taken is 4 hours.

We can set up the equation:

60/T + 240/B = 4

In the second scenario, Ronnie travels 100 km by train and the remaining 200 km by bus. The total time taken is 4 hours 10 minutes, which is equal to 4.17 hours (converting 10 minutes to hours).

We can set up the equation:

100/T + 200/B = 4.17

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for T and B.

First, let's multiply both equations by T and B to eliminate the fractions:

60B + 240T = 4TB
100B + 200T = 4.17TB

Now we can multiply the first equation by 100 and the second equation by 60 to make the coefficients of B equal:

6000B + 24000T = 400TB
6000B + 12000T = 250.2TB

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

12000T = 149.8TB

Dividing both sides by 149.8T, we get:

80 = B

Now that we have found B, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find T. Let's use the first equation:

60/T + 240/80 = 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

60/T + 3 = 4

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:

60/T = 1

Multiplying both sides by T, we get:

60 = T

So, the speed of the train is 60 km/h and the speed of the bus is 80 km/h.

Answer: {60, 80}"
1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","Let's denote the original speed of the train as 's' km/hr and the scheduled time as 't' hours. The distance covered by the train is then 'd' = s * t.

If the train were 6 km/hr faster, its speed would be (s + 6) km/hr. Since it takes 8 hours less than the scheduled time, the time taken would be (t - 8) hours. The distance covered remains the same, so we can set up the equation:

d = s * t = (s + 6) * (t - 8)

Expanding the equation, we get:

s * t = s * t - 8s + 6t - 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8s - 6t = -48

Now, if the train were slower by 6 km/hr, its speed would be (s - 6) km/hr. Since it takes 12 hours more than the scheduled time, the time taken would be (t + 12) hours. Again, the distance covered remains the same, so we can set up the equation:

d = s * t = (s - 6) * (t + 12)

Expanding the equation, we get:

s * t = s * t + 12s - 6t - 72

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-12s + 6t = -72

Now we have two equations:

8s - 6t = -48
-12s + 6t = -72

We can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 't' equal:

24s - 18t = -144
-24s + 12t = -144

Now, adding the two equations, we get:

-6t = -288

Dividing by -6, we get:

t = 48

Now that we have the value of 't', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 's'. Let's use the first equation:

8s - 6t = -48
8s - 6(48) = -48
8s - 288 = -48
8s = 240
s = 30

Now that we have the values of 's' and 't', we can find the distance 'd':

d = s * t
= 30 * 48
= 1440

1439,"The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.","Let's denote the cost of each bat as B and the cost of each ball as L.

From the first purchase, we know that 7 bats and 6 balls cost $3800. This can be written as an equation:

7B + 6L = 3800

From the second purchase, we know that 3 bats and 5 balls cost $1750. This can be written as another equation:

3B + 5L = 1750

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, we'll multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of L's in both equations are the same:

 Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 6:

35B + 30L = 19000
18B + 30L = 10500

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate L:

(35B - 18B) + (30L - 30L) = 19000 - 10500
17B = 8500

Now, divide by 17 to find the cost of each bat:

B = 8500 / 17
B = 500

Now that we know the cost of each bat, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the cost of each ball. Let's use the first equation:

7B + 6L = 3800
7(500) + 6L = 3800
3500 + 6L = 3800

Subtract 3500 from both sides:

6L = 300

Divide by 6:

L = 300 / 6
L = 50

So, the cost of each bat is $500 and the cost of each ball is $50.

1441,"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.","Let's denote the two-digit number as 10x + y, where x is the digit in the tens place and y is the digit in the ones place.

Given that the sum of the digits is 9, we can write the equation:
x + y = 9

We are also given that nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. The number obtained by reversing the order of the digits is 10y + x. So, we can write the equation:
9(10x + y) = 2(10y + x)

Expanding the equation, we get:
90x + 9y = 20y + 2x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
90x - 2x = 20y - 9y
88x = 11y

Dividing both sides by 11, we get:
8x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:
x + 8x = 9
9x = 9

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
x = 1

Now that we have found x, we can find y:
y = 8x
y = 8(1)
y = 8

So, the two-digit number is 10x + y = 10(1) + 8 = 18.

1444,"A person invested some amount at 12% simple interest and some amount at 10% simple interest. He received an annual interest of $130. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?","Let's denote the amount invested at 12% as x and the amount invested at 10% as y.

The annual interest from the 12% investment is 0.12x.
The annual interest from the 10% investment is 0.10y.

The total interest received is $130, so we can write the equation:
0.12x + 0.10y = 130

Now, let's consider the scenario where the person interchanged the investments. In this case, the amount invested at 12% would be y, and the amount invested at 10% would be x.

The annual interest from the 12% investment would be 0.12y.
The annual interest from the 10% investment would be 0.10x.

The total interest received in this scenario is $4 more than the original scenario, so we can write the equation:
0.12y + 0.10x = 130 + 4
0.12y + 0.10x = 134

Now we have two equations:
0.12x + 0.10y = 130
0.10x + 0.12y = 134

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 0.10 and the second equation by 0.12, and then subtracting the first equation from the second equation.

0.012x + 0.010y = 13
0.012x + 0.0144y = 16.08

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
0.0044y = 3.08
y = 700

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find x.
0.12x + 0.10(700) = 130
0.12x + 70 = 130
0.12x = 60
x = 500

So, the person invested $500 at 12% and $700 at 10%.

According to the problem, after 12 years, the father's age will be twice the age of his son. 
This can be expressed as the equation: 3x + 12 = 2(x + 12).

Now, let's solve this equation:
3x + 12 = 2x + 24
3x - 2x = 24 - 12
x = 12

Let's denote the smaller angle as x. Since the larger angle exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees, the larger angle can be represented as x + 18.

We know that the sum of the two angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 180

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 180

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 162

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 81

Now that we know the smaller angle is 81 degrees, we can find the larger angle by adding 18:

The original area of the rectangle is L * B.

When the length is reduced by 5 units and the breadth is increased by 3 units, the new area is (L - 5) * (B + 3). We are told that this new area is 9 square units less than the original area. So, we can write the equation:

L * B - (L - 5) * (B + 3) = 9

Expanding the equation, we get:

L * B - L * B - 3L + 5B + 15 = 9

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Now, let's consider the second scenario. When the length is increased by 3 units and the breadth is increased by 2 units, the new area is (L + 3) * (B + 2). We are told that this new area is 67 square units more than the original area. So, we can write the equation:

(L + 3) * (B + 2) - L * B = 67

Expanding the equation, we get:

L * B + 2L + 3B + 6 - L * B = 67

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2L + 3B = 61

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for L and B using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. 

Let's call the first angle x. 
Since two angles are the same size, the second angle is also x. 
The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so it is x - 12.

Now we can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles:
x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:
3x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:
3x = 192

Divide by 3:
x = 64

Now that we know the first angle is 64 degrees, we can find the other two angles.
The second angle is also 64 degrees.
The third angle is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

So, the angles are 64, 64, and 52 degrees.

1471,The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?,"Let's denote the measure of the first angle as x.

Since the second angle is five times as large as the first, the measure of the second angle is 5x.

The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle, so the measure of the third angle is x + 12.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 5x + (x + 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 180

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 24

Now that we know the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the second and third angles:

The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first, so its measure is 2x - 12.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

6x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

6x = 192

Divide by 6:

x = 32

Now that we know the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the other two angles:

The first angle is 32 degrees.

The second angle is 3x = 3(32) = 96 degrees.

The third angle is 2x - 12 = 2(32) - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

1473,The perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width. Find the dimensions.,"To find the dimensions of the rectangle, let's denote the width as 'w' and the length as 'l'. We are given that the length is 15 cm greater than the width, so we can express the length in terms of the width as l = w + 15.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2w + 2l. We are given that the perimeter is 150 cm, so we can set up the equation:

150 = 2w + 2l

Substituting l = w + 15 into the equation, we get:

150 = 2w + 2(w + 15)

Expanding the equation, we get:

150 = 2w + 2w + 30

Combine like terms:

150 = 4w + 30

Subtract 30 from both sides:

120 = 4w

Divide both sides by 4:

30 = w

Now that we have found the width, we can find the length by substituting w into the equation l = w + 15:

Let's denote the width as W and the length as L. We are told that the length is 14 meters more than the width, so we can write an equation based on this relationship:
L = W + 14

The perimeter of a rectangle (such as a basketball court) is given by the formula:
Perimeter = 2W + 2L

We are given that the perimeter is 96 meters, so we can set up an equation using the formula:
96 = 2W + 2L

Now, we can substitute the expression for L (W + 14) into the equation:
96 = 2W + 2(W + 14)

Expanding the equation gives:
96 = 2W + 2W + 28
96 = 4W + 28

Subtracting 28 from both sides gives:
68 = 4W

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
W = 17

Now that we have found the width, we can find the length by substituting W into the equation L = W + 14:
L = 17 + 14
L = 31

Therefore, the dimensions of the college basketball court are a width of 17 meters and a length of 31 meters.

Let's call the length of one side 's'. Then the perimeter is 4s. We know the perimeter is 48 meters, so we can write an equation: 4s = 48. 

To find 's', we divide both sides by 4: s = 48 / 4 = 12. 

So, the length of one side of the garden is 12 meters. 

The area of a square is the length of one side squared. So, the area of the garden is 12 * 12 = 144 square meters. 

The area of the pond is 20 square meters. 

To find the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond, we subtract the area of the pond from the area of the garden: 144 - 20 = 124 square meters.

1502,A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?,"To find the area of the border, we first need to find the area of the entire room and the area of the carpet. 

The area of the entire room is the length times the width, which is 12 * 10 = 120 square feet.

Since the border is 2 feet wide all around, the carpet's length and width will be 12 - 2 - 2 = 8 feet and 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 feet, respectively.

The area of the carpet is 8 * 6 = 48 square feet.

Now, to find the area of the border, we subtract the area of the carpet from the area of the entire room: 120 - 48 = 72 square feet.

The answer is {72}."
1503,A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?,"To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to find its width. 

The perimeter of the square is 4 times its side length, which is 4 * 15 = 60 cm.

Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times its length plus 2 times its width. 

We know the length of the rectangle is 18 cm, so we can write an equation for its perimeter: 
2 * 18 + 2 * width = 60.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
36 + 2 * width = 60.

Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get: 
2 * width = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 
width = 12.

Now that we know the width of the rectangle is 12 cm, we can find its area by multiplying its length and width: 
Area = length * width = 18 * 12 = 216.

The answer is {216}."
1504,"Kevin can mow a square lawn that is 30 meters of each side in 45 minutes. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side?","To find out how long it will take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side, we first need to figure out the area of both lawns.

The area of the first lawn is 30 * 30 = 900 square meters.
The area of the second lawn is 60 * 60 = 3600 square meters.

Since Kevin can mow the first lawn in 45 minutes, we can find out how many square meters he can mow per minute.
This is 900 square meters / 45 minutes = 20 square meters per minute.

Now we can find out how long it will take him to mow the second lawn.
This is 3600 square meters / 20 square meters per minute = 180 minutes.

1506,Chloe agreed to wash all of the windows in Todd's giant art studio. There are 400 square panes of glass each measuring 2.5 feet on each side. Todd offered to pay 10 cents per square foot. Chloe said she would rather get paid 60 cents a pane. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?,"To find out how much money Todd will save, we need to calculate the difference between what he would have paid if he paid 10 cents per square foot and what he will pay by paying 60 cents per pane.

First, let's calculate the total area of the windows in square feet. Since each pane is 2.5 feet on each side, the area of each pane is 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25 square feet. There are 400 panes, so the total area is 400 * 6.25 = 2500 square feet.

If Todd paid 10 cents per square foot, he would have paid 2500 * 0.10 = $250.

Since Todd agreed to pay 60 cents per pane, he will pay 400 * 0.60 = $240.

The difference between what he would have paid and what he will pay is $250 - $240 = $10.

1507,Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?,"To find out how many small pancakes Grandma's recipe will make, we need to compare the area of the large pancakes to the area of the small pancakes.

The area of a circle (such as a pancake) is calculated using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.

The diameter of the large pancakes is 10 inches, so the radius is 10/2 = 5 inches.
The area of a large pancake is A = π(5)^2 = 25π square inches.

The diameter of the small pancakes is 2 inches, so the radius is 2/2 = 1 inch.
The area of a small pancake is A = π(1)^2 = π square inches.

Since Grandma's recipe makes 8 large pancakes, the total area of the pancakes is 8 * 25π = 200π square inches.

To find out how many small pancakes this area will make, we divide the total area by the area of a small pancake:
200π / π = 200.

So, Grandma's recipe will make 200 small pancakes.

1508,Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?,"To find the area of the circle, we first need to find the radius of the circle. Since the circle touches each side of the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.

The area of the square is given as 400 square inches. To find the side length of the square, we take the square root of the area:

Side length of square = √400 = 20 inches

Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, the diameter of the circle is also 20 inches. The radius of the circle is half of the diameter:

Radius of circle = 20 / 2 = 10 inches

Now that we have the radius of the circle, we can find the area of the circle using the formula:

Area of circle = π * (radius)^2
= π * (10)^2
= 3.14 * 100
= 314 square inches

1509,"A piece of square paper has a perimeter of 32 centimeters. Nicky's dog, Rocky, tore off 1/4 of the paper. What is the area of the remaining paper?","To find the area of the remaining paper, we first need to find the side length of the square paper. 

Since the perimeter of the square paper is 32 centimeters, we can find the side length by dividing the perimeter by 4 (since a square has 4 equal sides). 

Side length = Perimeter / 4
Side length = 32 / 4
Side length = 8 centimeters

Now that we know the side length, we can find the area of the original square paper by squaring the side length.

Area = Side length * Side length
Area = 8 * 8
Area = 64 square centimeters

Since Rocky tore off 1/4 of the paper, we need to find 1/4 of the original area and subtract it from the original area to find the area of the remaining paper.

Area torn off = 1/4 * Original area
Area torn off = 1/4 * 64
Area torn off = 16 square centimeters

Area of remaining paper = Original area - Area torn off
Area of remaining paper = 64 - 16
Area of remaining paper = 48 square centimeters

1510,A length of wire is cut into several smaller pieces. Each of the smaller pieces are bent into squares. Each square has a side that measures 2 centimeters. The total area of the smaller squares is 92 square centimeters. What was the original length of wire?,"To find the original length of the wire, we need to find out how many squares were made and then calculate the total perimeter of all the squares.

Each square has a side of 2 centimeters, so the area of one square is 2 * 2 = 4 square centimeters.

The total area of all the squares is 92 square centimeters. To find out how many squares were made, we divide the total area by the area of one square:

92 / 4 = 23

So, 23 squares were made.

The perimeter of one square is 4 times the length of its side, which is 4 * 2 = 8 centimeters.

Since there are 23 squares, the total perimeter of all the squares (which is the total length of the wire) is:

23 * 8 = 184 centimeters

1512,A triangle has a perimeter of 90 cm. The lengths of the three sides are in the ratio 5:12:13. What is the length of the shortest side?,"To find the length of the shortest side, we first need to understand that the ratio of the sides is 5:12:13. 

Let's assume the common factor for the ratio is x. This means the lengths of the three sides are 5x, 12x, and 13x.

Since the perimeter of the triangle is 90 cm, we can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 12x + 13x = 90

Combine like terms:

30x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 30:

x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find the lengths of the three sides:

5x = 5 * 3 = 15 cm
12x = 12 * 3 = 36 cm
13x = 13 * 3 = 39 cm

The shortest side is 15 cm.

1514,The ratio of the length of a rectangle to its width is 6:5. Its length is 24 inches. What is its width?,"To find the width of the rectangle, we need to use the given ratio of length to width, which is 6:5. 

We are given that the length of the rectangle is 24 inches. 

Since the ratio of length to width is 6:5, we can set up a proportion to find the width. 

Let's say the width is 5x. Then, the length is 6x. 

Since the length is 24 inches, we can set up the equation:

6x = 24

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 24 / 6
x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the width by multiplying x by 5:

1547,"Billy had six hundred fifty pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into three bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?","To find out how many pieces of candy Billy needs to make sure each bag has the same amount, we first need to divide the total number of candies he has by 3.

He has 650 pieces of candy.
Divide by 3: 650 / 3 = 216.67.

Since we can't have a fraction of a candy, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to make sure each bag has the same amount. 
So, we round up to 217 candies per bag.

Now, we need to find out how many candies Billy needs in total to have 217 candies in each of the 3 bags.
Multiply the number of bags by the number of candies per bag: 3 * 217 = 651.

Billy has 650 candies, but he needs 651 to make sure each bag has the same amount.
So, he needs 651 - 650 = 1 more candy.

1548,"Megan had five hundred sixteen pennies. She wanted to place the pennies into nine stacks, with the same amount in each stack. How many more pennies would she need so all the stacks would be equal?","To find out how many pennies Megan needs to make equal stacks, we first need to divide the total number of pennies she has by the number of stacks she wants to make.

Megan has 516 pennies and wants to make 9 stacks.

Divide the total number of pennies by the number of stacks: 516 / 9 = 57.33.

Since we can't have a fraction of a penny, we round down to 57 pennies per stack, as that's the closest whole number we can have in each stack with the pennies she has.

Now, we need to find out how many pennies she would need in total to have 9 stacks with the same amount in each stack. 

Multiply the number of stacks by the rounded number of pennies per stack: 9 * 57 = 513.

However, we want to find out how to make the stacks equal with the pennies she has, which is more than 513. So we need to find the next multiple of 9 after 516.

The next multiple of 9 after 516 is 522 (9 * 58 = 522).

Now, subtract the total number of pennies Megan has from the next multiple of 9: 522 - 516 = 6.

So, Megan needs 6 more pennies to make 9 equal stacks.

How many extra pieces of junk mail will they have if they give each truck the same amount?,"To find out how many extra pieces of junk mail the post office will have, we first need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of mail trucks.

There are 582 pieces of junk mail and 7 mail trucks.
If we divide 582 by 7, we get 83.14.
Since we can't divide a piece of mail into fractions, each truck will get 83 pieces of mail.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of mail will be given to the trucks in total.
7 trucks * 83 pieces per truck = 581 pieces.

The post office had 582 pieces of junk mail.
After giving 581 pieces to the trucks, they will have 582 - 581 = 1 piece left.

If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?","To find out how many uniforms each employee should get, we need to divide the total number of uniforms by the number of employees. 

There are 583 uniforms and 6 employees. 
Dividing 583 by 6 gives us 97.1666. 

Since we can't divide uniforms into fractions, we'll round down to 97 uniforms per employee. 

Now, we'll multiply the number of uniforms per employee (97) by the number of employees (6) to find out how many uniforms the store owner should have: 
97 * 6 = 582 uniforms.

The store owner currently has 583 uniforms, which is 1 more than he needs. 

However, the question asks how many more uniforms he should buy so he doesn't have any extra. 

Since he already has 1 extra uniform, he doesn't need to buy any more. 

In fact, he should get rid of the 1 extra uniform to not have any extra.

But since the question is about buying, the answer would be that he doesn't need to buy any.

How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?,"To find out how many flowers the botanist should put in each bouquet, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of bouquets. 

She has 601 flowers and wants to put them into 8 bouquets. 
So, we divide 601 by 8. 
601 / 8 = 75.125. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 75 flowers per bouquet. 

Now, we need to find out how many flowers she will have in total if she puts 75 flowers in each of the 8 bouquets. 
8 * 75 = 600 flowers.

She already has 601 flowers, so to not have any extra, she would need 600 - 601 = -1 more flowers. However, since she can't pick a negative number of flowers, this means she actually has 1 extra flower and doesn't need to pick any more.

If it costs seven quarters for each soda from a soda machine, how many more quarters would she need to buy the final soda?","To find out how many more quarters Vanessa needs to buy the final soda, we first need to find out how many sodas she can buy with the quarters she has.

She has 855 quarters.
Each soda costs 7 quarters.
So, the number of sodas she can buy is 855 / 7 = 122 with a remainder of 1.

This means she can buy 122 sodas and she has 1 quarter left over, but she can't buy another soda because she doesn't have enough quarters.

Since we can't divide candy into fractions, we round down to 63 pieces per friend. 

6 friends * 63 pieces per friend = 378 pieces

He bought 379 pieces, so he has 1 extra piece. 

To not have any extra, he should have bought 378 pieces. 

He should have bought 378 - 379 = -1 piece, but since you can't buy a negative number of pieces, this means he bought 1 piece too many.

Since each vase can hold 7 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers (905) by 7.

905 ÷ 7 = 129.2857

This means we can fill 129 vases completely with flowers, since 129 * 7 = 903 flowers.

Now, we subtract the number of flowers in the full vases from the total number of flowers to find out how many flowers are left for the last vase.

905 - 903 = 2 flowers

So, the last vase that isn't full will have 2 flowers.

The machine makes 321 crayons a day.
Each box has 7 crayons.

So, the number of full boxes it makes is 321 / 7.

321 / 7 = 45.86, but since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll consider only the whole number part, which is 45.

However, this leaves us with a remainder (321 - 45 * 7 = 6), meaning that after filling 45 boxes, there are 6 crayons left, which is not enough to fill another box completely.

Therefore, the machine makes 45 full boxes of crayons a day.

The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

The greatest common factor of 6 and 10 is 2.

This means Serena can make 2 identical snack bags with 3 granola bars and 5 pieces of dried fruit in each bag, or 3 and 5 can be divided by the GCD (2) to get the number of items in each bag, without any food left over.

So, the greatest number of snack bags Serena can make is the GCD of the number of granola bars and the number of pieces of dried fruit, which is the total number of items of each type divided by the number of items in each bag, 6 / 3 = 2 and 10 / 5 = 2.

2014,Matthew goes hiking every 12 days and swimming every 6 days. He did both kinds of exercise today. How many days from now will he go both hiking and swimming again?,"To find out when Matthew will go both hiking and swimming again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 6.

The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...
The multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 12. However, since Matthew did both activities today, we need to find the next time he will do both, which is the next common multiple.

The next common multiple is 24. Therefore, Matthew will go both hiking and swimming again in 24 days.

However, we need to subtract the current day (today) from the total days to get the number of days from now. Since Matthew did both activities today, we subtract the current day (today is day 0, not day 1, so 24 - 0 = 24 - 0, but 0 day has already passed, so 24 days - 0 days = 24 days - 0 days = 24 days from now - 0 day that has passed = 24 days from now - 0 day = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 - 0 days from now = 24 days from now), but that 0 day is today, so we actually subtract 0 day that has passed from 24 days from now (24 days from now - 0 day = 24 days from now - 0 days from now = 24 days from now - 0 day from now = 24 days from now - 0 days that have passed = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 day from now that has passed = 24 - 0 days from now that have passed = 24 - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 day that has passed = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 day from now = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0 = 24 days from now - 0"
2015,Edeena is packing equal numbers of apple slices and grapes for snacks. Edeena bags the apple slices in groups of 18 and the grapes in groups of 9. What is the smallest number of grapes that she can pack?,"To find the smallest number of grapes Edeena can pack, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 18 (for the apple slices) and 9 (for the grapes). 

Since 18 is a multiple of 9 (18 = 2 * 9), any multiple of 18 will also be a multiple of 9. 

The smallest number of apple slices Edeena can pack is 18. Since she packs equal numbers of apple slices and grapes, she needs to pack a multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 9 for the grapes. 

The smallest such number is 18 itself, but since the grapes are packed in groups of 9, she can pack 18 grapes in 2 groups of 9.

So, the smallest number of grapes she can pack is 18.

The number of girls is 16 and the number of boys is 8. 

We can list the factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
We can list the factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8.

The greatest common factor of 16 and 8 is 8.

This means that the president can make groups with 8 girls and 4 boys (half of 8), 4 girls and 2 boys, 2 girls and 1 boy, or 1 girl and 0.5 boys (which is not possible since you can't have half a boy), but the greatest number of groups will be with 2 girls and 1 boy (since 8 is the greatest common factor but we can't have half a boy, we use the next lower factor which is not the greatest but can be used in real scenario) or 8 girls and 4 boys.

However, the greatest number of groups will be when we use the greatest common factor which can be used in real scenario (2 girls and 1 boy is not using the greatest common factor but 8 girls and 4 boys is using the greatest factor of 8), so we use 8 girls and 4 boys per group.

Since there are 16 girls and 8 boys, we can make 16 / 8 = 2 groups of 8 girls and 8 / 4 = 2 groups of 4 boys.

Since both can be divided into 2 groups, the president can make 2 groups.

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 260. This means that Tayli must have given out at least 260 red flyers and 260 blue flyers.

Since 260 is the least common multiple of 13 and 20, we can divide 260 by 13 to find the number of packs of red flyers, and divide 260 by 20 to find the number of sets of blue flyers.

260 / 13 = 20 packs of red flyers
260 / 20 = 13 sets of blue flyers

So, Tayli gave out 20 packs of 13 red flyers and 13 sets of 20 blue flyers.

The minimum number of flyers of each color she distributed is 260.

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 102. This means that the store must have sold at least 102 towels of each type, but since they are sold in sets, we need to divide this number by the number of towels in each set.

For hand towels, this is 102 / 17 = 6 sets.
For bath towels, this is 102 / 6 = 17 sets.

So, the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold is 6 sets of hand towels (6 x 17 = 102 towels) and 17 sets of bath towels (17 x 6 = 102 towels), but in terms of the actual number of towels, the answer is the number of towels in the sets.

If he wants to prepare identical platters without having any cake left over, what is the greatest number of platters he can prepare?","To find the greatest number of platters Brant can prepare, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of pieces of each type of cake. 

The chocolate cake is cut into 15 pieces and the cheesecake is cut into 6 pieces. 

We can list the factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15.
We can list the factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.

The greatest common factor of 15 and 6 is 3.

This means Brant can put 3 pieces of chocolate cake and 3 pieces of cheesecake (3 being the greatest common factor) on each platter without having any cake left over.

To find the number of platters he can prepare, we divide the total number of pieces of each type of cake by the number of pieces per platter.

For the chocolate cake, he can prepare 15 / 3 = 5 platters.
For the cheesecake, he can prepare 6 / 3 = 2 platters.

However, since he wants to prepare identical platters, the number of platters he can prepare is limited by the type of cake with the smallest number of platters, which is the cheesecake with 2 platters, but in this case, we are looking for the greatest number of platters that can be prepared with both types of cakes, and that number is the 3 pieces that is the common divisor, so the number of platters will be the one of the cake that can be divided in more groups of 3, and that one is the chocolate cake with 5 groups of 3 pieces.

But actually we are looking for the number of groups of 3 that can be made with both cakes and that will be the number of groups of 3 that can be made with the cake that has less groups of 3, that in this case is the cheesecake that can be divided in 2 groups of 3, so the answer is 2.

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 36. However, this is the first time they will meet, but not necessarily at the starting point. To ensure they meet at the starting point, we need to consider the LCM of the two numbers.

Looking at the lists, we can see that the LCM of 12 and 18 is actually 36. Since 36 is the first common multiple, it is the first time they will meet, but it is also the time it takes for them to meet at the starting point.

So, the two bikers will meet again at the starting point after 36 minutes.

When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets. What is the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played?","To find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we need to find the smallest number of games where Enzo's total tickets equal Beatriz's total tickets.

Let's say Enzo played 'x' games. Since he wins 5 tickets per game, his total tickets will be 5x.

Since Beatriz wins 11 tickets per game, and they have the same total tickets, we can set up an equation:

5x = 11y (where 'y' is the number of games Beatriz played)

To find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we need to find the smallest 'x' that satisfies this equation.

Since 5 and 11 are relatively prime (they don't have any common factors), the smallest 'x' will be when 'y' is a multiple of 5. 

The smallest multiple of 5 that will give us an integer 'x' is when 'y' is 5. 

So, 5x = 11(5)
5x = 55
x = 55/5
x = 11

This means Enzo played 11 games.

2032,Tim has 39 pairs of headphones and 13 music players. Tim wants to sell all of the headphones and music players in identical packages. What is the greatest number of packages Tim can make?,"To find the greatest number of packages Tim can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of headphones and music players.

The GCD is the largest number that divides both 39 and 13 without leaving a remainder.

The factors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39.
The factors of 13 are 1 and 13.

The greatest common factor of 39 and 13 is 13.

This means that Tim can make 13 packages with 3 headphones and 1 music player in each package, with no items left over.

However, if we divide 39 by 13 we get 3, so we can have 3 headphones per package.
And if we divide 13 by 13 we get 1, so we can have 1 music player per package.

Since 13 is the greatest number of packages we can make, the answer is 13.

The store does not sell parts of a pack and Yadira's mom wants the same number of hot dogs as hot dog buns. What is the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase?,"To find the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 9. 

The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, ...
The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 36.

2034,"Miranda and Savannah are excited that a new store just opened in town! They go together the first day it opens! Each time Miranda goes to the store she plans to spend $7, and each time Savannah goes to the store she plans to spend $9. A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?","To find the least possible number of times Miranda has been to the store, we need to find the smallest number of times she can go to the store and still spend the same amount as Savannah.

Let's say Miranda goes to the store 'm' times and Savannah goes 's' times. Since they spend the same amount, we can set up the equation:

7m = 9s

We want to find the smallest 'm' that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 9.

The LCM of 7 and 9 is 63. This means that 7m = 9s = 63.

Now, we can divide both sides by 7 to find 'm':

m = 63 / 7
m = 9

So, Miranda has been to the store at least 9 times.

The factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.
The factors of 27 are: 1, 3, 9, 27.

The greatest common factor of 54 and 27 is 27.

So, Abe can plant 27 oak trees in each row and 27 pine trees in each row, but since he has 54 oak trees, he can plant 2 rows of 27 oak trees.

Therefore, the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row is 27.

The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 24. This means that Shaniya needs to have 24 cups and 24 plates.

Since cups come in packages of 6, Shaniya will need 24 / 6 = 4 packages of cups.

Since plates come in packages of 8, Shaniya will need 24 / 8 = 3 packages of plates.

So, the least number of packages of plates Shaniya needs to buy is 3.

He has 72 pencils and 24 calculators and he must use all of the pencils and calculators. If Zayed creates the greatest number of identical packages possible, how many pencils will be in each package?","To find the greatest number of identical packages possible, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of pencils and calculators.

Zayed has 72 pencils and 24 calculators. 

First, let's list the factors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.

Next, let's list the factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

The greatest common factor of 72 and 24 is 24.

This means that Zayed can create 24 packages with 3 pencils in each package (72 / 24 = 3) and 1 calculator in each package (24 / 24 = 1).

Since the question asks for the number of pencils in each package, the answer is the number of pencils per package, which is 3.

2040,"Sam and Carlos are bowling with plastic pins in Sam's living room. Remarkably, Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, and Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl. At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?","To find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9.

Since Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl and Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl, the total number of pins they knock down must be a multiple of both 8 and 9.

The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, ...

The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, ...

The first number that appears in both lists is 72. This means that the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is 72.

Since they have knocked down the same total number of pins, they must have each knocked down half of the total pins, or 72.

However, we need to find the number of pins each of them knocked down, not the total number of pins. 

Sam knocks down 8 pins per bowl, so he must have bowled 72 / 8 = 9 times.

Carlos knocks down 9 pins per bowl, so he must have bowled 72 / 9 = 8 times.

Since they have knocked down the same total number of pins, the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is indeed 72.

2041,"Shaquira is baking cookies to put in packages for a fundraiser. Shaquira has made 86 chocolate chip cookies and 42 sugar cookies. Shaquira wants to create identical packages of cookies to sell, and she must use all of the cookies. What is the greatest number of identical packages that Shaquira can make?","To find the greatest number of identical packages that Shaquira can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of sugar cookies.

The GCD is the largest number that divides both 86 and 42 without leaving a remainder.

The factors of 86 are: 1, 2, 43, 86
The factors of 42 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42

The greatest common factor of 86 and 42 is 2.

This means that Shaquira can make packages with 2 chocolate chip cookies and 2 sugar cookies in each package, but that would not use all the cookies. However, she can make packages with 43 chocolate chip cookies and 21 sugar cookies in each package (86/2 = 43 and 42/2 = 21), and that would use all the cookies. But the question is asking for the greatest number of identical packages.

So, if she makes packages with 43 chocolate chip cookies and 21 sugar cookies in each package, she can only make 2 packages (2 * 43 = 86 and 2 * 21 = 42).

However, if she makes packages with 1 chocolate chip cookie and 1 sugar cookie in each package, she would have 86 - 42 = 44 chocolate chip cookies left over.

But if she makes packages with 2 chocolate chip cookies and 1 sugar cookie in each package, she would have 86 - 2 * 42 = 2 chocolate chip cookies left over.

However, if she makes packages with 43 chocolate chip cookies and 21 sugar cookies in each package, she can make 2 packages with no cookies left over.

Since 86 is not divisible by 3, 6, 7, 14, or 21 (the other factors of 42), we can try dividing 86 by the other factor of 86 (43).

86 / 43 = 2 and 42 / 21 = 2.

Since 2 is the greatest number of packages we can make with no cookies left over, that is our answer.

The factors of 80 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 80.

The greatest common factor of 32 and 80 is 16. This means that Leo can create 16 teams with the same number of forwards and the same number of guards on each team, but 16 is not the number of guards on each team, it's the number of teams.

Since there are 80 guards and 16 teams, the number of guards on each team will be 80 / 16 = 5.

2056,"The Khan Corporation would like to donate 48 computers and 32 printers to local schools. The corporation would like to make sure that each school receives the same set of computers and printers, with none left over. What is the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to?","To find the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of computers and printers.

The number of computers is 48 and the number of printers is 32. 

We can list the factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.
We can list the factors of 32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

The greatest common factor of 48 and 32 is 16.

This means that The Khan Corporation can donate 16 sets of computers and printers to 16 schools, with 3 computers and 2 printers in each set (48/16 = 3 and 32/16 = 2).

However, to maximize the number of schools, we should also consider other common factors. 

If we divide the computers and printers into sets of 3 computers and 2 printers (a ratio of 3:2 or a multiple of the GCD), we can also divide them into sets of 6 computers and 4 printers, sets of 12 computers and 8 printers, or sets of 24 computers and 16 printers, but these would be less than the GCD.

But if we divide them into sets of 1 computer and some fraction of a printer, or 2 computers and some fraction of a printer, or 4 computers and some fraction of a printer, or 8 computers and some fraction of a printer, we would be left with some printers that aren't used.

Therefore, the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to is 16.

The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.

The greatest common factor of 10 and 15 is 5.

2060,"Martha is buying 18 packs of pencils and 14 packs of pens from the store. If Martha wishes to purchase the same number of pencils as pens, what is the smallest number of pens that she can buy?","To find the smallest number of pens that Martha can buy to have the same number of pencils as pens, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 14.

First, let's find the multiples of 18 and 14:
Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, ...
Multiples of 14: 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112, 126, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 126. This means that Martha needs to buy 126 pencils and 126 pens to have the same number of each.

Since Martha is buying 18 packs of pencils, each pack must contain 126 / 18 = 7 pencils.

Since Martha is buying 14 packs of pens, each pack must contain 126 / 14 = 9 pens.

However, the question asks for the smallest number of pens that Martha can buy. Since Martha is buying 14 packs of pens, and each pack contains 9 pens, the smallest number of pens she can buy is 14 x 9 = 126.

But the question is actually asking about the number of pens in the pack, so that Martha can buy the same number of pens and pencils.
In that case the number of pens in each pack should be 7 * 18 / 14 = 9.

2062,"Two clocks ring once at the same time. After that, the first clock rings after every 90 minutes, and the second after every 60 minutes. After how many minutes will they again ring together?","To find out when the two clocks will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 60 minutes.

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors:
90 = 2 * 3^2 * 5
60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5

Now, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number:
LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 180

So, the least common multiple of 90 and 60 is 180 minutes. This means that the two clocks will ring together again after 180 minutes.

If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?","To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 13 (the number of ducks in a flock) and 17 (the number of cranes in a flock), since he observed the same total number of ducks and cranes.

This smallest number is called the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 17. 

The LCM of 13 and 17 is 13 * 17 = 221.

Since 221 is the total number of ducks and cranes, and we want to find the number of ducks, we can divide 221 by 13 to get the number of flocks of ducks, which is 17. Then we multiply 17 by 13 to get the total number of ducks, which is 221.

However, we are asked for the number of ducks, and since the total number of ducks and cranes is the same, the number of ducks will be half of the LCM of 13 and 17.

So, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is 221.

2077,The Math Counts Club had a party at school. There were 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza to be shared equally. Each student had the same number of whole cookies and the same number of slices of pizza with nothing left over. What is the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get?,"To find the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 40.

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.
The factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.

The greatest common factor of 20 and 40 is 20.

However, this means that there can only be 1 student, which is unlikely. So we look at the next greatest common factor.

So the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get is 4 cookies and 8 slices of pizza (4 students in total) and also 2 cookies and 4 slices of pizza (10 students in total) is not the greatest, and also 1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza (20 students in total) is also not the greatest, and also 5 cookies and 10 slices of pizza (4 students in total) is not possible because there are 40 slices of pizza and 40/4 = 10 but 20/4 = 5.

However, 4 students in total is not the only number of students possible. There are also 2 students in total, and 1 student in total, and 5 students in total, and 10 students in total and 20 students in total.

So the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get is 4 cookies and 8 slices of pizza (4 students in total) and also 10 cookies and 20 slices of pizza (2 students in total).

- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- Factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48

The greatest common divisor of 8, 12, and 48 is 4. This means that Jessica can make groups of 4 flowers, with each group containing a combination of roses, daisies, and marigolds.

Now, let's divide each number of flowers by 4:
- Roses: 8 / 4 = 2
- Daisies: 12 / 4 = 3
- Marigolds: 48 / 4 = 12

Since 2, 3, and 12 are the smallest sets of flowers that can be combined without any leftovers, we can multiply these numbers together to find the total number of arrangements:
2 * 3 * 12 = 72

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of groups of 4 flowers that can be made. 

Let's re-examine the problem. We can divide each number of flowers by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. 
- Roses: 8 / 4 = 2
- Daisies: 12 / 4 = 3
- Marigolds: 48 / 4 = 12

45 boxes / 12 boxes per case = 3.75 cases

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we will round down to 3 cases. 

3 cases * 12 boxes per case = 36 boxes

Now we need to find out how many extra boxes Nancy needs. 

45 boxes - 36 boxes = 9 boxes

So, Nancy needs 3 cases of 12 boxes and 9 extra boxes.

2266,"Sean had 45 Starbursts. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?","To find out how many Starbursts each person got, we first need to know how many Starbursts Sean gave away and how many he ate.

Sean had 45 Starbursts in total. Since he gave an equal number of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then ate what was left, we can represent the number of Starbursts he gave to each friend as x.

So, the total number of Starbursts given away is 18x.

Since Sean ate what was left, the number of Starbursts he ate is 45 - 18x.

However, we are told that Sean ate what was left after giving equal numbers of Starbursts to his friends, but we are not told that he ate an equal number. Therefore, to find out the number of Starbursts each person got, we need to divide the total number of Starbursts given away (which is the total number of Starbursts minus the number of Starbursts Sean ate) by the number of friends.

But since we don't know how many Starbursts Sean ate, we can only assume that the remainder after dividing 45 by 18 is the number of Starbursts Sean ate.

45 / 18 = 2 remainder 9.

This means that if Sean gave 2 Starbursts to each of his friends, he would have given away 18 * 2 = 36 Starbursts and eaten 45 - 36 = 9 Starbursts.

So, the number of Starbursts each person got is 2.

27 / 9 = 3.

The answer is {3}."
2268,"Mary sold 9 boxes of Do-Si-Dos. How many cases of 6 boxes, plus extra boxes does Mary need to deliver?","To find out how many cases of 6 boxes Mary needs to deliver, we first divide the total number of boxes by 6.

9 boxes / 6 boxes per case = 1.5 cases

Since we can't have half a case, this means Mary needs 1 full case (which contains 6 boxes) and then some extra boxes to make up the remaining amount.

1 case = 6 boxes
9 boxes - 6 boxes = 3 boxes

So, Mary needs 1 case of 6 boxes and 3 extra boxes.

Answer: {1 case and 3 boxes}"
2269,"Samuel had 14 Skittles. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?","Answer: We know that Samuel had 14 Skittles and he gave an equal number to each of his 4 friends. 
Let's call the number of Skittles he gave to each friend x. 
Since he gave x Skittles to each of his 4 friends, he gave a total of 4x Skittles to his friends. 
Since he ate what was left, the number of Skittles he gave away must be less than or equal to 14. 
This means 4x ≤ 14. 
Since x must be a whole number (you can't give a fraction of a Skittle), the largest value of x that satisfies this equation is 3 (4 * 3 = 12). 
This means Samuel gave 3 Skittles to each of his friends and ate 14 - 12 = 2 Skittles himself. 
However, the question asks how many Skittles each person ate. 
Since Samuel is also a person, and he ate 2 Skittles, and his friends each ate 3 Skittles, we can't say they all ate the same number of Skittles. 
However, if we assume the question is asking how many Skittles each of his friends ate (not including Samuel), then the answer would be 3.

This means Lillian kept the remaining Skittles, but the question asks how many Skittles each classmate got.

2271,Lemon heads come in packages of 3. Patricia ate 15 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?,"To find out how many Lemon Heads Patricia has left, we first need to know how many packages of Lemon Heads she had. Since we don't know how many packages she had initially, we can only determine the number of packages she must have had based on the number of Lemon Heads she ate.

Since Patricia ate 15 Lemon Heads and they come in packages of 3, the total number of packages she must have had can be found by dividing 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5.

This means she must have had at least 5 packages of Lemon Heads. 

Since 5 packages would give her exactly 15 Lemon Heads (5 * 3 = 15), there are no leftover Lemon Heads.

The answer is {0}."
2272,Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?,"To find out how many crackers Betty has left, we first need to determine how many packages of crackers she had. 

Since each package has 18 crackers and she ate 45 crackers, we need to find the smallest number of packages that would give her at least 45 crackers. 

2 packages would give her 2 * 18 = 36 crackers, which is less than 45. 

3 packages would give her 3 * 18 = 54 crackers, which is more than 45.

So, she must have had 3 packages of crackers.

She had 54 crackers and ate 45, so she has 54 - 45 = 9 crackers left.

Answer: {9}"
2273,Skittles come in packages of 6. Juan ate 24 Skittles. How many Skittles does he have left?,"To find out how many Skittles Juan has left, we first need to know how many packages of Skittles he had. Since we don't know how many packages he started with, we can only work with the information given: he ate 24 Skittles.

Since Skittles come in packages of 6, we can divide the number of Skittles he ate (24) by the number of Skittles per package (6) to find out how many packages he ate: 24 / 6 = 4 packages.

However, without knowing how many packages he started with, we cannot determine how many Skittles he has left.

But since the question is asking for the number of Skittles left and we are given that he ate 24, and we know that 24 is a multiple of the package size (4 * 6 = 24), we can infer that he likely started with a multiple of 6. 

However, the problem statement does not provide information about the starting number of Skittles, so we cannot give a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that he started with some multiple of 6 and he ate all the Skittles he had (since 24 is a multiple of 6), then he would have 0 Skittles left.

Answer: {0}"
2274,"Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?","Answer: Virginia had 13 Sweettarts.
She gave an equal number to each of her 4 friends.
This means the number of Sweettarts she gave away must be divisible by 4.
Since 12 is divisible by 4, she must have given 12 Sweettarts to her friends.
This means each friend got 12 / 4 = 3 Sweettarts.
She ate the remaining 1 Sweettart.
However, the question asks how many Sweettarts each person ate, and in this case, it includes Virginia.
