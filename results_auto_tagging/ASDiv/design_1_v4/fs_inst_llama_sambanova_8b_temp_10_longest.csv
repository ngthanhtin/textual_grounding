How much more?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. Hilt has <fact1>two pennies</fact1>, <fact2>two dimes</fact2>, and <fact3>two nickels</fact3>. Jacob has <fact4>four pennies</fact4>, <fact5>one nickel</fact5>, and <fact6>one dime</fact6>. How much more?
Answer: To find out how much more, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Hilt has and the total amount of money Jacob has. 

Mrs. Hilt has <fact1>two pennies</fact1>, which are worth <fact1>2 * $0.01 = $0.02</fact1>. She also has <fact2>two dimes</fact2>, which are worth <fact2>2 * $0.10 = $0.20</fact2>. And she has <fact3>two nickels</fact3>, which are worth <fact3>2 * $0.05 = $0.10</fact3>. So, in total, Mrs. Hilt has $0.02 + $0.20 + $0.10 = $0.32.

Jacob has <fact4>four pennies</fact4>, which are worth <fact4>4 * $0.01 = $0.04</fact4>. He also has <fact5>one nickel</fact5>, which is worth <fact5>$0.05</fact5>. And he has <fact6>one dime</fact6>, which is worth <fact6>$0.10</fact6>. So, in total, Jacob has $0.04 + $0.05 + $0.10 = $0.19.

Now that we have the total amount of money both Mrs. Hilt and Jacob have, we can find out how much more Mrs. Hilt has by subtracting the amount Jacob has from the amount Mrs. Hilt has. $0.32 - $0.19 = $0.13.

How much total time did she spend shoveling snow?

Answer: First, we need to convert <fact1>1 hour and 30 minutes</fact1> to just minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so <fact1>1 hour</fact1> is equal to 60 minutes. Adding <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> to that gives us a total of 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for <fact2>Saturday morning</fact2>. Now we need to add the time she spent shoveling snow on <fact4>Saturday afternoon</fact4>, which is <fact3>45 minutes</fact3>.

Answer: Mrs. Hilt saw <fact1>33 butterflies</fact1> in total. Since <fact4>20 of the butterflies</fact4> were <fact3>orange</fact3>, that means the remaining butterflies must be <fact2>red</fact2>. To find the number of <fact2>red</fact2> butterflies, we need to subtract the number of <fact3>orange</fact3> butterflies from the total number of butterflies. So, the number of <fact2>red</fact2> butterflies is <fact1>33</fact1> - <fact4>20</fact4> = 13. The answer is {13}."
154,Mrs. Hilt bought a pencil for 17 cents. She used exactly minimized coins to buy the pencil. How many coins did she use?,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Hilt bought a pencil for <fact1>17 cents</fact1>. She used exactly minimized coins to buy the pencil. How many coins did she use?
Answer: To find the number of coins Mrs. Hilt used, we need to determine the combination of coins that adds up to 17 cents using the fewest number of coins. The available coins are 1 cent, 5 cents, and 10 cents. 

We can start by using the largest denomination coin, which is 10 cents. Since 17 cents is more than 10 cents, we can use one 10-cent coin and one 5-cent coin and two 1-cent coins to add up to 17 cents. However, using two 5-cent coins and one 7-cent coin is not possible since we cannot use a 7-cent coin. The best combination is one 10-cent coin, one 5-cent coin, and two 1-cent coins. The answer is {4}."

The answer is {80}."
157,"Mrs. Hilt bought carnival tickets. The tickets cost $1 for 4 tickets. If Mrs. Hilt bought 12 tickets, how much did she pay?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. <fact1>Hilt</fact1> bought carnival tickets. The tickets cost <fact2>$1 for 4 tickets</fact2>. If Mrs. <fact1>Hilt</fact1> bought <fact3>12 tickets</fact3>, how much did she pay?
Answer: The tickets cost <fact2>$1 for 4 tickets</fact2>. This means that for every 4 tickets, Mrs. <fact1>Hilt</fact1> paid $1. Since she bought <fact3>12 tickets</fact3>, we can divide 12 by 4 to find out how many groups of 4 tickets she bought. 12 / 4 = 3. So, Mrs. <fact1>Hilt</fact1> bought 3 groups of 4 tickets.

161,I have 28 cents in my pocket. How coins could I have on minimization?,"Reformatted Question: I have <fact1>28 cents</fact1> in my pocket. How coins could I have on <fact2>minimization</fact2>?
Answer: To minimize the number of coins, we should use the largest denomination coins first. The largest denomination coin in US currency is the quarter, which is worth 25 cents. Since we have 28 cents, we can use 1 quarter (25 cents) and have 3 cents left. The next largest denomination coin is the dime, which is worth 10 cents. We can use 1 dime (10 cents) and have 3 cents left. The next largest denomination coin is the nickel, which is worth 5 cents. We can use 1 nickel (5 cents) and have 2 cents left. The smallest denomination coin is the penny, which is worth 1 cent. We can use 2 pennies (2 cents) to make up the remaining 2 cents. Therefore, the minimum number of coins we could have is 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies."

Answer: We are given that they sold <fact1>23 packs</fact1> on one village and <fact2>28 packs</fact2> on the other. Since the number of packs is the same as the number of cookies, we can assume that each pack contains the same number of cookies. To find the total number of cookies sold, we need to add the number of cookies sold in each village. However, the question asks for the number of cookies sold in the ""other villages"", which implies that we should subtract the number of cookies sold in the first village from the total number of cookies sold. The total number of cookies sold is <fact1>23</fact1> + <fact2>28</fact2> = 51. Since the question asks for the number of cookies sold in the other villages, we subtract the number of cookies sold in the first village: 51 - <fact1>23</fact1> = 28. However, the question asks for the number of cookies sold in the ""other villages"", which implies that we should subtract the number of cookies sold in the first village from the total number of cookies sold.

If the ants need 911 grains of food and they already have 762, how many more grains are needed to be gathered?","Reformatted Question: The ants need <fact1>911 grains of food</fact1> and they already have <fact2>762</fact2>. How many more grains are needed to be gathered?
Answer: The ants need <fact1>911 grains of food</fact1> in total. They already have <fact2>762</fact2> grains. To find out how many more grains are needed, we need to subtract the grains they already have from the total grains needed. So, we need to calculate <fact1>911</fact1> - <fact2>762</fact2>. This means we need to subtract <fact2>762</fact2> from <fact1>911</fact1>. To do this, we can first subtract the hundreds, then the tens, and finally the ones. Since <fact2>762</fact2> is less than <fact1>911</fact1>, we will have a positive difference. When we subtract the hundreds, we get 9 - 7 = 2. Then, we subtract the tens, 10 - 6 = 4. Finally, we subtract the ones, 1 - 2 = -1. Since we can't have a negative number of grains, we need to adjust the calculation. We can rewrite the subtraction as <fact1>911</fact1> - <fact2>762</fact2> = <fact1>911</fact1> + (<fact2>0</fact2> - <fact2>762</fact2>). When we rewrite the subtraction as an addition, we can add the numbers without worrying about the sign. So, <fact1>911</fact1> + (<fact2>0</fact2> - <fact2>762</fact2>) = <fact1>911</fact1> + (-<fact2>762</fact2>). When we add a negative number, we can think of it as subtracting the absolute value of the number. So, <fact1>911</fact1> + (-<fact2>762</fact2>) = <fact1>911</fact1> - <fact2>762</fact2>. Now, we can perform the calculation. We can subtract the hundreds, then the tens, and finally the ones. When we subtract the hundreds, we get 9 - 7 = 2. Then, we subtract the tens, 10 - 6 = 4. Finally, we subtract the ones, 1 - 2 = -1. Since we can't have a negative number of grains, we need to adjust the calculation. We can rewrite the subtraction as <fact1>911</fact1> - <fact2>762</fact2> = <fact1>911</fact1> - (700 + 60 + 2). When we rewrite the subtraction as a difference of sums, we can subtract the sums separately. So, <fact1>911</fact1> - (700 + 60 + 2) = <fact1>911</fact1> - 700 - 60 - 2. Now, we can perform the calculation. We can subtract the numbers separately. When we subtract 700 from 911, we get 211. Then, we subtract 60 from 211, we get 151. Finally, we subtract 2 from 151, we get 149. The answer is {149}."

Answer: To find out how much chips his brother should prepare, we need to know how much chips they already have. <fact1>He prepared 350 grams of chips</fact1> and <fact2>his father prepared 268 grams</fact2>. That means they have <fact1>350</fact1> + <fact2>268</fact2> = 618 grams of chips. Since they want to have <fact3>800 grams of chips</fact3> in total, his brother should prepare <fact3>800</fact3> - <fact1>618</fact1> = 182 grams of chips. The answer is {182}."

Answer: To find the total number of hotdogs brought by the neighbors, we need to add the number of hotdogs brought by the first neighbor and the number of hotdogs brought by the second neighbor. The second neighbor brought <fact2>25 less hotdogs</fact2> than the first one, which means they brought <fact1>75</fact1> - <fact2>25</fact2> = 50 hotdogs.

If they spent <fact2>$268.00 on food</fact2> and <fact3>$118.00 on utensils and other stuff</fact3>, how much did they spend on drinks?
Answer: We know that the total money they spent on food, drinks, and utensils sums up to <fact1>$560.00</fact1>. We also know that they spent <fact2>$268.00 on food</fact2> and <fact3>$118.00 on utensils and other stuff</fact3>. To find the amount they spent on drinks, we need to subtract the amount they spent on food and utensils from the total amount. This can be calculated as <fact1>$560.00</fact1> - (<fact2>$268.00</fact2> + <fact3>$118.00</fact3>). Using the order of operations, we first add <fact2>$268.00</fact2> and <fact3>$118.00</fact3> to get <fact2>$268.00</fact2> + <fact3>$118.00</fact3> = $386.00. Then we subtract this amount from <fact1>$560.00</fact1> to get <fact1>$560.00</fact1> - $386.00 = $174.00. Therefore, the amount they spent on drinks is $174.00. The answer is {174}."

How much farther is the island from the 2nd stopover?","Reformatted Question: Katie loves to travel. On her birthday, she decided to go on a trip on a mysterious continent. Her first destination was in an island of statues which is <fact1>436 miles</fact1> from her place. She took a plane that made two stopovers, the <fact2>1st stopover</fact2> after covering <fact3>132 miles</fact3> and the <fact4>2nd stopover</fact4> after another <fact5>236 miles</fact5>. How much farther is the island from the <fact4>2nd stopover</fact4>?

Answer: To find out how much farther the island is from the 2nd stopover, we need to subtract the distance covered up to the 2nd stopover from the total distance to the island. The distance covered up to the 2nd stopover is the sum of the distance covered in the 1st stopover and the distance covered in the 2nd stopover, which is <fact3>132 miles</fact3> + <fact5>236 miles</fact5> = 368 miles. Therefore, the distance from the island to the 2nd stopover is <fact1>436 miles</fact1> - 368 miles = 68 miles. The answer is {68}."

490,"Marian baked bread, cookies and pastries one Saturday at home for her family and friends this holiday season. She made 47 gingerbread cookies which she will distribute equally in tiny glass jars. If each jar is to contain six cookies each, how many cookies will not be placed in a jar?","Reformatted Question: Marian baked <fact1>47 gingerbread cookies</fact1> which she will distribute equally in tiny glass jars. If each jar is to contain <fact2>six cookies each</fact2>, how many cookies will not be placed in a jar?

Answer: Marian baked <fact1>47 gingerbread cookies</fact1>. She wants to put <fact2>6 cookies in each jar</fact2>. To find out how many jars she can fill, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per jar. So, <fact1>47</fact1> ÷ <fact2>6</fact2> = 7.83. Since we can't have a fraction of a jar, we can only fill 7 jars with 6 cookies each. To find out how many cookies are left, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cookies per jar: 7 * 6 = 42. Now, we subtract the number of cookies in the jars from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies will not be placed in a jar: <fact1>47</fact1> - 42 = 5. The answer is {5}."

If each neighbor received and equal number of croissants, how many will be left with Marian?
Answer: Marian prepared <fact1>59 croissants</fact1> and has <fact2>8 neighbors</fact2>. If each neighbor gets an equal number of croissants, we need to divide the total number of croissants by the number of neighbors. <fact1>59</fact1> ÷ <fact2>8</fact2> = 7 with a remainder of 3. This means each neighbor will get 7 croissants and there will be 3 croissants left with Marian. The answer is {3}."

If she can place <fact1>12 cookies</fact1> on a tray at a time, how many trays will she need to prepare <fact2>276 oatmeal cookies</fact2> at a time?
Answer: Marian can place <fact1>12 cookies</fact1> on a tray at a time. To find out how many trays she needs to prepare <fact2>276 cookies</fact2>, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per tray. This is similar to the problem where there were <fact3>9 computers</fact3> in the server room and <fact4>5 more computers</fact4> were installed each day, from <fact5>Monday to Thursday</fact5>. We divided the total number of computers added by the number of computers added each day to find the total number of days. In this case, we will divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per tray to find the total number of trays. So, <fact2>276</fact2> ÷ <fact1>12</fact1> = 23.

They had a long list of activities for spring cleaning. Susie's mom prepared <fact2>74 carrot sticks</fact2> for breakfast. If the carrots were served equally to <fact3>12 people</fact3>, how many carrot sticks were left uneaten?

Answer: There were <fact2>74 carrot sticks</fact2> in the beginning. They were served equally to <fact3>12 people</fact3>. To find out how many carrot sticks each person got, we need to divide the total number of carrot sticks by the number of people. So, <fact2>74</fact2> ÷ <fact3>12</fact3> = 6.22. Since you can't divide a carrot stick, each person got 6 carrot sticks. To find out how many carrot sticks were left uneaten, we need to subtract the total number of carrot sticks served from the total number of carrot sticks. The total number of carrot sticks served is <fact3>12</fact3> * <fact4>6</fact4> = 72. So, <fact2>74</fact2> - <fact3>72</fact3> = 2 carrot sticks were left uneaten. The answer is {2}."

If a full box can hold a maximum of <fact3>8 cards</fact3>, how many boxes were fully filled?
Answer: Since Joe collected <fact2>94 trading cards</fact2> and placed them in boxes, we need to determine how many boxes were fully filled. A full box can hold a maximum of <fact3>8 cards</fact3>.

If a full box can hold a maximum of <fact3>8 cards</fact3>, how many cards are there in the unfilled box?
Answer: We know that <fact2>94 trading cards</fact2> were collected and placed in boxes. The maximum capacity of each box is <fact3>8 cards</fact3>. To find the number of cards in the unfilled box, we need to determine how many full boxes can be filled with <fact2>94 cards</fact2>. We can do this by dividing <fact2>94</fact2> by <fact3>8</fact3>. This gives us a quotient of <fact4>11</fact4> with a remainder of <fact5>6</fact5>.

If they are to distribute the <fact3>matchboxes</fact3> equally to the <fact4>9 houses</fact4> in the <fact5>first block</fact5>, how many <fact6>colorful matchboxes</fact6> will they have left?

Answer: To find out how many matchboxes they will have left, we need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses. There are <fact1>119 matchboxes</fact1> in total and they will be distributed to <fact4>9 houses</fact4>. So, we divide <fact1>119</fact1> by <fact4>9</fact4> to get the number of matchboxes each house will get. This is <fact1>119</fact1> / <fact4>9</fact4> = 13.22. Since we can't divide matchboxes into fractions, each house will get 13 matchboxes. To find out how many matchboxes are left, we multiply the number of houses by the number of matchboxes each house gets, which is <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact7>13</fact7> = 117. Now, we subtract the total number of matchboxes given out from the initial number of matchboxes to find out how many are left. This is <fact1>119</fact1> - <fact8>117</fact8> = 2. The answer is {2}."

To find out how many stars will be left unpainted, we need to divide the total number of stars by the number of cans of paint. This is because we want to distribute the stars equally to the cans of paint. So, we will divide <fact2>34</fact2> by <fact1>4</fact1>. This gives us 34 ÷ 4 = 8.5. However, we cannot have a fraction of a star, so we will round down to 8 stars per can of paint. This means that there will be 34 - (4 * 8) = 34 - 32 = 2 stars left unpainted. The answer is {2}."

If she expects her 6 sweet-tooth guests to share the butterscotch among them equally, how many will be left unconsumed?","Reformatted Question: Drew prepared <fact1>61 servings of butterscotch</fact1>. If she expects her <fact2>6 sweet-tooth guests</fact2> to share the butterscotch among them equally, how many will be left unconsumed?

Answer: If there are <fact2>6 sweet-tooth guests</fact2>, they will share the butterscotch equally. This means each guest will get <fact1>61</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2> = 10.16667 servings. Since you cannot have a fraction of a serving, we will round down to 10 servings per guest. Now we need to find out how many servings will be left unconsumed. We can do this by subtracting the total number of servings consumed (10 * 6) from the total number of servings prepared (61). So, the number of servings left unconsumed is 61 - (10 * 6) = 61 - 60 = 1. The answer is {1}."

If he can read exactly <fact2>30 pages a day</fact2>, how many days will it take Lex to finish reading the book?
Answer: To find the number of days it will take Lex to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages he can read per day. This is because if he can read <fact2>30 pages a day</fact2>, it will take him 1 day to read 30 pages, 2 days to read 60 pages, and so on. Therefore, to find the total number of days, we divide the total number of pages in the book, which is <fact1>420 pages</fact1>, by the number of pages he can read per day, which is <fact2>30 pages</fact2>. This gives us 420 / 30 = 14 days. The answer is {14}."

516,"Instead of buying from the store, Melody made Christmas cards for the elderly in a nursing home. She had 99 blue sequins which she plans to use as snowflakes for the cards. If she distributes the sequins equally to 12 cards, how many sequins will Melody have left?","Reformatted Question: Melody had <fact1>99 blue sequins</fact1> which she plans to use as <fact2>snowflakes</fact2> for the cards. If she distributes the sequins equally to <fact3>12 cards</fact3>, how many sequins will Melody have left?
Answer: Melody initially had <fact1>99 sequins</fact1>. She is distributing them equally to <fact3>12 cards</fact3>. To find out how many sequins each card will have, we need to divide the total number of sequins by the number of cards. That is, <fact1>99</fact1> / <fact3>12</fact3> = 8.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a sequin, we will round down to 8 sequins per card. Now, we need to find out how many sequins Melody will have left. To do this, we will multiply the number of cards by the number of sequins per card, which is <fact3>12</fact3> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 96. This means Melody will have 96 sequins on the cards. To find out how many sequins Melody will have left, we need to subtract the number of sequins on the cards from the total number of sequins. That is, <fact1>99</fact1> - <fact5>96</fact5> = 3.

Answer: She bought <fact2>5 bagels</fact2> for <fact3>$3 each</fact3>. This means she spent <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact3>$3</fact3> = $15 on the bagels. She had <fact1>$23</fact1> in the beginning, so now she has <fact1>$23</fact1> - $15 = $8. The answer is {8}.

Reformatted Question: She had 35 mistletoe stickers and wanted to place them equally in 8 cards. How many mistletoe stickers will she have left?
Answer: She had <fact1>35 stickers</fact1> and wanted to place them equally in <fact2>8 cards</fact2>. To find out how many stickers each card will have, we divide <fact1>35</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2>. 35 ÷ 8 = 4.375. Since we can't have a fraction of a sticker, each card will have 4 stickers. To find out how many stickers she has left, we multiply <fact2>8</fact2> by the number of stickers each card has, which is <fact3>4</fact3>. 8 * 4 = 32. However, we are looking for the number of stickers she has left, not the number of stickers in the cards. Since she placed 32 stickers in the cards, she has <fact1>35</fact1> - <fact2>32</fact2> = 3 stickers left. The answer is {3}."

They both brought them to school for a party. How many cookies did they have altogether?
Answer: Cindy's mom baked <fact1>1215 cookies</fact1> and Paul's dad baked <fact2>1112 cookies</fact2>. To find the total number of cookies, we need to add the number of cookies each of them baked. So, we have <fact1>1215</fact1> + <fact2>1112</fact2> cookies altogether. To calculate this, we can add the hundreds place, tens place, and ones place separately. The hundreds place of <fact1>1215</fact1> is 1 and the hundreds place of <fact2>1112</fact2> is 1. The sum of the hundreds place is 1 + 1 = 2. The tens place of <fact1>1215</fact1> is 2 and the tens place of <fact2>1112</fact2> is 1. The sum of the tens place is 2 + 1 = 3. The ones place of <fact1>1215</fact1> is 5 and the ones place of <fact2>1112</fact2> is 2. The sum of the ones place is 5 + 2 = 7. Now we can combine the hundreds place, tens place, and ones place to get the total number of cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 7 * 1 = 200 + 30 + 7 = 237.

If the fudge is cut into square pieces <fact3>1 inch</fact3> on each side, how many pieces of fudge does the pan hold?

Answer: To find out how many pieces of fudge the pan holds, we need to find the area of the pan first. The area of a rectangle (which is the shape of the pan) is given by the formula length * width. In this case, the length is <fact1>18 inches</fact1> and the width is <fact2>29 inches</fact2>. So, the area of the pan is <fact1>18</fact1> * <fact2>29</fact2> = 522 square inches. Since each piece of fudge is 1 inch by 1 inch, the area of each piece is 1 square inch. To find out how many pieces of fudge the pan holds, we need to divide the total area of the pan by the area of each piece. So, we divide 522 by 1, which equals 522. The answer is {522}."

Answer: Lizette has <fact1>813 stamps</fact1>. This is <fact2>125 more stamps</fact2> than Minerva. To find the number of stamps Minerva has, we need to subtract <fact2>125</fact2> from <fact1>813</fact1>. This is because if Minerva has x stamps and Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva, then Lizette has x + 125 stamps. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 125 = 813. To find the value of x, we need to subtract 125 from both sides of the equation. This gives us x = 813 - 125. Solving for x, we get x = 688. Therefore, Minerva has 688 stamps. The answer is {688}."

Answer: Connie initially had <fact4>593 marbles</fact4> and gave <fact2>183 marbles</fact2> to <fact3>Juan</fact3>. To find out how many she had in the beginning, we need to add the marbles she gave away to the marbles she has now. This is because she had some marbles and gave <fact2>183 marbles</fact2> away, so the marbles she has now is the marbles she had initially minus the marbles she gave away. The marbles she had initially is the marbles she has now plus the marbles she gave away. Therefore, she had <fact4>593 marbles</fact4> + <fact2>183 marbles</fact2> = 776 marbles initially.

She wants to share them equally among her <fact2>3 children</fact2> so that no one gets more than anyone else. If she gives each child as many cupcakes as possible, how many cupcakes will be left over for Ms. Baker to eat?

Answer: To find out how many cupcakes will be left over for Ms. Baker to eat, we need to first determine how many cupcakes each child will get. Since she wants to share them equally, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of children. The number of cupcakes each child will get is <fact1>17</fact1> ÷ <fact2>3</fact2> = 5 cupcakes with a remainder of 2 cupcakes. This means each child will get 5 cupcakes, and 2 cupcakes will be left over for Ms. Baker to eat. The answer is {2}."
672,89 cookies are being shared equally among 4 people. How many does each person get?,"Reformatted Question: 89 cookies are being shared equally among <fact1>4 people</fact1>. How many does each person get?
Answer: There are <fact1>4 people</fact1> sharing the cookies. The cookies are being shared <fact2>equally</fact2>, which means each person will get the same number of cookies. To find out how many cookies each person will get, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of people. The total number of cookies is <fact3>89</fact3>. So, we will divide <fact3>89</fact3> by <fact1>4</fact1>. This gives us <fact3>89</fact3> / <fact1>4</fact1> = 22.25. Since we can't divide cookies into fractions, we will round down to 22 cookies per person."
673,19 children take a minibus to the zoo. They are to sit 2 or 3 to a seat. There are 7 seats. How many seats will have 3 children seated on them?,"Reformatted Question: 19 children take a minibus to the zoo. They are to sit <fact1>2 or 3 to a seat</fact1>. There are <fact2>7 seats</fact2>. How many seats will have <fact3>3 children seated on them</fact3>?

Answer: To find the number of seats with 3 children, we first need to determine the total number of children that can be seated in the 7 seats. Since they can sit 2 or 3 to a seat, let's consider the maximum number of children that can be seated, which is 3 children per seat. This would mean that all 7 seats are filled with 3 children each. So, the maximum number of children that can be seated is 7 * <fact3>3</fact3> = 21. However, we are only given 19 children. This means that the remaining seats will be filled with 2 children each. Since we have 7 seats, and 3 seats will be filled with 3 children, the remaining 4 seats will be filled with 2 children each. Therefore, the number of seats with 3 children seated on them is <fact3>3</fact3>."
674,"Many families serve each person in the family one 6-ounce glass of orange juice each morning. If they buy orange juice by the gallon, how many whole servings of juice will they get out of one gallon (one gallon = 4 quarts, 1 quart = 32 ounces) of juice?","Reformatted Question: Many families serve each person in the family one <fact1>6-ounce</fact1> glass of <fact2>orange juice</fact2> each morning.

Answer: We need to find out how many <fact5>servings</fact5> of <fact6>juice</fact6> are in one <fact4>gallon</fact4> of <fact3>orange juice</fact3>. First, we know that one <fact4>gallon</fact4> = <fact7>4 quarts</fact7>. We also know that <fact8>1 quart</fact8> = <fact9>32 ounces</fact9>. So, one <fact4>gallon</fact4> = <fact7>4</fact7> * <fact9>32</fact9> = <fact10>128 ounces</fact10> of <fact3>orange juice</fact3>. Each serving is <fact1>6-ounce</fact1>, so the number of servings is <fact10>128</fact10> ÷ <fact1>6</fact1> = <fact11>21.33</fact11>.

675,A company donates 935 pencils to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among 9 classrooms. The rest of the pencils are given to the library. How many pencils were donated to the library?,"Reformatted Question: A company donates <fact1>935 pencils</fact1> to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>. The rest of the pencils are given to the <fact3>library</fact3>. How many pencils were donated to the <fact3>library</fact3>?

Answer: The total number of pencils donated is <fact1>935</fact1>. The pencils are divided evenly among <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>, so the number of pencils in each classroom is <fact1>935</fact1> / <fact2>9</fact2> = 104. Since there are <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>, the total number of pencils in the classrooms is 104 * <fact2>9</fact2> = 936. To find the number of pencils donated to the <fact3>library</fact3>, we subtract the number of pencils in the classrooms from the total number of pencils: <fact1>935</fact1> - 936 = -1. However, since we cannot have a negative number of pencils, we made an error in our calculation. The number of pencils donated to the library is actually <fact1>935</fact1> - 936 = -1. Since the number of pencils donated to the library is -1, we made a mistake. Let's recheck the calculation. The total number of pencils donated is <fact1>935</fact1>. The pencils are divided evenly among <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>, so the number of pencils in each classroom is <fact1>935</fact1> / <fact2>9</fact2> = 104. Since there are <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>, the total number of pencils in the classrooms is 104 * <fact2>9</fact2> = 936. We know that we made an error in our calculation."
676,A company donates 935 pencils to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among 9 classrooms. The rest of the pencils are given to the library. How many pencils were donated to the library?,"Reformatted Question: A company donates <fact1>935 pencils</fact1> to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>. The rest of the pencils are given to the <fact3>library</fact3>. How many pencils were donated to the <fact3>library</fact3>?

Answer: The total number of pencils donated to the school is <fact1>935</fact1>. They are divided evenly among <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>, so each classroom gets <fact1>935</fact1> / <fact2>9</fact2> = 104 pencils. To find the number of pencils left, we need to find the remainder of the division of <fact1>935</fact1> by <fact2>9</fact2>. Using the division algorithm, we can write <fact1>935 = <fact2>9</fact2> * 104 + <fact3>R</fact3>, where <fact3>R</fact3> is the remainder. Since 935 is the total number of pencils, <fact3>R</fact3> must be the number of pencils left. To find <fact3>R</fact3>, we can subtract <fact2>9</fact2> * 104 from <fact1>935</fact1>, which is <fact1>935</fact1> - <fact2>9</fact2> * 104 = <fact3>R</fact3>. Therefore, <fact3>R</fact3> = <fact1>935</fact1> - <fact2>9</fact2> * 104 = 935 - 936 = -1. However, since we are counting the number of pencils, we cannot have a negative number. Therefore, we need to find the number of pencils that were not divided evenly among the classrooms. This is equal to the total number of pencils that were not divided evenly among the classrooms, which is <fact1>935</fact1> - <fact2>9</fact2> * 104 = 935 - 936 = -1. However, since we are counting the number of pencils, we cannot have a negative number. Therefore, we need to find the number of pencils that were not divided evenly among the classrooms. This is equal to the remainder of the division of <fact1>935</fact1> by <fact2>9</fact2>, which is 935 % 9 = 1."

Answer: Mrs. Hilt has <fact1>6 pizzas</fact1>. Each pizza has <fact2>6 slices</fact2>. This means she has a total of <fact1>6</fact1> * <fact2>6</fact2> = 36 slices. She sold <fact3>one-fourth of the pizza slices</fact3>. One-fourth of 36 is <fact3>36 / 4 = 9</fact3>. So she sold 9 slices. To find out how many slices were left, we need to subtract the number of slices she sold from the total number of slices. Therefore, she has <fact1>36</fact1> - <fact3>9</fact3> = 27 slices left. The answer is {27}."
680,"Mrs. Hilt wants to buy a television that regularly costs $600.

Answer: The regular price of the television is <fact1>$600</fact1>. The sale price is <fact2>20% off the regular price</fact2>. To find the sale price, we need to find 20% of the regular price and subtract it from the regular price. 20% of the regular price is 20% of <fact1>$600</fact1> = 0.2 * <fact1>$600</fact1> = $120.

She earned <fact2>10% interest</fact2> <fact3>each year</fact3>. If she left that money in the account for <fact4>one year</fact4>, how much will she have in the account at the end of that year?
Answer: Mrs. Hilt had <fact1>$4,000 in her savings account</fact1>. She earned <fact2>10% interest</fact2> <fact3>each year</fact3>. If she left that money in the account for <fact4>one year</fact4>, that means she earned interest for <fact3>one year</fact3>. To find the interest earned, we need to find <fact2>10%</fact2> of <fact1>$4,000</fact1>. To find <fact2>10%</fact2> of a number, we multiply that number by <fact5>0.1</fact5>. So, <fact1>$4,000</fact1> * <fact5>0.1</fact5> = <fact6>$400</fact6>. This is the interest earned. Now, we need to add this interest to the initial amount. So, <fact1>$4,000</fact1> + <fact6>$400</fact6> = <fact7>$4,400</fact7>. The answer is {4400}."

Answer: Georgia had <fact1>4 yellow buttons</fact1>, <fact2>2 black buttons</fact3> and <fact3>3 green buttons</fact3> in the beginning. This means she had <fact1>4</fact1> + <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>3</fact3> = 9 buttons. Since she gave some buttons to Mary and she has <fact4>5 left</fact4>, she must have given <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 4 buttons to Mary. The answer is {4}."

693,"There are some children at a bakery. As they were deciding what to buy, 24 girls came in and 31 boys left. If there are 78 children in the bakery in the end, how many children were there at first?","Reformatted Question: If there are <fact1>78 children</fact1> in the bakery in the end, and <fact2>24 girls came in</fact2> and <fact3>31 boys left</fact3>, how many children were there at first?
Answer: We know that there are <fact1>78 children</fact1> in the end. Since <fact2>24 girls came in</fact2>, the number of children in the end is the sum of the children that were there initially and the girls that came in. This means that the number of children in the end is equal to the number of children initially plus 24. So, we can write this as: <fact1>78 = number of children initially + 24</fact1>. We also know that <fact3>31 boys left</fact3>, but this information is not necessary to solve the problem because we are only interested in the number of children that were there initially. To find the number of children initially, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: <fact1>78 - 24 = number of children initially</fact1>. This simplifies to <fact1>54 = number of children initially</fact1>. The answer is {54}."
694,"Blithe has a lot of toys. He lost 6 of them and found 9 in his closet. If he had 43 after that, how many toys did Blithe have at first?","Reformatted Question: Blithe has a lot of toys. He lost <fact1>6 of them</fact1> and found <fact2>9 in his closet</fact2>. If he had <fact3>43 after that</fact3>, how many toys did Blithe have at first?
Answer: We know that Blithe had <fact3>43 toys</fact3> after losing <fact1>6 toys</fact1> and finding <fact2>9 toys</fact2>. If he found <fact2>9 toys</fact2>, that means he had <fact3>43 - 9 = 34 toys</fact3> before finding them. Then, if he lost <fact1>6 toys</fact1> before finding <fact2>9 toys</fact2>, he must have had <fact3>34 + 6 = 40 toys</fact3> before losing them. Therefore, Blithe had <fact3>40 toys</fact3> at first."
695,"Lena had some pocket money. She lost $4 and her mom gave her $9.

She lost <fact2>$4</fact2> and her mom gave her <fact3>$9</fact3>. If she had <fact4>$66</fact4> after that, how many dollars did Lena have at first?

Answer: Let's denote the initial amount of money Lena had as <fact1>x</fact1>. After losing <fact2>$4</fact2>, she had <fact1>x</fact1> - <fact2>$4</fact2>. Then, her mom gave her <fact3>$9</fact3>, so she had <fact1>x</fact1> - <fact2>$4</fact2> + <fact3>$9</fact3>. According to the problem, this amount is equal to <fact4>$66</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: <fact1>x</fact1> - <fact2>$4</fact2> + <fact3>$9</fact3> = <fact4>$66</fact4>. Solving for <fact1>x</fact1>, we get: <fact1>x</fact1> = <fact4>$66</fact4> - <fact2>$4</fact2> + <fact3>$9</fact3> = $71. The answer is {71}."

At a bus stop, <fact2>7 more passengers got on the bus</fact2> and <fact3>9 passengers got off</fact3>. If there are <fact4>26 passengers in the bus in the end</fact4>, how many passengers were there at first?

Answer: Let's denote the initial number of passengers as x. After <fact2>7 more passengers got on the bus</fact2>, the number of passengers became x + 7. Then, <fact3>9 passengers got off</fact3>, so the number of passengers became x + 7 - 9. We are told that in the end, there are <fact4>26 passengers in the bus</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 7 - 9 = 26. Solving for x, we get x = 26 + 9 - 7 = 28. So, there were 28 passengers at first. The answer is {28}."

Answer: Bruno initially had some story books. He lost <fact1>4 of them</fact1>, so after that he had some - <fact1>4</fact1> = some - 4 = some + (-4) = -4 + some = some - 4. Then he got <fact2>10 more books</fact2>, so he had some - 4 + 10 = some - 4 + 10 = some + (10 - 4) = some + 6. He had <fact3>39 books after that</fact3>, so some + 6 = 39. To find some, we need to subtract 6 from both sides: some = 39 - 6 = 33. The answer is {33}."

The owner sold <fact2>48 pineapples</fact2>. <fact3>9 of the remaining pineapples</fact3> were rotten and thrown away. How many fresh pineapples are left?

Answer: We start with <fact1>86 pineapples</fact1>. After <fact2>48 pineapples</fact2> were sold, there were <fact1>86</fact1> - <fact2>48</fact2> = 38 pineapples left.

If there are <fact2>248 vases of flowers</fact2> to be arranged, how many vases of flowers will she arrange on the last day?
Answer: Jane can arrange <fact1>16 vases of flowers</fact1> in a day. To find out how many days it will take her to arrange all the vases, we need to divide the total number of vases by the number she can arrange in a day. So, we have <fact2>248 vases</fact2> to be arranged, and she can arrange <fact1>16 vases</fact1> in a day. Therefore, the number of days required is <fact2>248</fact2> / <fact1>16</fact1> = 15.5 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 16 days.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to hold all the chalk. We can do this by dividing the total number of chalk pieces by the number of pieces each box can hold. Since each box can hold <fact1>18 pieces of chalk</fact1>, we divide <fact2>3,484 pieces of chalk</fact2> by <fact1>18 pieces of chalk</fact1>. This gives us <fact2>3,484</fact2> ÷ <fact1>18</fact1> = 194.44. However, we cannot have a fraction of a box, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means we can fill <fact3>194 boxes</fact3> to hold all the chalk, but they will not be full. To find out how many boxes are full, we need to subtract the number of boxes that are not full from the total number of boxes. Since we cannot fill all 194 boxes to the top, we need to find out how many boxes are not full. To do this, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces each box can hold. This gives us <fact3>194 boxes</fact3> * <fact1>18 pieces of chalk</fact1> = 3,492 pieces of chalk. Since we have 8 extra pieces of chalk, we need to subtract 8 from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes are not full. This gives us <fact3>194 boxes</fact3> - 8 = 186 boxes that are not full. However, the question asks for the number of boxes that are full, not the number of boxes that are not full is not relevant to answering the question. Since the question asks for the number of boxes that are full to hold all the chalk, we need to subtract the number of boxes that are not full from the total number of boxes, however, we do not know the total number of boxes. We know that the number of boxes that are not full is 186, but we do not know the total number of boxes. We do know that the total number of boxes is at least 194, since we can fill 194 boxes to hold all the chalk. Since we do not know the total number of boxes, we cannot give an exact answer. However, we can say that the number of boxes that are full to hold all the chalk is at least 194 - 186 = 8 boxes."

Answer: To find out how many paper bags Edgar needs, we need to divide the total number of cookies he bought by the number of cookies a paper bag can hold. This is because each paper bag can hold <fact1>16 cookies</fact1>, so we need to divide <fact2>292 cookies</fact2> by <fact1>16 cookies</fact1>. 

To do this division, we can use the following calculation: <fact2>292 cookies</fact2> ÷ <fact1>16 cookies</fact1> = 18.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a paper bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because Edgar needs to have enough paper bags to hold all of the cookies he bought, and he can't use a fraction of a paper bag.

Therefore, Edgar needs to buy 19 paper bags to hold all of the cookies he bought."
764,"A paper bag can hold 16 cookies. If Edgar buys 292 cookies, how many cookies are there in the paper bag that is not full?","Reformatted Question: If Edgar buys <fact1>292 cookies</fact1>, how many cookies are there in the paper bag that is not full?

Answer: The bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1>. The school has <fact2>1,230 students and teachers</fact2>. To find out how many passengers are on the bus, we need to find out how many passengers can fit on the bus and how many are going on the field trip. Since the bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1>, we need to divide the total number of students and teachers by 48 to see how many buses are needed. 

First, we need to find out how many buses are needed to transport all the students and teachers. We can do this by dividing the total number of students and teachers by the number of passengers each bus can transport. 

We have <fact2>1,230 students and teachers</fact2> and each bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1>. To find out how many buses are needed, we divide <fact2>1,230</fact2> by <fact1>48</fact1>. 

<fact2>1,230</fact2> ÷ <fact1>48</fact1> = 25.625. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need 26 buses to transport all the students and teachers. 

However, the question asks how many passengers are on the bus that is not fully occupied. Since the bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1> and we only need 25 buses to transport all the students and teachers, we need to find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus. 

The 25th bus will have <fact1>48 passengers</fact1> but since we only need 25 buses, we need to find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus. 

To find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus, we need to multiply the number of buses needed by the number of passengers each bus can transport. 

We have 25 buses and each bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1>. To find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus, we multiply 25 by <fact1>48</fact1>. 

25 * <fact1>48</fact1> = 1200. 

However, the question asks how many passengers are on the bus that is not fully occupied. Since the bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1> and we only need 25 buses to transport all the students and teachers, we need to find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus. 

To find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus, we need to subtract the number of passengers on the other 24 buses from the total number of passengers on 25 buses. 

We have 25 buses and each bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1>. To find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus, we need to subtract the number of passengers on the other 24 buses from the total number of passengers on 25 buses. 

We have 24 buses and each bus can transport <fact1>48 passengers</fact1>. To find out how many passengers are on the other 24 buses, we multiply 24 by <fact1>48</fact1>. 

24 * <fact1>48</fact1> = 1152. 

To find out how many passengers are on the 25th bus, we need to subtract 1152 from 1200.

Answer: If Tom fixes <fact2>12 watches per day</fact2>, and he has to fix <fact1>158 watches</fact1>, we need to find out how many days it will take him to fix all the watches. To do that, we can divide the total number of watches by the number of watches he fixes per day. So, <fact1>158</fact1> ÷ <fact2>12</fact2> = 13.1666... Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means it will take him 13 days to fix 156 watches. On the 13th day, he will fix the remaining watches. The number of watches he fixes on the 13th day will be the total number of watches minus the number of watches he fixes in the first 12 days. Since he fixes 12 watches per day, in 12 days he will fix 12 * 12 = 144 watches. Therefore, on the last day, he will fix <fact1>158</fact1> - <fact2>144</fact2> = 14 watches. The answer is {14}."

Answer: To find out how many pages he will read on the last day, we need to first determine how many days it will take him to finish the book. Since he reads <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>, we can divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages he reads per day. The number of pages in the book is <fact1>285 pages</fact1>. So, the number of days it will take him to finish the book is <fact1>285 pages</fact1> / <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>. 

We can calculate this by dividing 285 by 23, which equals 12.39. However, since he can't read a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. This means it will take him 13 days to finish the book. 

Now that we know it will take him 13 days to finish the book, we can find out how many pages he will read on the last day. Since he reads <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>, we can multiply the number of days it will take him to finish the book by the number of pages he reads per day. The number of days it will take him to finish the book is 13 days. So, the number of pages he will read on the last day is 13 days * <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>. 

We can calculate this by multiplying 13 by 23, which equals 299. However, we are looking for the number of pages he will read on the last day, not the total number of pages he will read in 13 days. Since he will finish the book on the 13 days, he will read the last page on the 13th day. This means he will read the 285th page on the 13th day."

Answer: Mrs. Smith gave <fact1>53 strawberries</fact1> to <fact2>8 girls</fact2>. To find out how many strawberries each girl got, we need to divide the total number of strawberries by the number of girls. This means we have to calculate <fact1>53</fact1> ÷ <fact2>8</fact2> = 6.625. Since we can't divide strawberries into fractions, we round down to 6 strawberries per girl. The answer is {6}."
774,Mrs. Smith gave 53 strawberries to 8 girls equally. How many strawberries were left?,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Smith gave <fact1>53 strawberries</fact1> to <fact2>8 girls</fact2> equally. How many strawberries were left?
Answer: Mrs. Smith gave <fact1>53 strawberries</fact1> to <fact2>8 girls</fact2> equally. To find out how many strawberries each girl got, we need to divide <fact1>53</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2>. This is because the strawberries were given equally, so each girl must have gotten the same amount. To divide <fact1>53</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2>, we can use the division operation: 53 ÷ 8 = 6 with a remainder of 5. This means that each girl got 6 strawberries, and there were 5 strawberries left over. Since there were 5 strawberries left over, the answer is 5."

Answer: Since Mike divided the laptops equally into <fact2>5 rows</fact2>, this means each row has the same number of laptops. To find out how many laptops each row has, we need to divide the total number of laptops by the number of rows. The total number of laptops is <fact1>44</fact1> and the number of rows is <fact2>5</fact2>. So, we divide <fact1>44</fact1> by <fact2>5</fact2> to get 8.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a laptop, we round down to 8 laptops per row. This means there are 8 laptops in each row. To find out how many laptops are left, we need to find out how many laptops were left over after dividing them into rows. To do this, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of laptops per row and subtract the result from the total number of laptops. The number of rows is <fact2>5</fact2> and the number of laptops per row is 8. So, we multiply <fact2>5</fact2> by 8 to get 40. Then we subtract 40 from <fact1>44</fact1> to get 4.

Answer: There are <fact1>32 students</fact1> in the class. The teacher divided them into <fact2>5 equal groups</fact2>. To find the number of students in each group, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. This means we have to divide <fact1>32</fact1> by <fact2>5</fact2>. The result of this division is <fact1>32</fact1> / <fact2>5</fact2> = 6.4. However, we cannot have a fraction of a student. Therefore, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round down to 6 students per group. To find the total number of students in the groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups. This means we have to multiply 6 by <fact2>5</fact2>, which equals 30.

793,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?","Reformatted Question: A transport company bought <fact1>95 tons of oil</fact1>. A large barrel can hold <fact2>6 tons of oil</fact2> and a small barrel can hold <fact3>5 tons of oil</fact3>. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?
Answer: To use the least number of barrels, we should use as many large barrels as possible, because they hold more oil than small barrels. We can calculate the maximum number of large barrels by dividing the total amount of oil by the capacity of a large barrel: <fact1>95</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2> = 15.83. Since we can't have a fraction of a barrel, we can use 15 large barrels, but they won't be fully occupied. To fill the remaining space, we can use small barrels. The remaining space is <fact1>95</fact1> - <fact2>15*6</fact2> = 95 - 90 = 5 tons. We can fill this space with 1 small barrel, because <fact3>5</fact3> is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, we should use 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel in total. However, the question asks for the number of large barrels, so the answer is 15."
794,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil.

A large barrel can hold <fact2>6 tons of oil</fact2> and a small barrel can hold <fact3>5 tons of oil</fact3>. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?

Answer: The goal is to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied. To achieve this, we should first use the large barrels as much as possible because they can hold more oil. We can calculate the number of large barrels needed by dividing the total amount of oil by the capacity of a large barrel. The number of large barrels needed is <fact1>95 tons</fact1> / <fact2>6 tons</fact2> = 15.83. Since we can't have a fraction of a barrel, we'll use 15 large barrels. This will occupy 15 * <fact2>6 tons</fact2> = 90 tons of oil. Now, we have 95 - 90 = 5 tons of oil left. We can use small barrels to fill this remaining amount of oil. Since a small barrel can hold <fact3>5 tons of oil</fact3>, we'll need 1 small barrel to fill the remaining 5 tons of oil. Therefore, the total number of small barrels needed is 1."
795,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?","Reformatted Question: A worker needs to cut a <fact1>27-yard long rope</fact1> into some long pieces at <fact2>4 yards each</fact2> and some short pieces at <fact3>1 yard each</fact3>. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?
Answer: The total length of the rope is <fact1>27 yards</fact1>. If we cut the rope into <fact4>x</fact4> long pieces at <fact2>4 yards each</fact2>, the total length of the long pieces will be <fact4>x</fact4> * <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact4>4x</fact4> yards. Since we also want to cut some short pieces at <fact3>1 yard each</fact3>, the total length of the short pieces will be <fact5>y</fact5> * <fact3>1</fact3> = <fact5>y</fact5> yards. The total length of the rope is the sum of the lengths of the long and short pieces, so we have the equation <fact1>27</fact1> = <fact4>4x</fact4> + <fact5>y</fact5>. In order to make the least number of pieces, we want to minimize the total number of pieces, which is <fact4>x</fact4> + <fact5>y</fact5>. Since the total length of the rope is fixed at <fact1>27 yards</fact1>, we want to find the value of <fact4>x</fact4> that minimizes the total number of pieces. One way to do this is to try to find the largest possible value of <fact4>x</fact4> such that <fact4>4x</fact4> is less than or equal to <fact1>27</fact1>. If we try <fact4>x</fact4> = 6, we get <fact4>4x</fact4> = 24, which is less than <fact1>27</fact1>. If we try <fact4>x</fact4> = 7, we get <fact4>4x</fact4> = 28, which is greater than <fact1>27</fact1>. Therefore, the largest possible value of <fact4>x</fact4> is 6. Since we want to minimize the total number of pieces, we should choose <fact4>x</fact4> = 6. The answer is {6}."

In order to make the least number of pieces, how many <fact4>short pieces</fact4> should be cut for?

Answer: To make the least number of pieces, we want to cut as many long pieces as possible. Since the rope is <fact1>27-yard long</fact1> and we can cut <fact2>long pieces at 4 yard each</fact2>, the maximum number of long pieces we can cut is <fact1>27</fact1> // <fact2>4</fact2> = 6. This means we can cut 6 long pieces of 4 yards each, which will take up <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 24 yards of the rope. This leaves us with <fact1>27</fact1> - <fact2>24</fact2> = 3 yards of the rope.

How many portfolios of paintings will be left?,"Reformatted Question: 15 students split <fact1>122 portfolios of paintings</fact1>. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will be left?
Answer: To find out how many portfolios will be left, we first need to find out how many each student will get. There are <fact1>15 students</fact1> and <fact2>122 portfolios</fact2>. To divide the portfolios evenly, we divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students. So each student will get <fact2>122</fact2> / <fact1>15</fact1> = 8.1333 portfolios. Since we can't divide a portfolio into fractions, each student will get 8 portfolios. To find out how many portfolios will be left, we multiply the number of students by the number of portfolios each student will get, and then subtract this number from the total number of portfolios. So, <fact1>15</fact1> * <fact2>8</fact2> = 120. Then, <fact2>122</fact2> - <fact1>120</fact1> = 2. The answer is {2}."

A large truck can load <fact2>15 tons of fruits</fact2> and a small truck can load <fact3>7 tons</fact3>. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?

Answer: First, let's determine the number of large trucks needed to load the fruits. To do this, we can divide the total number of tons of fruits by the number of tons a large truck can load. 

<fact1>134 tons of fruits</fact1> / <fact2>15 tons per large truck</fact2> = 8.9333. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that every truck is fully occupied. 

Therefore, we need to use 9 large trucks to load the fruits."
802,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many small trucks should be used?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Lee wants to load <fact1>134 tons of his fruits</fact1>. A large truck can load <fact2>15 tons of fruits</fact2> and a small truck can load <fact3>7 tons</fact3>. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many small trucks should be used?

Answer: We want to use the least number of trucks, so we should use as many large trucks as possible. The maximum number of large trucks we can use is <fact1>134 tons</fact1> // <fact2>15 tons</fact2> = 8.9, which means we can use 8 large trucks. 8 large trucks can carry 8 * <fact2>15 tons</fact2> = 120 tons. This means we still have <fact1>134 tons</fact1> - 120 tons = 14 tons left. Since we want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, we should use small trucks to carry the remaining 14 tons. The maximum number of small trucks we can use is 14 // <fact3>7 tons</fact3> = 2. So, we should use 2 small trucks. The answer is {2}."
803,"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon did Sam make?","Reformatted Question: Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a <fact1>3,730-cm long ribbon</fact1>. If each piece was <fact2>73 cm long</fact2>, how many <fact3>73 cm pieces of ribbon</fact3> did Sam make?
Answer: To find the number of <fact3>73 cm pieces of ribbon</fact3> Sam made, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. The total length of the ribbon is <fact1>3,730 cm</fact1> and the length of each piece is <fact2>73 cm</fact2>. So, the number of pieces is <fact1>3,730 cm</fact1> / <fact2>73 cm</fact2> = 51. 

Note: The division result is a whole number because the remainder is 0. This is due to the fact that 3,730 is exactly divisible by 73."
804,"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?","Reformatted Question: Sam cut <fact1>equal-length pieces</fact1> of ribbon from a <fact2>3,730-cm long</fact2> ribbon. If each piece was <fact3>73 cm long</fact3>, how much of the original ribbon was left?

Answer: Sam cut <fact1>equal-length pieces</fact1> of ribbon, which means all the pieces are the same length. Each piece is <fact3>73 cm long</fact3>. To find out how many pieces he cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. The total length of the ribbon is <fact2>3,730 cm</fact2>. So, the number of pieces is <fact2>3,730 cm</fact2> / <fact3>73 cm</fact3> = 51. 

Since each piece is <fact3>73 cm long</fact3>, the total length of all the pieces is 51 * <fact3>73 cm</fact3> = 3731 cm. To find out how much of the original ribbon was left, we need to subtract the total length of all the pieces from the original length of the ribbon. The original length of the ribbon is <fact2>3,730 cm</fact2>, so the length of the ribbon left is <fact2>3,730 cm</fact2> - 3731 cm = 99 cm. The answer is {99}."
805,"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?","Reformatted Question: A tourist group has <fact1>26 people</fact1>.

In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?

Answer: The tourist group has <fact1>26 people</fact1> and they want to rent large rooms for <fact2>3 people each</fact2>. To find the least number of large rooms to rent, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each large room. However, since we can't rent a fraction of a room, we will round up to the nearest whole number if there is any remainder. 

<fact1>26 people</fact1> divided by <fact2>3 people per room</fact2> is <fact1>26</fact1> / <fact2>3</fact2> = 8.6666... Since we can't rent a fraction of a room, we round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need to rent at least 9 large rooms to accommodate all 26 people."

In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?
Answer: We want to rent the least number of rooms. The large rooms can hold <fact2>3 people each</fact2>, so we can divide <fact1>26 people</fact1> by <fact2>3</fact2> to see how many large rooms we need. However, we can't rent a fraction of a room, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 26 / 3 = 8.67, so we need 9 large rooms. This will take up 9 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 27 people. We have 26 people in total, so we can't rent 9 large rooms. We'll rent as many large rooms as we can, which is 8 large rooms. This will take up 8 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 24 people. We have 2 people left. Since the small rooms can hold <fact3>2 people each</fact3>, we can put these 2 people in 1 small room. Therefore, we need to rent 1 small room."
807,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Lee harvested <fact1>495 apples</fact1> and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are <fact2>25 apples</fact2> in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?
Answer: To find the number of baskets, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket. This is because the baskets are packed evenly, so the number of apples in each basket is the same. We can use the division operation to find the number of baskets. The number of apples in each basket is <fact2>25</fact2>, and the total number of apples is <fact1>495</fact1>. Therefore, the number of baskets is <fact1>495</fact1> ÷ <fact2>25</fact2> = 19.8. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a basket, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of baskets of apples is 19."
808,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many apples were left unpacked?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Lee harvested <fact1>495 apples</fact1> and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are <fact2>25 apples in each basket</fact2>, how many apples were left unpacked?
Answer: Mr. Lee had <fact1>495 apples</fact1> to pack. He packed them evenly in baskets with <fact2>25 apples in each basket</fact2>. To find out how many baskets he could pack, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket. This can be calculated as <fact1>495</fact1> ÷ <fact2>25</fact2> = 19.8. Since we cannot have a fraction of a basket, this means Mr. Lee could pack <fact3>19 baskets</fact3> with <fact4>25 apples in each basket</fact4>. To find the total number of apples packed, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of apples per basket: <fact3>19</fact3> * <fact2>25</fact2> = 475 apples. To find the number of apples left unpacked, we can subtract the total number of apples packed from the total number of apples harvested: <fact1>495</fact1> - <fact5>475</fact5> = 20 apples. The answer is {20}."
809,"A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each.

In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?

Answer: In order to make the least number of groups, we need to make the most number of large groups possible. Since the number of members in the class is <fact1>90</fact1>, and each large group has <fact2>7 members</fact2>, we can divide <fact1>90</fact1> by <fact2>7</fact2> to find the maximum number of large groups. This is <fact1>90</fact1> ÷ <fact2>7</fact2> = 12.85714286. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is <fact4>12</fact4>. The answer is {12}."

In order to make the least number of groups, how many small groups should be made?
Answer: In order to make the least number of groups, we need to find the largest possible number of large groups. The number of large groups is determined by <fact1>90 members</fact1> divided by <fact2>7 members each</fact2>, which is <fact1>90</fact1> ÷ <fact2>7</fact2> = 12.85 (round down to 12 since we can't have a fraction of a group). This means we can make 12 large groups. The remaining members are <fact1>90</fact1> - 12 * <fact2>7</fact2> = 90 - 84 = 6. Since we want to make the least number of groups, we should make as many small groups as possible. The number of small groups is determined by the remaining members, which is <fact3>6</fact3> ÷ <fact3>3</fact3> = 2. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can make 2 small groups."

If there were <fact2>65 ml of tea</fact2> in each cup, how many cups were filled with tea?

Answer: Since there were <fact2>65 ml of tea</fact2> in each cup, the number of cups filled with tea must be the total amount of tea divided by the amount in each cup. The total amount of tea is <fact1>1,050 ml</fact1>. The amount in each cup is <fact2>65 ml</fact2>. So the number of cups is <fact1>1,050 ml</fact1> / <fact2>65 ml</fact2> = 16.15.

813,There are 250 vitamins in a bottle. Gil takes 12 vitamins per day. How many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins is Gil on the day the bottle runs out?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>250 vitamins</fact1> in a bottle. <fact2>Gil takes 12 vitamins per day</fact2>. How many vitamins short of his usual <fact3>12 vitamins</fact3> is <fact4>Gil on the day the bottle runs out</fact4>?

Answer: There are <fact1>250 vitamins</fact1> in the bottle. <fact2>Gil takes 12 vitamins per day</fact2>. This means the bottle will run out when <fact1>250</fact1> / <fact2>12</fact2> = 20.83 days. Since <fact1>20.83</fact1> is not a whole number, we can assume the bottle runs out on the 21st day. On the 21st day, <fact2>Gil will take 12 vitamins</fact2>, but there are not enough vitamins left in the bottle. The number of vitamins left in the bottle is <fact1>250</fact1> - 12 * 20 = 250 - 240 = 10 vitamins. Therefore, <fact4>Gil is 2 vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins</fact4> on the day the bottle runs out. The answer is {2}."

If the farmer wanted to fill <fact2>17 cages</fact2> with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?
Answer: If the farmer wants to fill <fact2>17 cages</fact2> with the same number of rabbits, then each cage should have the same number of rabbits. Since the farmer bought <fact1>164 rabbits</fact1> and wants to put them in <fact2>17 cages</fact2>, we need to divide the total number of rabbits by the number of cages. This is <fact1>164</fact1> ÷ <fact2>17</fact2> = 9.64. Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, the farmer should have 10 rabbits in each cage. To find out how many more rabbits the farmer should buy, we need to multiply the number of cages by the number of rabbits in each cage and subtract the total number of rabbits the farmer already has.

If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, at least how many more lollipops are needed?
Answer: To find out how many lollipops each kid will get, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of kids. So, we have <fact1>650</fact1> lollipops and <fact2>42 kids</fact2>. If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, each kid will get <fact1>650</fact1> / <fact2>42</fact2> = 15.48 lollipops. Since we can't divide a lollipop into fractions, each kid will get at least 15 lollipops. To find out how many lollipops are needed in total, we multiply the number of kids by the number of lollipops each kid gets: <fact2>42 kids</fact2> * 15 lollipops = 630 lollipops. We already have <fact1>650</fact1> lollipops, so we need at least <fact1>650</fact1> - 630 = 20 more lollipops. The answer is {20}."

If she wants to fill <fact2>10 boxes</fact2> with the same number of tarts, how many more tarts should she make?
Answer: To find the number of tarts Mrs. Dalloway should make, we need to divide the number of boxes by the number of tarts per box. Since we don't know the number of tarts per box, we will assume it is x. So, we have 10 boxes and x tarts per box. In total, she will have 10x tarts. Since she wants to fill 10 boxes, we can set up the equation 10x = 85. However, we are asked to find out how many more tarts she should make, not the number of tarts per box. So, we need to find the remainder of the division of 85 by 10. The remainder will be the number of tarts she should make. 85 ÷ 10 = 8 remainder 5. So, she should make 5 more tarts. The answer is {5}."

If it wants to shelve them equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>, how many more new books should be purchased?
Answer: To find out how many books the library can shelve equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>, we need to divide the total number of books, which is <fact1>4,305</fact1>, by the number of shelves, which is <fact2>83</fact2>. The number of books that can be shelve equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2> is <fact1>4,305</fact1> / <fact2>83</fact2> = 52. 

However, since we are trying to find out how many more books should be purchased, we need to check if 52 books can be equally distributed onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>. Since 52 books can be evenly distributed onto 83 shelves (52 * 83 = 4,326, which is not a multiple of 83, so it is not possible to evenly distribute 4,326 books onto 83 shelves), we need to find the maximum number of books that can be evenly distributed onto 83 shelves. The maximum number of books that can be evenly distributed onto 83 shelves is 51 books per shelf (51 * 83 = 4,233, which is a multiple of 83).

Since the library has <fact1>4,305</fact1> books and each shelf can hold <fact2>51 books</fact2>, the total number of books that can be shelve equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2> is <fact1>4,305</fact1> / <fact2>83</fact2> * <fact2>51</fact2> = 4,305 / 83 * 51 = 2595."

If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, how many more bureaus are needed at least?

Answer: If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, then we need to divide the total number of bureaus by the number of offices. There are <fact1>88 bureaus</fact1> in total and <fact2>14 offices</fact2>. We need to divide <fact1>88</fact1> by <fact2>14</fact2> to find out how many bureaus each office should get. <fact1>88</fact1> ÷ <fact2>14</fact2> = 6.33, which means each office should get at least 6 bureaus. Now, we need to find out how many bureaus are needed in total for 14 offices. If each office should get 6 bureaus, then we need <fact2>14</fact2> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 84 bureaus. We already have <fact1>88</fact1> bureaus, so we need to find out how many more bureaus are needed at least. We need <fact1>88</fact1> - <fact3>84</fact3> = 4 more bureaus. The answer is {4}."

If she wants to make <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2> with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?

Answer: To find out how many more beads Betty needs, we first need to determine how many beads she will use for each necklace. Since she wants to make <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2> with the same number of beads, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces. This will give us the number of beads for each necklace. The number of beads for each necklace is <fact1>367 beads</fact1> / <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2> = 24.47. However, since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we will round down to 24 beads per necklace. Now, we need to find out how many beads she will use in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces. The total number of beads used is 24 * 15 = 360. To find out how many more beads she needs, we subtract the total number of beads used from the total number of beads she has. The number of beads she needs is <fact1>367 beads</fact1> - 360 = 7. The answer is {7}."

If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?
Answer: To find out how many more pudding cups are needed, we need to divide the total number of pudding cups by the number of students. This will give us the minimum number of cups each student should get. If we divide <fact1>315 cups</fact1> by <fact2>218 students</fact2>, we get 1.446 (approximately). Since we can't give a fraction of a cup, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means each student should get at least 2 cups. To find out how many cups are needed in total, we multiply the number of students by the number of cups each student should get: <fact2>218 students</fact2> * 2 = 436 cups. Since we already have <fact1>315 cups</fact1>, we need at least 436 - <fact1>315</fact1> = 121 more cups. The answer is {121}."

Answer: The school bought <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1> and wants to distribute them equally into <fact2>35 classrooms</fact2>. To find out how many chairs each classroom should have, we need to divide the total number of chairs by the number of classrooms. The number of chairs each classroom should have is <fact1>1,093</fact1> ÷ <fact2>35</fact2> = 31. This means each classroom should have 31 chairs. To find out how many chairs the school actually has, we need to multiply the number of chairs each classroom should have by the number of classrooms. The total number of chairs the school actually has is <fact2>35</fact2> * 31 = 1,075. Since the school bought <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1> and it needs <fact2>1,075</fact2> chairs, it should purchase <fact1>1,093</fact1> - <fact2>1,075</fact2> = 18 more chairs. The answer is {18}."
831,The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>2 bags of chips</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>5 such bags of chips</fact3> and <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact5>2 kg 200 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a <fact6>bag of chips</fact6> than a <fact7>bottle of juice</fact7>?

Answer: We know that the weight of <fact1>2 bags of chips</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>. So the weight of <fact6>1 bag of chips</fact6> is <fact2>800 g</fact2> / <fact8>2</fact8> = <fact9>400 g</fact9>. The total weight of <fact3>5 such bags of chips</fact3> and <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact5>2 kg 200 g</fact5>, which is equal to <fact10>2200 g</fact10>. The weight of <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3> is <fact11>5</fact11> * <fact9>400 g</fact9> = <fact12>2000 g</fact12>. So the weight of <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact10>2200 g</fact10> - <fact12>2000 g</fact12> = <fact13>200 g</fact13>. Now we can see that a <fact6>bag of chips</fact6> is <fact14>200 g</fact14> - <fact13>200 g</fact13> = <fact15>0 g</fact15> g heavier than a <fact7>bottle of juice</fact7>."
832,The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>5 diamonds</fact1> is <fact2>100 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> and <fact4>2 jades</fact4> is <fact5>140 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a <fact6>jade</fact6> than a <fact7>diamond</fact7>?

Answer: We are given the weight of <fact1>5 diamonds</fact1>, which is <fact2>100 g</fact2>. We can find the weight of one diamond by dividing the total weight by the number of diamonds: <fact2>100 g</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = <fact8>20 g</fact8>. We are also given the total weight of <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> and <fact4>2 jades</fact4>, which is <fact5>140 g</fact5>. To find the total weight of the <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3>, we can multiply the weight of one diamond by the number of diamonds: <fact8>20 g</fact8> * <fact1>4</fact1> = <fact9>80 g</fact9>. Now we can find the total weight of the <fact4>2 jades</fact4> by subtracting the total weight of the <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> from the total weight: <fact5>140 g</fact5> - <fact9>80 g</fact9> = <fact10>60 g</fact10>. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide the total weight of the <fact4>2 jades</fact4> by the number of jades: <fact10>60 g</fact10> / <fact1>2</fact1> = <fact11>30 g</fact11>. Finally, we can find the difference in weight between a <fact6>jade</fact6> and a <fact7>diamond</fact7> by subtracting the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade: <fact11>30 g</fact11> - <fact8>20 g</fact8> = <fact12>10 g</fact12>."
833,The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg.

The total weight of <fact3>2 single beds</fact3> and <fact4>4 double beds</fact4> is <fact5>100 kg</fact5>. How much heavier is a <fact6>double bed</fact6> than a <fact7>single bed</fact7>?

Answer: Let's start with the weight of the single beds. We know that the weight of <fact1>5 single beds</fact1> is <fact2>50 kg</fact2>. This means that the weight of one single bed is <fact2>50 kg</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 10 kg. Now, let's consider the total weight of <fact3>2 single beds</fact3> and <fact4>4 double beds</fact4>, which is <fact5>100 kg</fact5>. The weight of <fact3>2 single beds</fact3> is 2 * 10 kg = 20 kg. Therefore, the weight of <fact4>4 double beds</fact4> is <fact5>100 kg</fact5> - 20 kg = 80 kg. This means that the weight of one double bed is 80 kg / 4 = 20 kg. Now, we can find the difference in weight between a double bed and a single bed by subtracting the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed: 20 kg - 10 kg = 10 kg."
834,The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g.

The total weight of <fact3>4 glass bottles</fact3> and <fact4>5 plastic bottles</fact4> is <fact5>1 kg 50 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a <fact6>glass bottle</fact6> than a <fact7>plastic bottle</fact7>?
Answer: The weight of <fact1>3 glass bottles</fact1> is <fact2>600 g</fact2>. This means the weight of <fact6>1 glass bottle</fact6> is <fact2>600 g</fact2> / <fact8>3</fact8> = 200 g. The total weight of <fact3>4 glass bottles</fact3> and <fact4>5 plastic bottles</fact4> is <fact5>1 kg 50 g</fact5>, which is <fact9>1050 g</fact9>. The weight of <fact3>4 glass bottles</fact3> is <fact10>4</fact10> * <fact2>200 g</fact2> = 800 g. So the weight of <fact4>5 plastic bottles</fact4> is <fact11>1050 g</fact11> - <fact12>800 g</fact12> = 250 g. The weight of <fact4>1 plastic bottle</fact4> is <fact13>250 g</fact13> / <fact14>5</fact14> = 50 g. The weight difference between a <fact6>glass bottle</fact6> and a <fact7>plastic bottle</fact7> is <fact2>200 g</fact2> - <fact13>50 g</fact13> = 150 g. The answer is {150}."
835,The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>5 foxes</fact1> is <fact2>25 kg</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>3 foxes and 5 dogs</fact3> is <fact4>65 kg</fact4>. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of a single fox. The weight of <fact1>5 foxes</fact1> is <fact2>25 kg</fact2>, so the weight of a single fox is <fact2>25 kg</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = <fact2>5 kg</fact2>. 

Next, we need to find the weight of a single dog. The total weight of <fact3>3 foxes and 5 dogs</fact3> is <fact4>65 kg</fact4>. Since the weight of <fact1>3 foxes</fact1> is <fact2>3 * 5 = 15 kg</fact2>, the weight of the <fact3>5 dogs</fact3> is <fact4>65 kg</fact4> - <fact2>15 kg</fact2> = <fact4>50 kg</fact4>. The weight of a single dog is <fact4>50 kg</fact4> / <fact3>5</fact3> = <fact4>10 kg</fact4>. 

Finally, we can find the difference in weight between a dog and a fox. The weight of a dog is <fact4>10 kg</fact4> and the weight of a fox is <fact2>5 kg</fact2>, so a dog is <fact4>10 kg</fact4> - <fact2>5 kg</fact2> = <fact5>5 kg</fact5> heavier than a fox. The answer is {5}."

Answer: The weight of <fact1>4 watermelons</fact1> is <fact2>5 kg 200 g</fact2>. This means that the weight of <fact6>one watermelon</fact6> is <fact2>5 kg 200 g</fact2> / <fact1>4</fact1> = <fact8>1 kg 300 g</fact8>. The total weight of <fact3>3 such watermelons</fact3> and <fact4>4 pineapples</fact4> is <fact5>5 kg 700 g</fact5>. This means that the weight of <fact3>3 watermelons</fact3> and <fact4>4 pineapples</fact4> is <fact5>5 kg 700 g</fact5>. Since we know the weight of <fact3>3 watermelons</fact3> is <fact9>3 * 1 kg 300 g</fact9> = <fact10>3 kg 900 g</fact10>, the weight of <fact4>4 pineapples</fact4> is <fact5>5 kg 700 g</fact5> - <fact10>3 kg 900 g</fact10> = <fact11>1 kg 800 g</fact11>.

837,The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g. How much heavier is a cake than a piece of bread?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>4 cakes</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> and <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is <fact5>1 kg 100 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a <fact6>cake</fact6> than a <fact7>piece of bread</fact7>?

Answer: First, let's find the weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3>. Since the weight of <fact1>4 cakes</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>, the weight of <fact3>1 cake</fact3> is <fact2>800 g</fact2> / <fact3>4</fact3> = <fact8>200 g</fact8>. Therefore, the weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> is <fact8>200 g</fact8> * <fact3>3</fact3> = <fact9>600 g</fact9>. 

Now, let's convert <fact5>1 kg 100 g</fact5> to grams. Since <fact5>1 kg</fact5> is <fact10>1000 g</fact10>, <fact5>1 kg 100 g</fact5> is <fact10>1000 g</fact10> + <fact11>100 g</fact11> = <fact12>1100 g</fact12>. 

The total weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> and <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is <fact12>1100 g</fact12>, and the weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> is <fact9>600 g</fact9>. Therefore, the weight of <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is <fact12>1100 g</fact12> - <fact9>600 g</fact9> = <fact13>500 g</fact13>. 

Now, let's find the weight of <fact7>1 piece of bread</fact7>. Since the weight of <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is <fact13>500 g</fact13>, the weight of <fact7>1 piece of bread</fact7> is <fact13>500 g</fact13> / <fact4>5</fact4> = <fact14>100 g</fact14>. 

Finally, let's find the difference between the weight of <fact6>1 cake</fact6> and the weight of <fact7>1 piece of bread</fact7>. The weight of <fact6>1 cake</fact6> is <fact8>200 g</fact8> and the weight of <fact7>1 piece of bread</fact7> is <fact14>100 g</fact14>. Therefore, the weight difference is <fact8>200 g</fact8> - <fact14>100 g</fact14> = <fact15>100 g</fact15>.

If the number of boys is 12, find the number of girls.","Reformatted Question: The ratio of <fact1>boys to girls</fact1> in a <fact2>kindergarten</fact2> is <fact3>2:3</fact3>. If the number of <fact4>boys</fact4> is <fact5>12</fact5>, find the number of <fact6>girls</fact6>.

Answer: The ratio of <fact1>boys to girls</fact1> is <fact3>2:3</fact3>. This means that for every 2 <fact4>boys</fact4>, there are 3 <fact6>girls</fact6>. Since the number of <fact4>boys</fact4> is <fact5>12</fact5>, we can set up a proportion to find the number of <fact6>girls</fact6>. Let's say the number of <fact6>girls</fact6> is x. We can set up the proportion: 2/3 = 12/x. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 3(12). This simplifies to 2x = 36. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 18. Therefore, the number of <fact6>girls</fact6> is 18. The answer is {18}."

The ratio of <fact2>good oranges to the bad oranges</fact2> is <fact3>3:1</fact3>, find the number of <fact4>bad oranges</fact4>.

Answer: We are given that the ratio of <fact2>good oranges to the bad oranges</fact2> is <fact3>3:1</fact3>. This means for every 3 good oranges, there is 1 bad orange. Let's assume the number of good oranges is 3x and the number of bad oranges is x. We are given that there are <fact1>24 good oranges</fact1>, so we can set up the equation 3x = 24 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 24 / 3 = 8. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of bad oranges by multiplying x by 1 (since the ratio is 3:1). So, the number of bad oranges is 8 * 1 = 8. The answer is {8}."

The ratio of <fact3>red balls to white balls</fact3> is <fact4>4:5</fact4>. Find the number of <fact5>white balls</fact5>.

Answer: Since the ratio of <fact3>red balls to white balls</fact3> is <fact4>4:5</fact4>, this means that for every <fact4>4</fact4> red balls, there are <fact4>5</fact4> white balls. Let's say there are <fact4>4</fact4> groups of red balls and white balls. In each group, there are <fact1>4 red balls</fact1> and <fact2>5 white balls</fact2>. So, in <fact4>4</fact4> groups, there are <fact4>4</fact4> * <fact1>4</fact1> = <fact6>16</fact6> red balls. This means that there are <fact4>4</fact4> groups in total. Since there are <fact6>16</fact6> red balls in <fact4>4</fact4> groups, the total number of balls in <fact4>4</fact4> groups is <fact6>16</fact6> + <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact4>4</fact4> = <fact6>16</fact6> + <fact7>20</fact7> = <fact8>36</fact8> balls. Since there are <fact8>36</fact8> balls in total, and <fact6>16</fact6> of them are red, the number of white balls is <fact8>36</fact8> - <fact6>16</fact6> = <fact9>20</fact9> white balls."

The distance travelled by <fact3>Ben</fact3> is <fact4>18 miles</fact4>. Find the distance travelled by <fact5>Tim</fact5>.

Answer: The ratio of the distance travelled by <fact1>Ben and Tim</fact1> is <fact2>3:4</fact2>. This means that for every 3 miles travelled by <fact3>Ben</fact3>, <fact5>Tim</fact5> travels 4 miles. We know that <fact3>Ben</fact3> travelled <fact4>18 miles</fact4>. To find out how many sets of 3 miles are in 18 miles, we divide 18 by 3, which gives us 6. This means that <fact3>Ben</fact3> travelled 6 sets of 3 miles. Since the ratio is 3:4, <fact5>Tim</fact5> must have travelled 4 times as many miles as <fact3>Ben</fact3> in each set. Therefore, <fact5>Tim</fact5> travelled 4 * 6 = 24 miles. The answer is {24}."

Answer: Let's denote the number of people in the bus when Jose got on as x. We know that at the next bus stop, <fact1>5 people got on</fact1> and <fact2>2 people got off</fact2>. This means the number of people in the bus after this stop is x + 5 - 2 = x + 3. Two stops later, <fact3>7 people got on</fact3> and <fact4>15 people got off</fact4>. So, the number of people in the bus after this stop is (x + 3) + 7 - 15 = x - 5. Since we are looking for the number of people when Jose got on the bus, we need to find the value of x.

If you want to have the same number of each item for a party, what is the least number of packages of each you need to buy?","Reformatted Question: Cups are sold <fact1>5 to a package</fact1> and plates are sold <fact2>10 to a package</fact2>. If you want to have the same number of each item for a party, what is the least number of packages of each you need to buy?

Answer: We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 10. To do this, we can list the multiples of each number:

Without mixing the fruit, what is the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket?","Reformatted Question: Mei has <fact1>15 oranges</fact1>, <fact2>9 peaches</fact2> and <fact3>18 pears</fact3>. She wants to put all of the fruit into baskets with each basket having the same number of pieces of fruit in it. Without mixing the fruit, what is the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket?
Answer: To find the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each type of fruit. The GCD of <fact1>15 oranges</fact1>, <fact2>9 peaches</fact2> and <fact3>18 pears</fact3> is the largest number that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder. 

We can start by finding the prime factors of each number: 
- <fact1>15 oranges</fact1> = 3 * 5
- <fact2>9 peaches</fact2> = 3^2
- <fact3>18 pears</fact3> = 2 * 3^2

The common factors are 3^2 = 9. Therefore, the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket is 9."
870,"At the gym, Hillary swims every 6 days, runs every 4 days and cycles every 16 days. If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?","Reformatted Question: At the gym, Hillary swims every <fact1>6 days</fact1>, runs every <fact2>4 days</fact2> and cycles every <fact3>16 days</fact3>. If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?
Answer: To find the number of days when she will do all three activities again on the same day, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 4, and 16. 

First, let's find the prime factors of each number:
- 6 = 2 * 3
- 4 = 2 * 2
- 16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

Now, let's find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^4 (from 16)
- The highest power of 3 is 3^1 (from 6)

So, the LCM is 2^4 * 3^1 = 16 * 3 = 48.

Therefore, Hillary will do all three activities again on the same day in 48 days. The answer is {48}."

873,"A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?","Reformatted Question: A full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>. If the last full moon occurred on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a <fact3>Friday</fact3>?

Answer: A full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>. Since the last full moon occurred on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>, we need to find the next <fact2>Friday</fact2> after that. To do this, we need to find the number of days it takes to reach the next <fact2>Friday</fact2> from the current <fact2>Friday</fact2>. This can be done by counting the number of days in a week, which is <fact4>7 days</fact4>. However, since a full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>, we need to find the number of days it takes to reach the next <fact1>30</fact1> days from the current <fact2>Friday</fact2>. This can be done by dividing <fact1>30</fact1> by <fact4>7</fact4>, which is approximately <fact5>4.29</fact5>. However, since we are counting days, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is <fact6>5</fact6>. Therefore, it will take <fact6>5</fact6> days to reach the next <fact2>Friday</fact2> after the current <fact2>Friday</fact2>. However, since a full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>, we need to find the number of days it takes to reach the next full moon after the current full moon. This can be done by subtracting the number of days it takes to reach the next <fact2>Friday</fact2> from the current <fact2>Friday</fact2> from the total number of days in a full moon cycle, which is <fact1>30</fact1>. Therefore, the number of days it will take to reach the next full moon after the current full moon is <fact1>30</fact1> - <fact6>5</fact6> = <fact7>25</fact7> days. The answer is {25}."

The number <fact4>35</fact4> came out of the machine. What number did I put in?
Answer: Let's call the number that I put in <fact1>a</fact1>. The machine added <fact2>15</fact2> to <fact1>a</fact1>, so the result is <fact1>a</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2>. Then, the machine subtracted <fact3>6</fact3> from the result, so the final result is (<fact1>a</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2>) - <fact3>6</fact3>. We are told that the final result is <fact4>35</fact4>, so we can set up the equation (<fact1>a</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2>) - <fact3>6</fact3> = <fact4>35</fact4>. To solve for <fact1>a</fact1>, we can add <fact3>6</fact3> to both sides of the equation, which gives us <fact1>a</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2> = <fact4>35</fact4> + <fact3>6</fact3>. This simplifies to <fact1>a</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2> = <fact5>41</fact5>. To isolate <fact1>a</fact1>, we can subtract <fact2>15</fact2> from both sides of the equation, which gives us <fact1>a</fact1> = <fact5>41</fact5> - <fact2>15</fact2>. This simplifying this, we get <fact1>a</fact1> = <fact6>26</fact6>. Therefore, the number that I put in was <fact6>26</fact6>."

Greg ate <fact1>4 halves</fact1> and his brother, Brad, had <fact2>6 halves</fact2>. There were <fact3>18 halves</fact3> left. How many whole cookies did Greg's mom make?

Answer: Greg's mom made some cookies and she cut them in half. There were <fact3>18 halves</fact3> left. If she cut them in half, that means there were originally <fact3>18</fact3> * 2 = 36 halves. Since there were <fact1>4 halves</fact1> eaten by Greg and <fact2>6 halves</fact2> eaten by Brad, they ate <fact1>4</fact1> + <fact2>6</fact2> = 10 halves. That means there were 36 - <fact1>4</fact1> - <fact2>6</fact2> = 26 halves eaten. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of whole cookies. To find that, we need to divide the total number of halves by 2. The total number of halves is 36. So, the number of whole cookies is 36 / 2 = 18. The answer is {18}."
887,Eric has two pieces of rope. One piece is 10 inches longer than the other. The total length of the two pieces is 40 inches.

The total length of the two pieces is <fact3>40 inches</fact3>. How long is the shorter piece?

Answer: Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since one piece is 10 inches longer than the other, the length of the longer piece is x + 10. The total length of the two pieces is 40 inches, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) = 40. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 10 = 40. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 30. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 15. Therefore, the shorter piece is 15 inches long."

How many dimes does Anna have?
Answer: Let's use <fact2>8 fewer nickels than dimes</fact2> to set up an equation. If we let d be the number of dimes, then the number of nickels is d - 8. The total number of coins is 28, so we can write the equation d + (d - 8) = 28. Combining like terms, we get 2d - 8 = 28. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 2d = 36. Dividing both sides by 2, we get d = 18. So, Anna has 18 dimes."

To find out how many more <fact1>stickers</fact1> Dan has than Cindy now, we need to compare the number of <fact1>stickers</fact1> Dan has now with the number of <fact1>stickers</fact1> Cindy has now. Since Dan has <fact3>18</fact3> more <fact1>stickers</fact1> than he had initially and Cindy has <fact1>stickers</fact1> left, we can conclude that Dan has <fact3>18</fact3> more <fact1>stickers</fact1> than Cindy now."
893,Rick and Todd have the same number of candy bars. Rick ate 11 candy bars. Todd gave away 18 of his candy bars. How many more candy bars did Rick have than Todd then?,"Reformatted Question: Rick and Todd have the same number of <fact1>candy bars</fact1>. Rick ate <fact2>11 candy bars</fact2>. Todd gave away <fact3>18 of his candy bars</fact3>. How many more <fact1>candy bars</fact1> did Rick have than Todd then?

Answer: Rick had the same number of <fact1>candy bars</fact1> as Todd, but then Rick ate <fact2>11 candy bars</fact2> and Todd gave away <fact3>18 of his candy bars</fact3>. This means that Rick had <fact2>11 candy bars</fact2> less than he started with, while Todd had <fact3>18 candy bars</fact3> less than he started with. Since Rick and Todd started with the same number of <fact1>candy bars</fact1>, the difference in the number of <fact1>candy bars</fact1> they had after the events is the difference between the number of <fact2>candy bars</fact2> Rick ate and the number of <fact3>candy bars</fact3> Todd gave away, which is <fact2>11</fact2> - <fact3>18</fact3> = -7. This means that Rick had 7 more <fact1>candy bars</fact1> than Todd then."
894,Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. How many more marble did Ed have than Doug then?,"Reformatted Question: Ed had <fact1>22 more marbles</fact1> than Doug. Doug lost <fact2>8 of his marbles</fact2> at the playground. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
Answer: We know that Ed had <fact1>22 more marbles</fact1> than Doug. This means that initially, Ed had <fact1>22</fact1> + Doug's marbles. Since Doug lost <fact2>8 of his marbles</fact2>, he now has Doug's marbles - <fact2>8</fact2>. We need to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now. To do that, we need to subtract Doug's marbles - <fact2>8</fact2> from Ed's marbles. Since Ed had <fact1>22 more marbles</fact1> than Doug, we can represent Ed's marbles as Doug's marbles + <fact1>22</fact1>. So, the difference between Ed's marbles and Doug's marbles now is (Doug's marbles + <fact1>22</fact1>) - (Doug's marbles - <fact2>8</fact2>). The <fact1>22</fact1> and -<fact2>8</fact2> cancel out, leaving us with <fact1>22</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2> = 30. The answer is {30}."
895,Sara bought decorations for her party. She paid $5 for balloons and $18 for tablecloths. She also spent $9 for streamers. She paid the cashier and got $8 back. How much money did Sara give to the cashier?,"Reformatted Question: Sara bought decorations for her party. She paid <fact1>$5 for balloons</fact1> and <fact2>$18 for tablecloths</fact2>. She also spent <fact3>$9 for streamers</fact3>. She paid the cashier and got <fact4>$8 back</fact4>. How much money did Sara give to the cashier?
Answer: Sara paid <fact1>$5 for balloons</fact1>, <fact2>$18 for tablecloths</fact2>, and <fact3>$9 for streamers</fact3>. To find out how much she paid in total, we need to add these amounts together. So, the total amount she paid is <fact1>$5</fact1> + <fact2>$18</fact2> + <fact3>$9</fact3> = $32. She also got <fact4>$8 back</fact4>. Therefore, the amount she gave to the cashier is $32 - <fact4>$8</fact4> = $24. The answer is {24}."
896,"Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans. On the second day, he found 9 cans. He found 14 cans on the third day. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?","Reformatted Question: Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the <fact1>first day</fact1>, he found <fact2>4 cans</fact2>. On the <fact3>second day</fact3>, he found <fact4>9 cans</fact4>. He found <fact5>14 cans</fact5> on the <fact6>third day</fact6>. If this <fact7>pattern continues</fact7>, how many cans do you think Zachary will find on the <fact8>seventh day</fact8>?

Answer: The pattern of the number of cans Zachary finds each day is increasing. On the <fact1>first day</fact1>, he found <fact2>4 cans</fact2>. On the <fact3>second day</fact3>, he found <fact4>9 cans</fact4>, which is <fact4>9</fact4> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 5 more cans than the first day. On the <fact6>third day</fact6>, he found <fact5>14 cans</fact5>, which is <fact5>14</fact5> - <fact4>9</fact4> = 5 more cans than the second day. This means that the number of cans he finds each day is increasing by 5. To find the number of cans he will find on the <fact8>seventh day</fact8>, we need to add 5 to the number of cans he found on the <fact6>third day</fact6> 4 times (since there are 4 days between the <fact6>third day</fact6> and the <fact8>seventh day</fact8>). The number of cans he will find on the <fact8>seventh day</fact8> is <fact5>14</fact5> + 5 * 4 = <fact5>14</fact5> + 20 = 34. The answer is {34}."
897,Suzanne read the first 15 pages of her book on Monday. She read 16 more pages than that on Tuesday. Then there were 18 pages left.

She read <fact3>16 more pages than that</fact3> on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>. Then there were <fact5>18 pages left</fact5>. How many pages are in Suzanne's book altogether?

Answer: Suzanne read <fact1>15 pages</fact1> on <fact2>Monday</fact2>. She read <fact3>16 more pages than that</fact3> on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>, so she read 15 + 16 = 31 pages on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>. She read a total of 15 + 31 = 46 pages. Then there were <fact5>18 pages left</fact5>. So the total number of pages in Suzanne's book is 46 + 18 = 64 pages. The answer is {64}."

They want to buy their mom a coat that costs <fact3>$80</fact3>. How much more money do they need?

Answer: Maria has <fact1>$17</fact1> and her sister has <fact2>double that amount</fact2>, which means her sister has 2 * <fact1>$17</fact1> = $34. So in total they have <fact1>$17</fact1> + $34 = $51. They want to buy a coat that costs <fact3>$80</fact3>, so they need <fact3>$80</fact3> - $51 = $29 more. The answer is {29}."
899,Tina had a large collection of beanie babies. She gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin. She gave half that amount to her sister. She gave 36 beanie babies to needy children. She kept 12 for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?,"Reformatted Question: Tina had a large collection of <fact1>beanie babies</fact1>.

She kept <fact5>12 for herself</fact5>. How many <fact1>beanie babies</fact1> were in Tina's collection at first?

Answer: Tina gave <fact2>8 beanie babies</fact2> to her cousin. She gave <fact3>half that amount</fact3> to her sister. This means she gave <fact3>8/2 = 4</fact3> beanie babies to her sister. In total, she gave away <fact2>8</fact2> + <fact3>4</fact3> = 12 beanie babies. She gave <fact4>36 beanie babies</fact4> to needy children. So in total, she gave away 12 + <fact4>36</fact4> = 48 beanie babies. She kept <fact5>12 for herself</fact5>. Therefore, she had <fact5>12</fact5> + 48 = 60 beanie babies at first.

Answer: David spent <fact1>74 cents</fact1> in total. He bought a <fact2>ruler</fact2> for <fact3>29 cents</fact3> and a <fact4>folder</fact4> for <fact5>25 cents</fact5>. This means he spent <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact5>25</fact5> = <fact7>54 cents</fact7> on the ruler and folder. Since he spent <fact1>74 cents</fact1> in total, the amount he spent on the pencils is <fact1>74</fact1> - <fact7>54</fact7> = <fact8>20 cents</fact8>. He bought <fact6>2 pencils</fact6>, so the cost of one pencil is <fact8>20</fact8> / <fact6>2</fact6> = <fact9>10 cents</fact9>. The answer is {10}."
901,Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?,"Reformatted Question: Mark had <fact1>24 marbles</fact1> and Evan had <fact2>3 marbles</fact2>. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?
Answer: Let's denote the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan as <fact3>x</fact3>. Initially, Mark had <fact1>24 marbles</fact1> and Evan had <fact2>3 marbles</fact2>. After Mark gave <fact3>x</fact3> marbles to Evan, Mark has <fact1>24 - x</fact1> marbles and Evan has <fact2>3 + x</fact2> marbles. According to the problem, Mark now has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. This can be expressed as the equation: <fact1>24 - x</fact1> = 2 * (<fact2>3 + x</fact2>). We can simplify this equation to solve for <fact3>x</fact3>. First, we distribute the 2 on the right-hand side of the equation: <fact1>24 - x</fact1> = 6 + 2x. Next, we can add x to both sides of the equation to get all the x terms on one side: <fact1>24</fact1> = 6 + 3x. Then, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x: <fact1>18</fact1> = 3x. Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x: <fact3>x</fact3> = 6. The answer is {6}."
902,Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,"Reformatted Question: Annette and Caitlin weigh <fact1>95 pounds</fact1> together. Caitlin and Sara weigh <fact2>87 pounds</fact2> together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?
Answer: We know that Annette and Caitlin weigh <fact1>95 pounds</fact1> together. If we subtract Caitlin's weight from this total, we can find Annette's weight. However, we don't know Caitlin's weight directly. We do know that Caitlin and Sara weigh <fact2>87 pounds</fact2> together. This means that Caitlin's weight is the difference between <fact1>95 pounds</fact1> and <fact2>87 pounds</fact2>, which is <fact1>95</fact1> - <fact2>87</fact2> = 8 pounds. Now we can find Annette's weight by subtracting Caitlin's weight from the total weight of Annette and Caitlin, which is <fact1>95</fact1> - <fact3>8</fact3> = 87 pounds. Similarly, we can find Sara's weight by subtracting Caitlin's weight from the total weight of Caitlin and Sara, which is <fact2>87</fact2> - <fact3>8</fact3> = 79 pounds. To find the difference in weight between Annette and Sara, we can subtract Sara's weight from Annette's weight, which is <fact4>87</fact4> - <fact5>79</fact5> = 8 pounds. The answer is {8}."
903,Kyle bought 3 presents. The first present cost $18. The second present cost $7 more than the first. The third present cost $11 less than the first. How much did Kyle pay for all 3 presents?,"Reformatted Question: Kyle bought <fact1>3 presents</fact1>. The first present cost <fact2>$18</fact2>. The second present cost <fact3>$7 more than the first</fact3>. The third present cost <fact4>$11 less than the first</fact4>. How much did Kyle pay for all <fact1>3 presents</fact1>?
Answer: The first present cost <fact2>$18</fact2>. The second present cost <fact3>$7 more than the first</fact3>, so it cost <fact2>$18</fact2> + <fact3>$7</fact3> = $25. The third present cost <fact4>$11 less than the first</fact4>, so it cost <fact2>$18</fact2> - <fact4>$11</fact4> = $7. Kyle bought <fact1>3 presents</fact1>, so he paid for <fact2>$18</fact2> + <fact3>$25</fact3> + <fact4>$7</fact4> = $50. The answer is {50}."
904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>24 apples</fact1> in total in three paper bags. The <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> contain a total of <fact3>11 apples</fact3>. The <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> contain a total of <fact5>18 apples</fact5>. How many apples are in the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6> together?
Answer: We know that there are <fact1>24 apples</fact1> in total. The <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> have <fact3>11 apples</fact3>, and the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> have <fact5>18 apples</fact5>. If we add the apples in the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> and the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> together, we get <fact3>11</fact3> + <fact5>18</fact5> = 29 apples. However, this is not the total number of apples in all three bags, which is <fact1>24</fact1>. So, the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> and the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> together have a total of 29 apples. Since the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> have <fact5>18 apples</fact5>, the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> must have 29 - <fact5>18</fact5> = 11 apples. But we know that the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> have <fact3>11 apples</fact3>, so the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6> must have <fact1>24</fact1> - <fact3>11</fact3> = 13 apples."
905,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,"Reformatted Question: A worm has fallen into a hole that is <fact1>26 inches deep</fact1>. It climbs up <fact2>8 inches</fact2> and slides back <fact3>3 inches</fact3> every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?

Answer: The worm needs to climb up the entire depth of the hole, which is <fact1>26 inches deep</fact1>. However, it only climbs up <fact2>8 inches</fact2> each day and slides back <fact3>3 inches</fact3> every day. This means that the worm effectively moves up <fact2>8 - 3 = 5 inches</fact2> each day. To find out how many days it will take the worm to reach the top, we can divide the total depth of the hole by the distance the worm moves up each day: <fact1>26 inches</fact1> / <fact2>5 inches/day</fact2> = 5.2 days. Since the worm cannot climb a fraction of a day, it will take the worm <fact3>6 days</fact3> to reach the top."
906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","Reformatted Question: Rita, <fact1>Peter</fact1>, and <fact2>Skeeter</fact2> are penguins. They weigh <fact3>90 pounds</fact3> altogether. <fact4>Rita and Peter</fact4> know they weigh the same amount. <fact5>Peter and Skeeter</fact5> know they weigh <fact6>68 pounds</fact6> together. How much does <fact2>Skeeter</fact2> weigh?

Answer: Since <fact4>Rita and Peter</fact4> know they weigh the same amount, we can let their weights be x. Then the total weight of the three penguins is x + x + <fact2>Skeeter's weight</fact2> = <fact3>90 pounds</fact3>. We also know that <fact5>Peter and Skeeter</fact5> weigh <fact6>68 pounds</fact6> together. This means that x + <fact2>Skeeter's weight</fact2> = <fact6>68 pounds</fact6>. Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for x and <fact2>Skeeter's weight</fact2>."
907,"A new store opened up at the mall. During the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left. During the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left. How many people were still in the store after 2 hours?","Reformatted Question: A new store opened up at the mall. During the first hour, <fact1>94 people came in</fact1> and <fact2>27 people left</fact2>. During the second hour, <fact3>18 people came in</fact3> and <fact4>9 people left</fact4>. How many people were still in the store after 2 hours?

Answer: We need to find out how many people were in the store after the first hour. In the first hour, <fact1>94 people came in</fact1> and <fact2>27 people left</fact2>. This means that the net number of people who came into the store in the first hour is <fact1>94</fact1> - <fact2>27</fact2> = 67 people. So, after the first hour, there were <fact1>67</fact1> people in the store. 

Now, we need to find out how many people were in the store after the second hour. In the second hour, <fact3>18 people came in</fact3> and <fact4>9 people left</fact4>. This means that the net number of people who came into the store in the second hour is <fact3>18</fact3> - <fact4>9</fact4> = 9 people. So, after the second hour, there were <fact1>67</fact1> + <fact3>9</fact3> = 76 people in the store. The answer is {76}."

After <fact3>Ben bought 3 more cards</fact3>, he had <fact4>twice as many cards as Tim</fact4>. How many cards did <fact5>Ben</fact5> have at first?
Answer: Since <fact5>Ben</fact5> had <fact4>twice as many cards as Tim</fact4> after buying <fact3>3 more cards</fact3>, we can express this as <fact5>Ben</fact5>'s cards = 2 * <fact2>20 cards</fact2> = 40 cards. Before buying <fact3>3 more cards</fact3>, <fact5>Ben</fact5> had <fact6>40 cards</fact6> - <fact3>3 cards</fact3> = 37 cards. The answer is {37}."

Each of the <fact1>4 boys</fact1> played <fact2>2 games</fact2> with every other player. How many games of checkers were played altogether?

Answer: There are <fact1>4 boys</fact1> in total. Each of them played <fact2>2 games</fact2> with every other player. To find out how many other players each boy played with, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of boys. That is <fact1>4</fact1> - <fact3>1</fact3> = 3 other players. So each boy played <fact2>2 games</fact2> with <fact3>3 other players</fact3>. That means each boy played <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>3</fact3> = 6 games. Since there are <fact1>4 boys</fact1>, the total number of games played is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 24 games."
910,A box of apples was delivered to Paul's Pies and Cakes. He put half of the apples aside for a pie he would make later. He put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator.

He put <fact1>half of the apples</fact1> aside for a pie he would make later. He put <fact2>25 of the remaining apples</fact2> in the refrigerator. That left <fact3>6 apples</fact3> to use in his muffins. How many apples were in the box at first?

Answer: He put <fact1>half of the apples</fact1> aside for a pie. This means that the other half of the apples is <fact1>half</fact1> + <fact2>half</fact2> = 1 whole. He put <fact2>25 of the remaining apples</fact2> in the refrigerator, so the number of apples left after putting 25 in the refrigerator is <fact2>25</fact2> + <fact3>6</fact3> = 31. This means that the total number of apples is <fact2>31</fact2> + <fact2>25</fact2> = 56. Since <fact1>half of the apples</fact1> were put aside, the total number of apples is 56 * 2 = 56."

Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did <fact1>Tara</fact1> have?
Answer: Since <fact3>Tara had $4 more than Megan</fact3>, let's denote the amount of money Megan had as <fact4>x</fact4>. This means Tara had <fact4>x + $4</fact4>. Together they had enough money to buy the scooter, which cost <fact2>$26</fact2>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: <fact4>x + (x + $4) = $26</fact4>. Combining like terms, we get <fact4>2x + $4 = $26</fact4>. Subtracting $4 from both sides, we get <fact4>2x = $22</fact4>. Dividing both sides by 2, we get <fact4>x = $11</fact4>. This means Megan had $11, and since <fact3>Tara had $4 more than Megan</fact3>, Tara had $11 + $4 = $15. The answer is {15}."

Answer: The zookeeper has <fact1>68 fish</fact1> in total. <fact2>19 penguins</fact2> have already gotten a fish, which means they have eaten <fact2>19</fact2> fish. To find out how many fish are left, we need to subtract the number of fish eaten from the total number of fish. This gives us <fact1>68</fact1> - <fact2>19</fact2> = 49 fish left. Since there are <fact3>36 penguins</fact3> in total, and <fact2>19 penguins</fact2> have already gotten a fish, the number of penguins that still need to get a fish is <fact3>36</fact3> - <fact2>19</fact2> = 17 penguins.

How many students will be there?

Answer: There are <fact1>48 students</fact1> altogether. <fact2>23 of the students</fact2> are boys and <fact3>25 are girls</fact3>. This means the total number of boys and girls is <fact2>23</fact2> + <fact3>25</fact3> = 48. However, this is the same as the total number of students altogether. Since <fact4>9 students will not be able to go to the party</fact4>, we need to subtract 9 from the total number of students.

If tulip bulbs come in packs of 15 and daffodil bulbs come in packs of 16, what is the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy?","Reformatted Question: Rita is buying flower bulbs for her garden. She wants to buy the same number of <fact1>tulips</fact1> and <fact2>daffodils</fact2>. If <fact3>tulip bulbs come in packs of 15</fact3> and <fact4>daffodil bulbs come in packs of 16</fact4>, what is the <fact5>least number</fact5> of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy?

Answer: Since Rita wants to buy the same number of <fact1>tulips</fact1> and <fact2>daffodils</fact2>, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 16. To do this, we can list the multiples of each number: 
Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270, 285, 300, 315, 330, 345, 360, 375, 390, 405, 420, 435, 450, 465, 480, 495, 510, 525, 540, 555, 570, 585, 600, ...

She wants to deliver the same combination of <fact1>brochures</fact1> and <fact2>pamphlets</fact2> to each office, without having any materials left over. What is the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to?

Answer: To find the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>12</fact2>. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. 

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>12</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>18</fact1> are <fact3>1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18</fact3> and the factors of <fact2>12</fact2> are <fact4>1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12</fact4>. 

The greatest common factor of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>12</fact2> is <fact5>6</fact5>. This means that Kathleen can distribute <fact1>6 brochures</fact1> and <fact2>6 pamphlets</fact2> to each office. 

To find the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to, we can divide the total number of brochures and pamphlets by the number of brochures and pamphlets each office will receive.

He wants to cut them up to produce many pieces of cord that are all of the same length, with no cord left over. What is the greatest length, in feet, that he can make them?

Answer: To find the greatest length of the cord, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two cord lengths, <fact2>15 feet</fact2> and <fact3>12 feet</fact3>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. 

First, we divide the larger number, <fact2>15</fact2>, by the smaller number, <fact3>12</fact3>, and find the remainder. The remainder is <fact4>3</fact4>. 

Next, we divide the smaller number, <fact3>12</fact3>, by the remainder, <fact4>3</fact4>, and find the remainder. The remainder is <fact5>0</fact5>. 

Since the remainder is <fact5>0</fact5>, the divisor, <fact4>3</fact4>, is the GCD of the two cord lengths. Therefore, the greatest length that Matt can make the cord is <fact4>3 feet</fact4>."

974,"A family is preparing backpacks filled with school supplies to donate to children in need. They have 9 pencils and 15 notebooks. If they want to make all the backpacks the same, with no school supplies left over, what is the greatest number of backpacks they can fill?","Reformatted Question: A family is preparing <fact1>backpacks</fact1> filled with <fact2>school supplies</fact2> to donate to <fact3>children in need</fact3>. They have <fact4>9 pencils</fact4> and <fact5>15 notebooks</fact5>. If they want to make all the <fact1>backpacks</fact1> the same, with no <fact2>school supplies</fact2> left over, what is the <fact6>greatest number of backpacks</fact6> they can fill?

Answer: To find the greatest number of backpacks they can fill, we need to consider the limiting factor, which is the item that will run out first. In this case, the family has <fact4>9 pencils</fact4> and <fact5>15 notebooks</fact5>. Since they want to make all the backpacks the same, with no school supplies left over, they will need to use the same number of pencils and notebooks in each backpack.

Let's consider the number of notebooks. They have <fact5>15 notebooks</fact5> and want to make the same number of backpacks. The greatest number of backpacks they can fill will be determined by the number of notebooks, which is 15. However, they also need to consider the number of pencils, which is <fact4>9</fact4>. Since they want to make all the backpacks the same, they will need to use 9 pencils in each backpack.

Now, let's divide the total number of notebooks by the number of pencils: 15 ÷ 9 = 1.67. However, they can't fill a fraction of a backpack, so they will need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means they can fill 1 backpack with 9 pencils and 9 notebooks, but they will have 6 notebooks left over.

To find the greatest number of backpacks they can fill, we need to consider the number of backpacks they can fill with the remaining notebooks. They have 6 notebooks left over, and they want to make the same number of backpacks. The greatest number of backpacks they can fill with the remaining notebooks is 6 ÷ 9 = 0.67. Again, they can't fill a fraction of a backpack, so they will need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means they can fill 0 backpacks with the remaining notebooks.

However, they can use the remaining 6 notebooks to fill 6 backpacks, but they will need to find 6 more pencils for each backpack. Since they only have 3 pencils left, they won't be able to fill any more backpacks with the remaining 6 notebooks.

In conclusion, they can fill 1 backpack with 9 pencils and 9 notebooks, but they will have 6 notebooks left over. They can use the remaining 6 notebooks to fill 6 backpacks, but they will need to find 6 more pencils for each backpack. Since they only have 3 pencils left, they won't be able to fill any more backpacks with the remaining 6 notebooks.

The answer is {1}."

Answer: To find the greatest number of sets, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>9</fact2>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>9</fact2> without leaving a remainder. 

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>9</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>18</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The factors of <fact2>9</fact2> are 1, 3, and 9. 

The greatest number that appears in both lists is <fact3>9</fact3>. Therefore, the greatest number of sets Mrs. Wilson can create is <fact3>9</fact3>."
976,"Philip is buying pens and pencils from the store. Pens come in packages of 12, but pencils are sold in packages of 15. If Philip wishes to purchase the same number of pens as pencils, what is the smallest number of pens that he can buy?","Reformatted Question: Philip is buying <fact1> pens</fact1> and <fact2>pencils</fact2> from the store. <fact3>Pens come in packages of 12</fact3>, but <fact4>pencils are sold in packages of 15</fact4>. If Philip wishes to purchase the same number of <fact1>pens</fact1> as <fact2>pencils</fact2>, what is the <fact5>smallest number of pens</fact5> that he can buy?

Answer: We need to find the smallest number of pens that Philip can buy. To do that, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15. The LCM of 12 and 15 is 60. This means that Philip can buy 60 pens and 60 pencils. However, the question asks for the smallest number of pens that he can buy, not the smallest number of pens and pencils. Since 60 is the smallest number of pens that Philip can buy, the answer is 60."

What is the smallest possible number that Eddie could be thinking of?
Answer: To find the smallest possible number that Eddie could be thinking of, we need to find the smallest number that is divisible by both <fact1>8</fact1> and <fact2>5</fact2>. The smallest number that is divisible by both <fact1>8</fact1> and <fact2>5</fact2> is the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>8</fact1> and <fact2>5</fact2>. The LCM of <fact1>8</fact1> and <fact2>5</fact2> is <fact3>40</fact3>. Therefore, the smallest possible number that Eddie could be thinking of is <fact3>40</fact3>."
978,"Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?","Reformatted Question: Heather enjoys <fact1>bird-watching</fact1> and observed two types of birds traveling this season: <fact2>ducks</fact2> and <fact3>seagulls</fact3>. While the <fact4>ducks</fact4> traveled in <fact5>flocks of 18</fact5>, the <fact6>seagulls</fact6> traveled in <fact7>flocks of 10</fact7>. If Heather observed the same total number of <fact8>ducks</fact8> and <fact9>seagulls</fact9>, what is the smallest number of <fact10>ducks</fact10> that she could have observed?

Answer: We are looking for the smallest number of ducks that Heather could have observed. Since the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the number of ducks must be a multiple of 18. Let's denote the number of ducks as D. Since Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, the number of seagulls must also be a multiple of 18. The seagulls traveled in flocks of 10, so the number of seagulls must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the number of seagulls is also a multiple of 18. We can write an equation to represent this: D = 18x, where x is an integer. Since the number of seagulls is also a multiple of 18, we can write another equation: 18x = 10y, where y is an integer. To find the smallest value of D, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies both equations. We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2: 9x = 5y. Now, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies this equation. We can try different values of x and see which one works. Let's start with x = 5: 9(5) = 45, which is not a multiple of 5. Let's try x = 10: 9(10) = 90, which is a multiple of 5. Therefore, x = 10 is a solution to the equation. Now, we can find the smallest value of D: D = 18x = 18(10) = 180. Therefore, the smallest number of ducks that Heather could have observed is 180."
979,"An event has 12 adults and 20 children. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?","Reformatted Question: An event has <fact1>12 adults</fact1> and <fact2>20 children</fact2>. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of <fact3>adults and children</fact3> and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?
Answer: To find the greatest number of tables, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>12</fact1> and <fact2>20</fact2>, which are the number of adults and children, respectively. The GCD will give us the maximum number of people that can be placed on each table. 

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 12 and 20. 

First, we divide 20 by 12, which gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 8. 

Then, we divide 12 by 8, which gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 4. 

Next, we divide 8 by 4, which gives us a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. 

Since the remainder is 0, the divisor (4) is the GCD of 12 and 20. 

Therefore, the greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 4."
980,Joe's Bath Shop sells bars of soap in boxes of 5 bars and bottles of soap in boxes of 19 bottles.

What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?,"Reformatted Question: Joe's Bath Shop sells bars of soap in boxes of <fact1>5 bars</fact1> and bottles of soap in boxes of <fact2>19 bottles</fact2>. An employee is surprised to discover that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles last week. What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?

Answer: Since the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles last week, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>19</fact2>. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>19</fact2>. 

The LCM of <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>19</fact2> is <fact3>95</fact3>. This is because <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>19</fact2> are both prime numbers, so their LCM is simply their product, <fact3>95</fact3>. 

Therefore, the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold is <fact3>95</fact3> bars and <fact3>95</fact3> bottles."
981,Trevor counted 77 coins in his bank. He counted 29 quarters. The rest are dimes.

Answer: There are <fact1>77 coins</fact1> in total. <fact2>29 are quarters</fact2>. To find the number of dimes, we need to subtract the number of quarters from the total number of coins. So, the number of dimes is <fact1>77</fact1> - <fact2>29</fact2> = 48. We are asked to find the difference between the total number of coins and the number of quarters. This means we need to subtract the number of quarters from the total number of coins. Therefore, the difference is <fact1>77</fact1> - <fact2>29</fact2> = 48. The answer is {48}."

1086,"Willy has 5,092 crayons. Lucy has 3,971 crayons. How many more crayons does Willy have than Lucy?","Reformatted Question: Willy has <fact1>5,092 crayons</fact1>. Lucy has <fact2>3,971 crayons</fact2>. How many more crayons does Willy have than Lucy?
Answer: To find the difference between the number of crayons Willy and Lucy have, we need to subtract the number of crayons Lucy has from the number of crayons Willy has. This is because the question asks for the difference, which can be calculated by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. Therefore, we need to calculate <fact1>5,092</fact1> - <fact2>3,971</fact2>. This will give us the number of crayons Willy has more than Lucy. The result of this calculation is <fact1>5,092</fact1> - <fact2>3,971</fact2> = 1,121. The answer is {1,121}."
1087,"You have $12 in nickels and quarters. If you have the same number of each kind of coin, how many nickels do you have?","Reformatted Question: You have <fact1>$12 in nickels and quarters</fact1>. If you have the same number of each kind of coin, how many nickels do you have?
Answer: Since you have the same number of nickels and quarters, let's call the number of each type of coin <fact2>x</fact2>. The total value of the nickels is <fact1>$0.05 * x = $0.05x</fact1> and the total value of the quarters is <fact1>$0.25 * x = $0.25x</fact1>. The total value of all the coins is <fact1>$0.05x + $0.25x = $0.30x</fact1>. Since the total value is $12, we can set up the equation <fact1>$0.30x = $12</fact1>. To solve for <fact2>x</fact2>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30, which gives us <fact1>x = $12 / $0.30 = 40</fact1>. Since <fact2>x</fact2> represents the number of nickels, the number of nickels you have is 40. The answer is {40}."

1093,Tony made 14 L of lemonade for a party. His guests drank 9500 mL of the lemonade. How many milliliters of lemonade did Tony have left over?,"Reformatted Question: Tony made <fact1>14 L of lemonade</fact1> for a party. His guests drank <fact2>9500 mL of the lemonade</fact2>. How many milliliters of lemonade did Tony have left over?
Answer: To find out how many milliliters of lemonade Tony had left over, we need to first convert the amount of lemonade he made from liters to milliliters. Since there are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, we can convert 14 L to milliliters by multiplying 14 by 1000. This gives us 14 * 1000 = 14000 mL. Now, we can subtract the amount of lemonade his guests drank from the total amount he made to find out how much he had left over.

Answer: Susan started her homework at <fact1>1:59 p.m.</fact1>. She finished her homework <fact2>96 minutes</fact2> later. To find the time she finished her homework, we need to add <fact2>96 minutes</fact2> to <fact1>1:59 p.m.</fact1>. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, <fact2>96 minutes</fact2> is equal to <fact2>1 hour and 36 minutes</fact2>. Therefore, Susan finished her homework at <fact1>1:59 p.m.</fact1> + <fact2>1 hour and 36 minutes</fact2> = <fact5>3:35 p.m.</fact5>. Susan had <fact3>volleyball practice</fact3> at <fact4>4:00 p.m.</fact4>.

1095,Thomas made 8700 mL of tomato soup. He packed 1.6 L of the soup in his kids' lunches. He then froze half of the remaining soup. How many milliliters of soup did Thomas freeze?,"Reformatted Question: Thomas made <fact1>8700 mL</fact1> of tomato soup. He packed <fact2>1.6 L</fact2> of the soup in his kids' lunches. He then froze <fact3>half</fact3> of the remaining soup. How many milliliters of soup did Thomas freeze?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much soup was left after Thomas packed <fact2>1.6 L</fact2> in his kids' lunches. Since <fact1>8700 mL</fact1> is the total amount of soup, we need to convert <fact2>1.6 L</fact2> to milliliters. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, so <fact2>1.6 L</fact2> is equal to 1.6 * 1000 = 1600 milliliters. Now, we can subtract 1600 milliliters from the total amount of soup: <fact1>8700 mL</fact1> - 1600 milliliters = 7100 milliliters. This is the amount of soup left after Thomas packed the soup in his kids' lunches. Since he then froze <fact3>half</fact3> of the remaining soup, we need to divide 7100 milliliters by 2: 7100 / 2 = 3550 milliliters. Therefore, Thomas froze 3550 milliliters of soup."

Therefore, Payton will have <fact3>5:45 p.m.</fact3> - <fact6>4:52 p.m.</fact6> = <fact7>53 minutes</fact7> between finishing her bike ride and eating dinner. The answer is {53}."
1102,"It is 4:12 p.m. Emma's mom will be home from work in 70 minutes, and Emma has gymnastics lessons at 6:00 p.m. How much time will Emma have between the time that her mom gets home from work and the beginning of gymnastics lessons?","Reformatted Question: It is <fact1>4:12 p.m.</fact1>. Emma's mom will be home from work in <fact2>70 minutes</fact2>, and Emma has gymnastics lessons at <fact3>6:00 p.m.</fact3>. How much time will Emma have between the time that her mom gets home from work and the beginning of gymnastics lessons?

Answer: First, let's find out when Emma's mom will be home from work. We know that it is currently <fact1>4:12 p.m.</fact1> and her mom will be home from work in <fact2>70 minutes</fact2>. To find the time when her mom will be home, we need to add <fact2>70 minutes</fact2> to the current time. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert <fact2>70 minutes</fact2> to hours and minutes by dividing 70 by 60. This gives us 1 hour and 10 minutes. So, we add 1 hour and 10 minutes to the current time of <fact1>4:12 p.m.</fact1>. This gives us 5:22 p.m. as the time when Emma's mom will be home from work.

Now, we need to find the time difference between 5:22 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. We can do this by subtracting 5:22 p.m. from 6:00 p.m. This gives us a time difference of 38 minutes.

Therefore, Emma will have 38 minutes between the time that her mom gets home from work and the beginning of gymnastics lessons."

She divided the apple slices equally between <fact2>5 large bowls</fact2>. How many grams of apple slices did Cora put in each bowl?

Answer: First, we need to convert <fact1>18 kg</fact1> to grams. Since 1 kg = 1000 grams, <fact1>18 kg</fact1> is equal to 18 * 1000 = 18000 grams. Now, we need to divide the total number of grams by the number of bowls, which is <fact2>5</fact2>. So, Cora put 18000 / <fact2>5</fact2> = 3600 grams of apple slices in each bowl. The answer is {3600}."
1105,Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up one third of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?,"Reformatted Question: Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up <fact1>one third</fact1> of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with <fact2>4 L</fact2> of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?

Answer: To find out the total amount of paint Gina mixed, we need to find out the total capacity of the container and then add the amount of red paint and blue paint. 

Since Gina filled up <fact1>one third</fact1> of the container with red paint, this means the remaining space is <fact3>two thirds</fact3> of the container. She filled the remaining space with <fact2>4 L</fact2> of blue paint. This means the total capacity of the container is <fact2>4 L</fact2> / <fact3>two thirds</fact3> = <fact2>4 L</fact2> * <fact4>three halves</fact4> = <fact5>6 L</fact5>. 

Since 1 L = 1000 mL, the total capacity of the container in milliliters is <fact5>6 L</fact5> * 1000 mL/L = 6000 mL.

In addition to the blue paint, Gina also filled up <fact1>one third</fact1> of the container with red paint. The amount of red paint is <fact1>one third</fact1> * <fact5>6 L</fact5> = <fact6>2 L</fact6> = 2000 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of paint Gina mixed is the sum of the amount of red paint and blue paint, which is 2000 mL + 4000 mL = 6000 mL."

Answer: The service charge is <fact1>4%</fact1> of the total order. This means that the service charge is <fact1>4%</fact1> * <fact2>450</fact2>. To find the service charge, we need to convert <fact1>4%</fact1> to a decimal by dividing by 100: <fact1>4%</fact1> / 100 = 0.04. Now we can multiply 0.04 by <fact2>450</fact2> to find the service charge: 0.04 * <fact2>450</fact2> = 18. The total amount you paid is the original order plus the service charge: <fact2>450</fact2> + 18 = 468. The answer is {468}."

Answer: To find the marked price, we need to consider the discount and the final price. The discount is <fact2>18%</fact2>, which means the customer paid <fact2>82%</fact2> of the marked price. We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 
0.82 * marked price = $147.60. 
To find the marked price, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.82. 
marked price = $147.60 / 0.82 
marked price = $180"

How much does he get from the <fact3>1st job</fact3> if he gets per week a total of <fact4>$3,875</fact4>?

Answer: We know that Mila's father has <fact1>2 jobs</fact1>. Let's call the amount he gets from the 2nd job <fact5>x</fact5>. Since <fact2>1st job pays $375 more than the 2nd job</fact2>, the amount he gets from the 1st job is <fact5>x + $375</fact5>. We also know that he gets per week a total of <fact4>$3,875</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: <fact5>x + (x + $375) = $3,875</fact5>. Combining like terms, we get: <fact5>2x + $375 = $3,875</fact5>. Subtracting $375 from both sides, we get: <fact5>2x = $3,500</fact5>. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: <fact5>x = $1,750</fact5>. Now that we know the amount he gets from the 2nd job, we can find the amount he gets from the 1st job by adding $375: <fact5>x + $375 = $1,750 + $375 = $2,125</fact5>. Therefore, he gets $2,125 from the 1st job. The answer is {2125}."

How much more does <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weigh?
Answer: The ratio of the weight of <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> to the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> is <fact3>5:7</fact3>. This means that for every 5 kg of weight of <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1>, <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weighs 7 kg. Since <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> weighs <fact4>20 kg</fact4>, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2>. Let x be the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2>. Then, 5/7 = 20/x. Cross-multiplying, we get 5x = 140. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 28. So, <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weighs 28 kg. To find how much more <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weighs than <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1>, we subtract the weight of <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> from the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2>. 28 - 20 = 8.

1115,A recipe for fruit punch says to use 8 ounces of orange juice for every 3 ounces of grape juice. Nicky used 72 ounces of orange juice. How many fewer ounces of grape juice were used?,"Reformatted Question: A recipe for <fact1>fruit punch</fact1> says to use <fact2>8 ounces of orange juice</fact2> for every <fact3>3 ounces of grape juice</fact3>. <fact4>Nicky used 72 ounces of orange juice</fact4>. How many fewer ounces of <fact5>grape juice</fact5> were used?

Answer: The recipe says to use <fact2>8 ounces of orange juice</fact2> for every <fact3>3 ounces of grape juice</fact3>. This means that for every 8 ounces of orange juice, <fact3>3 ounces of grape juice</fact3> are used. Since <fact4>Nicky used 72 ounces of orange juice</fact4>, we can find out how many ounces of grape juice were used by dividing 72 by 8 and then multiplying the result by 3. 72 / 8 = 9, and 9 * 3 = 27. This means that 27 ounces of grape juice were used. Since the question asks how many fewer ounces of grape juice were used, we need to find the difference between the total amount of grape juice used and the amount that would have been used if the recipe was followed. However, the question does not provide the total amount of grape juice used, it only asks how many fewer ounces of grape juice were used. The question does not provide enough information to determine the total amount of grape juice used. However, we can determine the ratio of grape juice to orange juice used. The ratio is 3:8. If 72 ounces of orange juice were used, then the ratio of grape juice to orange juice used is 3:8. The ratio of grape juice to orange juice used is 3:8, and the amount of orange juice used is 72 ounces. We can find the amount of grape juice used by multiplying 72 by 3/8. The amount of grape juice used is 72 * 3/8 = 27 ounces. Since the question asks how many fewer ounces of grape juice were used, we need to find the difference between the amount of grape juice used and the amount that would have been used if the recipe was followed. The amount that would have been used if the recipe was followed is 72 * 3/8 = 27 ounces. The amount of grape juice used is 27 ounces. The amount that would have been used if the recipe was followed is 27 ounces. The difference is 0. The answer is {0}."

1119,"A fence post in Tina's garden is 4 feet tall. When she measured the fence post's shadow, she found that it was 12 feet long. A tree in Tina's yard had a shadow of 72 feet. How tall is the tree?","Reformatted Question: A fence post in Tina's garden is <fact1>4 feet tall</fact1>. When she measured the fence post's shadow, she found that it was <fact2>12 feet long</fact2>. A tree in Tina's yard had a shadow of <fact3>72 feet</fact3>. How tall is the tree?

Answer: We know that the ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is the same for all objects at a given time. This is because the angle of the sun is the same for all objects. We can use this information to find the height of the tree. 

Let's start by finding the ratio of the height of the fence post to the length of its shadow. This is <fact1>4 feet</fact1> / <fact2>12 feet</fact2> = 1/3. Since this ratio is the same for all objects at a given time, it must also be the same for the tree. We can use this ratio to find the height of the tree. 

We know that the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow is 1/3. We also know that the length of the tree's shadow is <fact3>72 feet</fact3>. We can use this information to find the height of the tree. 

Let's set up a proportion to represent this situation: (height of the tree) / <fact3>72 feet</fact3> = 1/3. We can solve this proportion to find the height of the tree. 

To solve the proportion, we can cross-multiply: (height of the tree) * 3 = <fact3>72 feet</fact3>. Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the height of the tree: (height of the tree) = <fact3>72 feet</fact3> / 3 = 24 feet. 

Therefore, the height of the tree is 24 feet."

How many meters does Daniel have to walk?,"Reformatted Question: The library is <fact1>14.2 km</fact1> away from Daniel's apartment. The bus takes Daniel <fact2>11.15 km</fact2> of the way to the library. He has to walk the remaining distance. How many meters does Daniel have to walk?
Answer: The library is <fact1>14.2 km</fact1> away from Daniel's apartment. The bus takes Daniel <fact2>11.15 km</fact2> of the way to the library. To find the remaining distance that Daniel has to walk, we need to subtract the distance the bus took from the total distance to the library. This is <fact1>14.2 km</fact1> - <fact2>11.15 km</fact2> = 3.05 km. Since we are asked to find the distance in meters, we need to convert the remaining distance from kilometers to meters. 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. Therefore, 3.05 km is equal to 3.05 * 1000 = 3050 meters. The answer is {3050}."
1155,Lisa went on a 52 km. She divided the distance traveled evenly over 4 days. How many meters did Lisa walk each day?,"Reformatted Question: Lisa went on a <fact1>52 km</fact1> trip. She divided the distance traveled <fact2>evenly</fact2> over <fact3>4 days</fact3>. How many meters did Lisa walk each day?
Answer: The distance traveled was <fact1>52 km</fact1>. Since <fact2>km</fact2> is a unit of length, to convert it to meters, we multiply it by 1000. This is because there are 1000 meters in a kilometer. So, <fact1>52 km</fact1> is equal to 52 * 1000 = 52000 meters. The distance was divided <fact3>evenly</fact3> over <fact3>4 days</fact3>, so to find the distance walked each day, we divide the total distance by the number of days. Therefore, Lisa walked 52000 / <fact3>4</fact3> = 13000 meters each day. The answer is {13000}."

If this pattern continues, how many empty cans will Andrew put in the sixth bin?
Answer: To find the pattern, we need to look at the differences between the consecutive numbers of cans. The difference between <fact2>4</fact2> and <fact1>2</fact1> is <fact2>4</fact2> - <fact1>2</fact1> = 2. The difference between <fact3>7</fact3> and <fact2>4</fact2> is <fact3>7</fact3> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 3. The difference between <fact4>11</fact4> and <fact3>7</fact3> is <fact4>11</fact4> - <fact3>7</fact3> = 4. The difference between <fact5>16</fact5> and <fact4>11</fact4> is <fact5>16</fact5> - <fact4>11</fact4> = 5. We can see that the difference is increasing by 1 each time.

If this pattern continues, how many plastic bottles will Ava put in the <fact5>fifth</fact5> bag?

Answer: We can observe that the number of bottles in each bag is increasing by a certain pattern. To find out how many bottles will be in the fifth bag, we need to find the pattern and apply it to the fifth bag. Let's examine the numbers: <fact1>45</fact1>, <fact2>53</fact2>, <fact3>61</fact3>, and <fact4>69</fact4>. We can see that each number is increasing by a certain amount: <fact2>53</fact2> - <fact1>45</fact1> = 8, <fact3>61</fact3> - <fact2>53</fact2> = 8, and <fact4>69</fact4> - <fact3>61</fact3> = 8. This means that the pattern is adding 8 bottles to each bag. To find out how many bottles will be in the fifth bag, we need to add 8 bottles to the fourth bag: <fact4>69</fact4> + 8 = 77. Therefore, Ava will put <fact6>77</fact6> plastic bottles in the fifth bag."

If this pattern continues, how many cherries will Christine put in the sixth bowl?

Answer: There is a pattern in the number of cherries in each bowl. To find the pattern, we need to look at the differences between the numbers of cherries in consecutive bowls. The difference between the first and second bowl is <fact2>40</fact2> - <fact1>35</fact1> = 5 cherries. The difference between the second and third bowl is <fact3>45</fact3> - <fact2>40</fact2> = 5 cherries. The difference between the third and fourth bowl is <fact4>50</fact4> - <fact3>45</fact3> = 5 cherries. The difference between the fourth and fifth bowl is <fact5>55</fact5> - <fact4>50</fact4> = 5 cherries. This pattern of 5 cherries more in each bowl continues. Therefore, to find the number of cherries in the sixth bowl, we add 5 to the number of cherries in the fifth bowl. So, the number of cherries in the sixth bowl is <fact5>55</fact5> + 5 = 60 cherries. The answer is {60}."

Answer: To find the number of beads Jenna will put in the fifth jar, we need to identify the pattern of the number of beads in each jar. The number of beads in each jar is increasing by 9, 9, and 9 beads, respectively. Since this pattern continues, we can add 9 to the number of beads in the fourth jar to find the number of beads in the fifth jar. Therefore, the number of beads in the fifth jar will be <fact4>101</fact4> + 9 = 110 beads. The answer is {110}."

Answer: To determine the greatest number of platters, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chicken legs, thighs, and wings. The GCD of <fact2>96</fact2>, <fact3>144</fact3>, and <fact4>224</fact4> is the largest number that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder. 

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization. In this case, we can use prime factorization. The prime factorization of <fact2>96</fact2> is 2^5 * 3, <fact3>144</fact3> is 2^4 * 3^2, and <fact4>224</fact4> is 2^5 * 7. 

The common factors among the three numbers are 2^4 and 3. Therefore, the GCD of <fact2>96</fact2>, <fact3>144</fact3>, and <fact4>224</fact4> is 2^4 * 3 = 48. 

Now that we have the GCD, we can determine the number of platters that can be made. The number of platters is equal to the total number of chicken pieces divided by the GCD. 

The total number of chicken pieces is <fact2>96</fact2> + <fact3>144</fact3> + <fact4>224</fact4> = 464. 

Therefore, the number of platters that can be made is 464 / 48 = 9.67. Since we cannot make a fraction of a platter, we round down to 9 platters. 

However, we need to check if 9 platters can be made with the same number of chicken pieces on each platter. If 9 platters are made, each platter will have 96 / 9 = 10.67 legs, 144 / 9 = 16 legs, and 224 / 9 = 24.89 wings. Since we cannot have a fraction of a chicken piece, we cannot make 9 platters with the same number of chicken pieces on each platter.

Therefore, we need to check the next lower number of platters, which is 8. If 8 platters are made, each platter will have 96 / 8 = 12 legs, 144 / 8 = 18 thighs, and 224 / 8 = 28 wings. 

Since each platter can have the same number of chicken pieces, the staff can make 8 platters with the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter."

He has <fact1>9 carrot sticks</fact1> and <fact2>18 celery sticks</fact2>. If he wants each serving to be <fact3>identical</fact3>, with no food left over, what is the greatest number of servings Abraham can create?
Answer: Abraham has <fact1>9 carrot sticks</fact1> and <fact2>18 celery sticks</fact2>. To create identical servings with no food left over, the number of carrot sticks and celery sticks must be the same in each serving. Since he has more celery sticks, the number of servings will be determined by the number of celery sticks. To find the greatest number of servings, we need to divide the total number of celery sticks by the number of celery sticks per serving. However, we don't know the number of celery sticks per serving yet. To find the greatest number of servings, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of carrot sticks and celery sticks. The GCD of 9 and 18 is 9. Therefore, the greatest number of servings Abraham can create is 9."

If he has 18 bus tickets and 12 subway tickets to split equally among the envelopes, and wants no tickets left over, what is the greatest number of envelopes Russom can make?","Reformatted Question: If he has <fact1>18 bus tickets</fact1> and <fact2>12 subway tickets</fact2> to split equally among the envelopes, and wants no tickets left over, what is the greatest number of envelopes Russom can make?
Answer: To find the greatest number of envelopes, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>12</fact2>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>12</fact2> without leaving a remainder. 

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. We start by dividing the larger number (<fact1>18</fact1>) by the smaller number (<fact2>12</fact2>).

18 = 1 * 12 + 6

Next, we divide the smaller number (<fact2>12</fact2>) by the remainder (<fact3>6</fact3>).

12 = 2 * 6 + 0

Since the remainder is 0, the divisor (<fact3>6</fact3>) is the GCD of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>12</fact2>. Therefore, the greatest number of envelopes Russom can make is <fact3>6</fact3>."

She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?","Reformatted Question: Kiara baked <fact1>30 oatmeal cookies</fact1> and <fact2>48 chocolate chip cookies</fact2> to package in plastic containers for her teacher friends at school. She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?
Answer: To find the greatest number of cookies possible per container, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip cookies. The GCD of <fact1>30</fact1> and <fact2>48</fact2> is 6. This means that each container can have 6 oatmeal cookies and 8 chocolate chip cookies. To find the total number of containers needed, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per container. The total number of cookies is <fact1>30</fact1> + <fact2>48</fact2> = 78. The number of cookies per container is 6 + 8 = 14. However, this is not the correct number of cookies per container, as we are trying to maximize the number of cookies per container. The correct number of cookies per container is 6 and 8, which is 14, but we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per container. The correct number of cookies per container is 6 and 8, but we need to divide the total number of cookies by 6 and 8. The total number of containers needed is 78 / (6 + 8) = 78 / 14 = 5.714285714. However, we can't have a fraction of a container, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Kiara needs 6 plastic containers."

What is the <fact3>smallest possible page number</fact3> that could have been assigned?
Answer: To find the smallest possible page number that could have been assigned, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 13. This is because the page number must be divisible by both 4 and 13. 

First, let's consider the multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, ...

What is the smallest number of <fact2>butterflies</fact2> that she could have seen?

Answer: Since Kristen observes <fact2>butterflies</fact2> in groups of <fact4>44</fact4>, the number of <fact2>butterflies</fact2> must be a multiple of <fact4>44</fact4>. This means that the number of <fact2>butterflies</fact2> is of the form <fact6>44k</fact6>, where <fact7>k</fact7> is a positive integer. Since Kristen observes an <fact1>identical number</fact1> of <fact2>butterflies</fact2> and <fact3>fireflies</fact3>, the number of <fact3>fireflies</fact3> must also be a multiple of <fact4>44</fact4>. However, the number of <fact3>fireflies</fact3> is in groups of <fact5>17</fact5>, so the number of <fact3>fireflies</fact3> is of the form <fact8>17m</fact8>, where <fact9>m</fact9> is a positive integer. Since both <fact6>44k</fact6> and <fact8>17m</fact8> are multiples of <fact4>44</fact4>, we can write <fact8>17m</fact8> = <fact4>44n</fact4> for some positive integer <fact10>n</fact10>. Therefore, <fact8>17m</fact8> = <fact4>44n</fact4> = <fact4>4 * 11n</fact4> = <fact11>17 * 2n</fact11>. Since <fact8>17m</fact8> and <fact11>17 * 2n</fact11> are both multiples of <fact5>17</fact5>, we can conclude that <fact8>17m</fact8> = <fact11>17 * 2n</fact11>. This implies that <fact8>m</fact8> = <fact12>2n</fact12>, so <fact8>m</fact8> is an even integer. Since <fact8>m</fact8> is the number of <fact3>fireflies</fact3> in a group, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, <fact8>m</fact8> is a positive even integer. Since <fact8>m</fact8> is a multiple of <fact5>17</fact5>, we can write <fact8>m</fact8> = <fact5>17p</fact5> for some positive integer <fact13>p</fact13>. Therefore, <fact5>17p</fact5> = <fact12>2n</fact12>, so <fact5>17p</fact5> is an even integer. Since <fact5>17</fact5> is an odd integer, <fact13>p</fact13> must be an even integer. Therefore, <fact13>p</fact13> is a positive even integer. Since <fact13>p</fact13> is the number of <fact3>fireflies</fact3> in a group, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, <fact13>p</fact13> is a positive even integer. Since <fact13>p</fact13> is a multiple of <fact5>17</fact5>, we can write <fact13>p</fact13> = <fact5>17q</fact5> for some positive integer <fact14>q</fact14>. Therefore, <fact5>17q</fact5> = <fact12>2n</fact12>, so <fact5>17q</fact5> is an even integer. Since <fact5>17</fact5> is an odd integer, <fact14>q</fact14> must be an even integer. Therefore, <fact14>q</fact14> is a positive even integer. Since <fact14>q</fact14> is the number of <fact3>fireflies</fact3> in a group, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, <fact14>q</fact14> is a positive even integer. Since <fact14>"

What is the smallest total number of pets each could be walking?
Answer: Let's consider the fact that Gabe and Steven are walking the same total number of pets. This means that the total number of pets must be a multiple of both 2 and 10. The smallest number that is a multiple of both 2 and 10 is their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of 2 and 10 is 10. Since Gabe walks pets in groups of 2, the smallest total number of pets he could be walking is 10. Since Steven walks pets in groups of 10, the smallest total number of pets he could be walking is also 10. Therefore, the smallest total number of pets each could be walking is 10."

If Randy bought the same number of slices of each type of cheese, what is the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought?

Answer: To find the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 28. 

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors. 12 can be broken down into 2^2 * 3, and 28 can be broken down into 2^2 * 7. 

Now, we need to find the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. In this case, the highest power of 2 is 2^2, and the highest power of 3 is 3, and the highest power of 7 is 7. 

To find the LCM, we multiply these highest powers together: 2^2 * 3 * 7 = 4 * 3 * 7 = 84.

Therefore, the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought is 84."
1227,Karen is packing equal quantities of pretzels and crackers for snacks. Karen bags the pretzels in groups of 5 and the crackers in groups of 7. What is the smallest number of crackers that she can pack?,"Reformatted Question: Karen is packing <fact1>equal quantities</fact1> of <fact2>pretzels and crackers</fact2> for <fact3>snacks</fact3>. Karen bags the <fact4>pretzels in groups of 5</fact4> and the <fact5>crackers in groups of 7</fact5>. What is the <fact6>smallest number of crackers</fact6> that she can pack?

Answer: Since Karen is packing <fact1>equal quantities</fact1> of <fact2>pretzels and crackers</fact2>, the number of pretzels must be a multiple of 5. Let's consider the multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, etc. Now, we need to find the smallest number of crackers that is a multiple of 7 and can be paired with one of these multiples of 5. 

To find the smallest number of crackers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 7. The LCM of 5 and 7 is 35. Since 35 is a multiple of 5 and 7, it can be paired with both groups of pretzels and crackers. Therefore, the smallest number of crackers that Karen can pack is 35."

If a customer wants to buy the <fact3>same number of roses</fact3> from both vendors, what is the <fact4>smallest number of roses</fact4> the customer will have to buy from each vendor?

Answer: We are looking for the <fact4>smallest number of roses</fact4> that the customer will have to buy from each vendor. This means we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>9</fact1> and <fact2>19</fact2>. To find the LCM, we can first find the prime factors of each number. The prime factors of <fact1>9</fact1> are 3 * 3, and the prime factors of <fact2>19</fact2> are just 19, since 19 is a prime number. Now, we can find the LCM by multiplying the highest power of each prime factor. In this case, the LCM is 3 * 3 * 19 = 171. Therefore, the <fact4>smallest number of roses</fact4> the customer will have to buy from each vendor is 171."

If they wanted to put them into <fact2>3 boxes</fact2>, with the same number of coats in each box, how many extra coats would they have left over?

Answer: To find the number of extra coats, we need to divide the total number of coats by the number of boxes. The number of coats in each box would be <fact1>29</fact1> / <fact2>3</fact2> = 9.66. Since we can't have a fraction of a coat, we will round down to 9 coats per box. This means the total number of coats used is 9 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 27. To find the number of extra coats, we subtract the number of coats used from the total number of coats: <fact1>29</fact1> - 27 = 2. The answer is {2}."

If each pizza got <fact2>2 pieces</fact2>, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?
Answer: They had <fact1>11 pieces</fact1> in the beginning. If each pizza got <fact2>2 pieces</fact2>, that means each pizza took <fact2>2</fact2> out of the <fact1>11</fact1> pieces. The total number of pizzas is not specified, but since each pizza takes <fact2>2 pieces</fact2>, the total number of pieces taken out is <fact1>11</fact1> / <fact2>2</fact2> = 5.5. Since we can't have half a pizza, this means they had <fact2>5</fact2> full pizzas. The number of pieces taken out for the pizzas is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact2>2</fact2> = 10.

If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?

Answer: The owner wants to put the movies on <fact2>2 shelves</fact2> so that each shelf has the same number of movies. To find out how many movies should be on each shelf, we can divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves. This means we should divide <fact1>9 movies</fact1> by <fact2>2 shelves</fact2>. 9 / 2 = 4.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a movie, the owner would need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5. This means each shelf should have 5 movies. To find out how many more movies he would need, we need to subtract the number of movies he has from the number of movies each shelf should have.

If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?
Answer: To find out how many more tickets they need to buy, we first need to find out how many tickets each friend would get if they split the tickets equally. We can do this by dividing the total number of tickets by the number of friends. The number of tickets each friend would get is <fact2>27</fact2> / <fact1>6</fact1> = 4.5 tickets. However, since we can't divide tickets into fractions, each friend would get 4 tickets. To find out how many tickets they would have in total, we multiply the number of tickets each friend gets by the number of friends. The total number of tickets they would have is 4 * <fact1>6</fact1> = 24 tickets. Since they currently have <fact2>27</fact2> tickets, they would need to return 3 tickets to have 24 tickets.

How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?

Answer: If there are <fact2>2 exhibits</fact2> and we want to split <fact1>15 pictures</fact1> equally between them, we need to divide <fact1>15</fact1> by <fact2>2</fact2>. The result is <fact1>15</fact1> / <fact2>2</fact2> = 7.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a picture, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, the question asks for the number of pictures they need to make sure each exhibit has the same amount, which implies that we want to find the smallest number of pictures that can be divided equally between the two exhibits. In this case, we can simply divide <fact1>15</fact1> by <fact2>2</fact2> and take the floor of the result, which is 7.

Answer: Luke had <fact1>9 pieces of candy</fact1>. He wants to split it into <fact2>2 bags</fact2> with the same amount of candy in each bag. To find out how many pieces would be in each bag, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of bags. This means we need to divide <fact1>9</fact1> by <fact2>2</fact2>. 9 / 2 = 4.5. Since we can't have half a piece of candy, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means each bag would have 5 pieces of candy.

He ended up making <fact2>48 donuts</fact2> and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?

Answer: The baker had <fact1>7 boxes</fact1> for donuts. Since he split the donuts evenly between the boxes, we can find out how many donuts each box has by dividing the total number of donuts by the number of boxes. The total number of donuts is <fact2>48 donuts</fact2>. The number of boxes is <fact1>7 boxes</fact1>. So, each box has <fact2>48</fact2> / <fact1>7</fact1> = 6.86 (round down to 6 because you can't have a fraction of a donut). Since the baker made a whole number of donuts, we can find the total number of donuts by multiplying the number of donuts per box by the number of boxes. The number of donuts per box is 6, and the number of boxes is <fact1>7 boxes</fact1>. So, the total number of donuts is 6 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 42. The baker made <fact2>48 donuts</fact2>, but he only needed 42 to fill the boxes evenly. To find the number of extra donuts, we subtract the total number of donuts needed from the total number of donuts made. The total number of donuts made is <fact2>48 donuts</fact2>, and the total number of donuts needed is 42. So, the number of extra donuts is <fact2>48</fact2> - 42 = 6. The answer is {6}."

If he wants to give each friend the same amount, how many pieces would he have left over?
Answer: If George wants to give each friend the same amount, he will divide the total number of candies by the number of friends. The total number of candies is <fact1>17</fact1> and the number of friends is <fact2>5</fact2>. So, he will divide <fact1>17</fact1> by <fact2>5</fact2>. This will give him 3 candies per friend. To find out how many pieces he will have left over, we need to find out how many candies he has in total that he can give to his friends. Since he can give 3 candies to each friend, and he has <fact2>5 friends</fact2>, he can give a total of 3 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 15 candies to his friends. Since he bought <fact1>17</fact1> candies in the beginning, he will have <fact1>17</fact1> - 15 = 2 candies left over. The answer is {2}."

If they wanted to have <fact2>4 teams</fact2>, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

Answer: They want to have <fact2>4 teams</fact2> with the same number of students on each team. This means they want to divide the students into <fact2>4</fact2> equal groups. To find out how many students should be in each team, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of teams: <fact1>14</fact1> / <fact2>4</fact2> = 3.5. Since you can't have half a student, this means they need to have an equal number of students in each team, which is not possible with the current number of students. They need to have a number of students that is a multiple of 4. The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than 14 is 16. This means they need 16 students in total to have 4 teams with the same number of students on each team.

Answer: Since Lemon heads come in packages of <fact2>5</fact2>, we can divide the total number of Lemon Heads Ann ate, <fact1>78</fact1>, by <fact2>5</fact2> to find the number of packages she ate. This is <fact1>78</fact1> ÷ <fact2>5</fact2> = 15.6. However, since we can't have a fraction of a package, we can round down to 15 packages. This means she ate 15 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 75 Lemon Heads. To find out how many she has left, we subtract the number she ate from the total number. So, <fact1>78</fact1> - 75 = 3. The answer is {3}."

Answer: We need to find out how many Sweettarts Stephen started with. Since Sweettarts come in packages of <fact1>7</fact1>, the number of Sweettarts he started with must be a multiple of <fact1>7</fact1>. To find the largest multiple of <fact1>7</fact1> that is less than or equal to <fact2>64</fact2>, we can divide <fact2>64</fact2> by <fact1>7</fact1> and take the floor of the result. This gives us 64 // 7 = 9. Therefore, Stephen started with 9 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 63 Sweettarts. Now, we can find out how many Sweettarts he has left by subtracting the number of Sweettarts he ate from the number of Sweettarts he started with: 63 - <fact2>64</fact2> = -1. However, this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of Sweettarts. This means that Stephen must have eaten more than 63 Sweettarts. In this case, we can try the next multiple of <fact1>7</fact1>, which is 14 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 98. However, this is still too large since 98 is greater than <fact2>64</fact2>. Therefore, Stephen must have eaten all the Sweettarts in the package he was eating from, which means he must have eaten 63 + 1 = 64 Sweettarts from the package he was eating from, but that would mean he ate more than 64, so he must have eaten from the next package as well. Therefore, he must have eaten 2 packages of Sweettarts, which means he must have eaten 2 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 14 Sweettarts from the second package.

1247,Candies come in packages of 4. Shirley ate 10 candies. How many candies does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Candies come in <fact1>packages of 4</fact1>. Shirley ate <fact2>10 candies</fact2>. How many candies does she have left?
Answer: Since candies come in <fact1>packages of 4</fact1>, that means each package has <fact1>4 candies</fact1>. If Shirley ate <fact2>10 candies</fact2>, we need to find out how many packages she ate. We can do this by dividing <fact2>10</fact2> by <fact1>4</fact1>. This gives us <fact2>10</fact2> / <fact1>4</fact1> = 2.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a package, this means she ate 2 full packages and a half package. Each full package has <fact1>4 candies</fact1>, so she ate 2 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 8 candies from full packages. Since she ate a half package, she ate half of <fact1>4</fact1> = 2 candies from the half package. In total, she ate 8 + 2 = 10 candies from full and half packages. This means she ate all 10 candies, so she has 0 candies left. The answer is {0}."

If the sum of the age of the cousins is <fact6>40</fact6>, find the ages of each.

Answer: Let's denote Bryan's age as B. According to the information, Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's, so Pete's age is B/3. Also, Philip's age is five years elder than Bryan's, so Philip's age is B + 5. The sum of their ages is 40, so we can write the equation: B + B/3 + B + 5 = 40. To solve this equation, we need to combine like terms: 4B/3 + 5 = 40. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 4B/3 = 35. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 4B = 105. Dividing both sides by 4, we get B = 26.25. Now that we know Bryan's age, we can find Pete's and Philip's ages. Pete's age is B/3 = 26.25/3 = 8.75. Philip's age is B + 5 = 26.25 + 5 = 31.25."
1295,Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.,"Reformatted Question: Ana is <fact1>5 years more than Jack</fact1>. The sum of their ages is <fact2>29</fact2>. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.
Answer: Let's denote Jack's age as J and Ana's age as A. We know that A = J + 5 (from <fact1>5 years more than Jack</fact1>). We also know that A + J = 29 (from <fact2>29</fact2>). Substituting A = J + 5 into the second equation, we get J + 5 + J = 29. Combining like terms, we get 2J + 5 = 29. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2J = 24. Dividing both sides by 2, we get J = 12. Now that we know Jack's age, we can find Ana's age by substituting J = 12 into the equation A = J + 5. We get A = 12 + 5 = 17. Therefore, the ages of Ana and Jack are 17 and 12, respectively."
1296,Tina is 3 years younger than Tom. The ages are in the ratio 2:3. Find their ages.,"Reformatted Question: Tina is <fact1>3 years younger</fact1> than Tom. The ages are in the ratio <fact2>2:3</fact2>. Find their ages.

Answer: Let's denote Tina's age as T and Tom's age as t. We know that Tina is 3 years younger than Tom, so we can write an equation: T = t - 3. We also know that the ages are in the ratio 2:3, so we can write another equation: T/t = 2/3. We can substitute the first equation into the second one: (t - 3)/t = 2/3. Cross-multiplying, we get 3t - 9 = 2t. Subtracting 2t from both sides, we get t - 9 = 0. Adding 9 to both sides, we get t = 9. Now that we know Tom's age, we can find Tina's age: T = t - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6. Therefore, their ages are 9 and 6. The answer is {9, 6}."

The sum of their ages is <fact3>60</fact3>. Find the ages of George, Christopher and Ford.

Answer: Let's denote the age of Christopher as C. According to the information in the question, George is <fact1>8 years more than Christopher</fact1>, so the age of George is C + 8. Also, Ford is <fact2>2 years younger than Christopher</fact2>, so the age of Ford is C - 2. The sum of their ages is <fact3>60</fact3>, so we can write the equation: C + (C + 8) + (C - 2) = 60. Simplifying the equation, we get 3C + 6 = 60. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3C = 54. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 18. Now that we know the age of Christopher, we can find the ages of George and Ford. George is <fact1>8 years more than Christopher</fact1>, so the age of George is 18 + 8 = 26. Ford is <fact2>2 years younger than Christopher</fact2>, so the age of Ford is 18 - 2 = 16. The ages of George, Christopher and Ford are 26, 18, and 16 respectively."
1298,Devon is 12 years old. His age is 2 more than half the age of Steven. Find the age of Steven.,"Reformatted Question: Devon is <fact1>12 years old</fact1>. His age is <fact2>2 more than half the age</fact2> of Steven. Find the age of Steven.
Answer: Devon's age is <fact1>12 years old</fact1>. His age is <fact2>2 more than half the age</fact2> of Steven. This means that Devon's age is <fact2>2 more than half</fact2> of Steven's age. Let's call Steven's age <fact3>x</fact3>. Since Devon's age is <fact1>12</fact1>, we can set up the equation: <fact1>12</fact1> = <fact2>2 more than half</fact2> of <fact3>x</fact3>. Half of <fact3>x</fact3> is <fact3>x/2</fact3>. So, the equation becomes: <fact1>12</fact1> = <fact2>2 more than</fact2> <fact3>x/2</fact3>. This can be rewritten as: <fact1>12</fact1> = <fact3>x/2</fact3> + <fact4>2</fact4>. To solve for <fact3>x</fact3>, we need to isolate <fact3>x</fact3> on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting <fact4>2</fact4> from both sides of the equation: <fact1>12</fact1> - <fact4>2</fact4> = <fact3>x/2</fact3>. This simplifies to: <fact5>10</fact5> = <fact3>x/2</fact3>. To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by <fact6>2</fact6>: <fact5>10</fact5> * <fact6>2</fact6> = <fact3>x</fact3>. This simplifies to: <fact7>20</fact7> = <fact3>x</fact3>. Therefore, the age of Steven is <fact7>20</fact7> years old."

The sum of their ages is <fact4>11</fact4>. Find the age of the brothers.
Answer: Since Nick is <fact3>younger</fact3>, let's assume Kane is x years old. This means Nick is x - 1 years old (since they are consecutive years). The sum of their ages is <fact4>11</fact4>, so we can write the equation: x + (x - 1) = 11. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 1 = 11. Adding 1 to both sides, we get 2x = 12. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 6. Since Kane is x years old, Kane is 6 years old. Since Nick is x - 1 years old, Nick is 6 - 1 = 5 years old. The age of the brothers is 5 and 6."

Find the present age of <fact1>Allen</fact1> and <fact3>Scott</fact3>.

Answer: Let's denote the present age of <fact1>Allen</fact1> as A and the present age of <fact3>Scott</fact3> as S. According to the question, A = S - 10 (equation 1). Five years from now, the age of <fact3>Scott</fact3> will be S + 5, and the age of <fact1>Allen</fact1> will be A + 5. According to the question, S + 5 = 2(A + 5) (equation 2). We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to get S + 5 = 2(S - 10 + 5). Simplifying the equation, we get S + 5 = 2S - 10. Subtracting S from both sides, we get 5 = S - 10. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 15 = S. Now we can substitute S into equation 1 to get A = 15 - 10, so A = 5. Therefore, the present age of <fact1>Allen</fact1> is 5 and the present age of <fact3>Scott</fact3> is 15. The answer is {5, 15}."

Answer: In an <fact1>isosceles triangle</fact1>, two sides are equal. This means that the two base angles are also equal. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. One angle is already given as <fact2>54 degrees</fact2>. Let's call the other base angle x. Since the two base angles are equal, the other base angle is also x. The sum of the angles in the triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation: <fact2>54</fact2> + x + x = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get: <fact2>54</fact2> + 2x = 180. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get: 2x = 126. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 63. Since the two base angles are equal, both base angles are 63 degrees."
1343,The zee Theme Park's fountain wall is in the shape of equilateral triangle. The total perimeter of the wall is 51 yards. Find the measure of each side of the wall.,"Reformatted Question: The <fact1>zee Theme Park's fountain wall</fact1> is in the shape of <fact2>equilateral triangle</fact2>. The total <fact3>perimeter of the wall</fact3> is <fact4>51 yards</fact4>. Find the measure of each side of the wall.

Answer: Since the wall is in the shape of <fact2>equilateral triangle</fact2>, all sides of the triangle are equal. Let's call the length of each side <fact5>x</fact5>. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is <fact5>3x</fact5>. We are given that the perimeter is <fact4>51 yards</fact4>, so we can set up the equation <fact5>3x = 51</fact5>. To solve for <fact5>x</fact5>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us <fact5>x = 17</fact5>. Therefore, the measure of each side of the wall is <fact5>17 yards</fact5>."

1346,The angles of a triangle are in the ratio 1:2:3. Find each angle of the triangle.,"Reformatted Question: The angles of a triangle are in the ratio <fact1>1:2:3</fact1>. Find each angle of the triangle.
Answer: Let's represent the angles as <fact2>x</fact2>, <fact3>2x</fact3>, and <fact4>3x</fact4> since they are in the ratio <fact1>1:2:3</fact1>. The sum of the angles of a triangle is always <fact5>180 degrees</fact5>. So, we can set up the equation: <fact2>x</fact2> + <fact3>2x</fact3> + <fact4>3x</fact4> = <fact5>180</fact5>. Combining like terms, we get <fact6>6x</fact6> = <fact5>180</fact5>. To solve for <fact2>x</fact2>, we divide both sides by <fact7>6</fact7>, giving us <fact2>x</fact2> = <fact5>180</fact5> / <fact7>6</fact7> = <fact8>30</fact8>. Now that we know <fact2>x</fact2>, we can find the other two angles by multiplying <fact2>x</fact2> by <fact9>2</fact9> and <fact10>3</fact10>, respectively. So, the angles are <fact11>30</fact11>, <fact12>60</fact12>, and <fact13>90</fact13> degrees. The answer is {30, 60, 90}."
1347,If the second angle is 32 degree less than thrice the first angle and the third angle is 28 degree less than twice the first angle. Find the angles of the triangle.,"Reformatted Question: If the second angle is <fact1>32 degree less than thrice the first angle</fact1> and the third angle is <fact2>28 degree less than twice the first angle</fact2>. Find the angles of the triangle.
Answer: Let's denote the first angle as x. Then, the second angle is <fact1>32 degree less than thrice the first angle</fact1>, which is 3x - 32. The third angle is <fact2>28 degree less than twice the first angle</fact2>, which is 2x - 28. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 32) + (2x - 28) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x - 60 = 180. Adding 60 to both sides, we get 6x = 240. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 40. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the other two angles. The second angle is 3x - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 120 - 32 = 88. The third angle is 2x - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 80 - 28 = 52. Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 40, 88, and 52 degrees."
1349,A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same. The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.,"Reformatted Question: A field is in the shape of an <fact1>equilateral triangle</fact1> attached to the width of a <fact2>rectangular region</fact2> where the <fact3>width of the rectangle</fact3> and the <fact4>side of the triangle</fact4> measures the same. The <fact5>length of the rectangular region</fact5> is <fact6>76 ft</fact6> and the <fact4>side of the triangular region</fact4> measures <fact7>42 ft</fact7>. Find the <fact8>perimeter of the field</fact8>.

Answer: To find the perimeter of the field, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular region and the equilateral triangle and then add them together. 

The perimeter of the rectangular region is the sum of all its sides, which is 2 * (length + width). Since the width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the triangle, we can call it x. The length of the rectangle is given as 76 ft. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular region is 2 * (76 + x).

The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 3 times the length of its side. The side of the triangle is given as 42 ft. Therefore, the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3 * 42.

Now, we need to find the value of x, which is the width of the rectangle. Since the width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the triangle, x = 42.

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangular region by substituting the value of x into the formula: 2 * (76 + 42) = 2 * 118 = 236.

The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3 * 42 =  = 126.

The perimeter of the field is the sum of the perimeter of the rectangular region and the equilateral triangle: 236 + 126 = 362.

The answer is {362}."

1384,Benny sold half of his comic books and then bought 6 more. He now has 17. How many did he begin with ?,"Reformatted Question: Benny sold <fact1>half of his comic books</fact1> and then bought <fact2>6 more</fact2>. He now has <fact3>17</fact3>. How many did he begin with ?
Answer: Let's call the number of comic books Benny began with <fact4>x</fact4>. He sold <fact1>half of his comic books</fact1>, which means he sold <fact1>1/2 * x</fact1> comic books. After selling half of his comic books, he was left with <fact4>x - 1/2 * x</fact4> = <fact4>1/2 * x</fact4> comic books. Then, he bought <fact2>6 more</fact2> comic books, so now he has <fact4>1/2 * x + 6</fact4> comic books. We know that he now has <fact3>17</fact3> comic books, so we can set up the equation <fact4>1/2 * x + 6 = 17</fact4>. To solve for <fact4>x</fact4>, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation, which gives us <fact4>1/2 * x = 11</fact4>.

The next day his dog ate <fact2>half of his collection</fact2>. There are now only <fact3>twenty-six cards left</fact3>. How many cards did Fred start with ?
Answer: Fred bought <fact1>five new baseball trading cards</fact1> to add to his collection. This means he already had some cards in his collection. If he bought <fact1>five new</fact1> cards, he must have had some cards before that. The next day his dog ate <fact2>half of his collection</fact2>. This means that the remaining cards are half of what he had before. There are now only <fact3>twenty-six cards left</fact3>. Since they are half of what he had before, the total number of cards he had before his dog ate half of them must have been <fact3>26</fact3> * 2 = 52 cards. Since he bought <fact1>five new</fact1> cards to add to his collection, he must have had <fact3>52</fact3> - <fact1>5</fact1> = 47 cards before buying the five new cards. The answer is {47}."
1386,Jessica spent half of her allowance going to the movies. She washed the family car and earned six dollars.

She washed the family car and earned <fact2>six dollars</fact2>. What is her weekly allowance if she ended with <fact3>eleven dollars</fact3>?

Answer: We know that Jessica ended with <fact3>eleven dollars</fact3> after spending <fact1>half of her allowance</fact1> and earning <fact2>six dollars</fact2>. To find her weekly allowance, we need to find the amount she had before earning the six dollars, which is <fact3>eleven dollars</fact3> - <fact2>six dollars</fact2> = five dollars. This is the amount she had before earning the six dollars, but we need to find her weekly allowance, which is the amount she had before spending <fact1>half of her allowance</fact1>. Let's call her weekly allowance x. We know that she spent <fact1>half of her allowance</fact1>, which is x/2, and she ended with <fact3>eleven dollars</fact3>. We also know that she earned <fact2>six dollars</fact2> and had five dollars before earning the six dollars. So, we can set up the equation: x - x/2 = 5 + 6. To solve for x, we can first simplify the equation: x/2 = 11. Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get x = 22. Therefore, Jessica's weekly allowance is $22."

1389,The sum of three consecutive numbers is 90. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?,"Reformatted Question: The sum of <fact1>three consecutive numbers</fact1> is <fact2>90</fact2>. What is the smallest of the <fact3>three numbers</fact3> ?
Answer: Let's denote the smallest number as <fact3>1</fact3>. Since the numbers are consecutive, the next number will be <fact3>1</fact3> + <fact4>1</fact4> = <fact3>2</fact3> and the largest number will be <fact3>2</fact3> + <fact4>1</fact4> = <fact3>3</fact3>. The sum of these three numbers is <fact3>1</fact3> + <fact3>2</fact3> + <fact3>3</fact3> = <fact2>6</fact2>. Since the sum of the three consecutive numbers is given as <fact2>90</fact2>, we can set up the equation <fact3>1</fact3> + <fact3>2</fact3> + <fact3>3</fact3> = <fact2>90</fact2> and solve for <fact3>1</fact3>. However, this equation is not correct. Let's try again. Let the smallest number be <fact3>x</fact3>. Then the next number will be <fact3>x</fact3> + <fact4>1</fact4> and the largest number will be <fact3>x</fact3> + <fact4>2</fact4>. The sum of these three numbers is <fact3>x</fact3> + (<fact3>x</fact3> + <fact4>1</fact4>) + (<fact3>x</fact3> + <fact4>2</fact4>) = <fact2>90</fact2>. Simplifying this equation, we get <fact3>3x</fact3> + <fact4>3</fact4> = <fact2>90</fact2>. Subtracting <fact4>3</fact4> from both sides, we get <fact3>3x</fact3> = <fact2>87</fact2>.

If the number of girls is <fact2>106 more</fact2> than the boys, how many boys are there in the school?
Answer: Let's denote the number of boys as B. According to the question, the number of girls is <fact2>106 more</fact2> than the boys, so the number of girls is B + <fact2>106</fact2>. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is B + (B + <fact2>106</fact2>). We are given that the total number of students is <fact1>650</fact1>, so we can write the equation: B + (B + <fact2>106</fact2>) = <fact1>650</fact1>. Simplifying the equation, we get 2B + <fact2>106</fact2> = <fact1>650</fact1>. Subtracting <fact2>106</fact2> from both sides, we get 2B = <fact1>650</fact1> - <fact2>106</fact2> = 544.

1393,"A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.","Reformatted Question: A man is <fact1>thrice as old as his son</fact1>. After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, he will be <fact3>twice as old as his son</fact3>. Find their <fact4>present ages</fact4>.

Answer: Let's denote the son's current age as x. Since the man is <fact1>thrice as old as his son</fact1>, the man's current age is 3x. After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, the son's age will be x + 12 and the man's age will be 3x + 12. According to the problem, after <fact2>12 years</fact2>, he will be <fact3>twice as old as his son</fact3>, so we can write the equation: 3x + 12 = 2(x + 12). We can simplify this equation to find the value of x, which represents the son's current age. Solving for x, we get: 3x + 12 = 2x + 24, 3x - 2x = 24 - 12, x = 12. Now that we know the son's current age is 12, we can find the man's current age by substituting x into the expression 3x. The man's current age is 3 * 12 = 36. Therefore, the present ages of the man and his son are 36 and 12, respectively."

Find Vidya's present age, if her mother is <fact3>44 years old</fact3>.

Answer: Vidya's mother is <fact3>44 years old</fact3>. This means her mother's age is <fact1>5 years more</fact1> than Vidya's age. Let's call Vidya's age <fact4>x</fact4>. Then, <fact2>three times</fact2> of Vidya's age is 3x. According to the question, Vidya's mother's age is 5 years more than 3x, which means 3x + 5 = 44. To find Vidya's age, we need to solve for x. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 44 - 5, 3x = 39. Now, divide both sides by 3: x = 39 / 3, x = 13. Therefore, Vidya's present age is 13."
1395,Sachin says that he has 6 books more than the 6 times of the books Priyanka has. Sachin has 42 books.

Answer: We know that <fact1>x lollipops</fact1> were bought by Sushi's father. <fact2>5 were eaten</fact2>, so the number of lollipops left is <fact1>x</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2>. We are given that <fact3>7 lollipops are left</fact3>. Therefore, we can write the equation <fact1>x</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact3>7</fact3>. To find the value of <fact1>x</fact1>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding <fact2>5</fact2> to both sides of the equation, which gives us <fact1>x</fact1> = <fact3>7</fact3> + <fact2>5</fact2>.

Answer: Let's denote Ariel's present age as <fact3>x</fact3>. According to the question, after <fact1>15 years</fact1>, Ariel will be <fact2>four times as old</fact2> as she is now. This means that her age after <fact1>15 years</fact1> will be <fact3>4x</fact3>. Since she is currently <fact3>x</fact3> years old, after <fact1>15 years</fact1>, she will be <fact3>x + 15</fact3> years old. According to the question, after <fact1>15 years</fact1>, Ariel will be <fact2>four times as old</fact2> as she is now. Therefore, we can write the equation <fact3>x + 15 = 4x</fact3>.

Find their present ages.,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Martin is <fact1>27 years older than her daughter Neil</fact1>. After <fact2>8 years</fact2> she will be <fact3>twice as old as Neil</fact3>. Find their present ages.
Answer: Let's denote Neil's present age as N. Since Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than Neil, her present age is N + 27. After 8 years, Neil's age will be N + 8 and Mrs. Martin's age will be (N + 27) + 8 = N + 35. According to the problem, after 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil, so we can write the equation: N + 35 = 2(N + 8). Solving this equation, we get N + 35 = 2N + 16, 35 - 16 = 2N - N, 19 = N. Therefore, Neil's present age is 19 and Mrs. Martin's present age is 19 + 27 = 46. The answer is {19, 46}."
1400,"In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The vertex angle is twice either base angle. What are the angles of the triangle?","Reformatted Question: In an <fact1>isosceles triangle</fact1>, the <fact2>base angles</fact2> are equal. The <fact3>vertex angle</fact3> is <fact4>twice either base angle</fact4>. What are the angles of the triangle?

Answer: Let's call the base angles <fact5>x</fact5> and the vertex angle <fact6>y</fact6>. According to the question, the base angles are equal, so we can write an equation: <fact5>x</fact5> = <fact5>x</fact5>. This equation is true for any value of <fact5>x</fact5>, but we can't find the value of <fact5>x</fact5> from this equation alone.

However, we know that the vertex angle is twice either base angle, so we can write another equation: <fact6>y</fact6> = 2 * <fact5>x</fact5>. We can substitute this expression for <fact6>y</fact6> into the equation for the sum of the angles of a triangle: <fact5>x</fact5> + <fact5>x</fact5> + 2 * <fact5>x</fact5> = 180. Simplifying this equation, we get: 4 * <fact5>x</fact5> = 180. Solving for <fact5>x</fact5>, we get: <fact5>x</fact5> = 45.

Now that we know the value of <fact5>x</fact5>, we can find the value of <fact6>y</fact6> by substituting it into the equation: <fact6>y</fact6> = 2 * <fact5>x</fact5> = 2 * 45 = 90.

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are: <fact5>x</fact5> = 45, <fact5>x</fact5> = 45, and <fact6>y</fact6> = 90."

The second boy arranges the marbles in heaps of 9, so the number of heaps is (480 - x) / 9.

We are given that the total number of heaps is 72, so we can set up the equation:

x / 6 + (480 - x) / 9 = 72

To solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 18 to eliminate the fractions:

3x + 2(480 - x) = 1296

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 960 - 2x = 1296

Combine like terms:

x + 960 = 1296

Subtract 960 from both sides:

x = 336

So the first boy has 336 marbles. The second boy has 480 - 336 = 144 marbles.

The answer is {336, 144}."
1403,"The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. After 5 years, sum of their ages would be 70 years. Find their present ages.","Reformatted Question: The present age of <fact1>Jacob's father</fact1> is <fact2>three times that of Jacob</fact2>. After <fact3>5 years</fact3>, the sum of their ages would be <fact4>70 years</fact4>. Find their present ages.

Answer: Let's denote Jacob's present age as J and Jacob's father's present age as F. According to the information, F = 3J (as the present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob). After 5 years, their ages will be J + 5 and F + 5 respectively. The sum of their ages after 5 years would be (J + 5) + (F + 5) = 70. We can substitute F = 3J in this equation to get (J + 5) + (3J + 5) = 70. Simplifying this equation, we get 4J + 10 = 70. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 4J = 60. Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 15. Now that we know Jacob's present age is 15, we can find Jacob's father's present age by substituting J = 15 in F = 3J. This gives us F = 3 * 15 = 45. Therefore, Jacob's present age is 15 and Jacob's father's present age is 45. The answer is {15, 45}."

If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.","Reformatted Question: The length of a rectangle is <fact1>8 m less than twice its width</fact1>. If the <fact2>perimeter of the rectangle</fact2> is <fact3>56 m</fact3>, find its <fact4>length</fact4> and <fact5>width</fact5>.

Answer: Let's denote the width of the rectangle as <fact5>w</fact5>. According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is <fact1>8 m less than twice its width</fact1>, so it can be expressed as <fact4>2w - 8</fact4>. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula <fact2>perimeter = 2(length + width)</fact2>. We are given that the <fact2>perimeter of the rectangle</fact2> is <fact3>56 m</fact3>, so we can write the equation <fact3>56 = 2(2w - 8 + w)</fact3>. Simplifying the equation, we get <fact3>56 = 2(3w - 8)</fact3>, which further simplifies to <fact3>56 = 6w - 16</fact3>. Adding 16 to both sides of the equation, we get <fact3>72 = 6w</fact3>. Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get <fact5>w = 12</fact5>.

1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","Reformatted Question: Five years hence, the age of <fact1>Jacob</fact1> will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, <fact2>Jacob's age</fact2> was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?

Answer: Let's denote the present age of Jacob as J and the present age of his son as S. 

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. This can be expressed as: J + 5 = 3 * (S + 5)

2. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. This can be expressed as: J - 5 = 7 * (S - 5)

Now, let's simplify the first equation: J + 5 = 3 * (S + 5) 
=> J + 5 = 3S + 15 
=> J = 3S + 10

Now, let's simplify the second equation: J - 5 = 7 * (S - 5) 
=> J - 5 = 7S - 35 
=> J = 7S - 30

Since both equations are equal to J, we can equate them: 
3S + 10 = 7S - 30

Now, let's solve for S: 
3S - 7S = -30 - 10 
=> -4S = -40 
=> S = 10

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the value of J: 
J = 3S + 10 
=> J = 3 * 10 + 10 
=> J = 30 + 10 
=> J = 40

Therefore, the present ages of Jacob and his son are 40 and 10 respectively."
1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Reformatted Question: Five years ago, I was <fact1>thrice as old as my son</fact1> and <fact2>ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son</fact2>. How old are we now?
Answer: Let's denote my current age as A and my son's current age as S. 

Five years ago, I was <fact1>thrice as old as my son</fact1>, so A - 5 = 3(S - 5). This can be rewritten as A - 5 = 3S - 15, and then A = 3S - 10.

Ten years later, I shall be <fact2>twice as old as my son</fact2>, so A + 10 = 2(S + 10). This can be rewritten as A + 10 = 2S + 20, and then A = 2S + 10.

Since A = 3S - 10 and A = 2S + 10, we can equate the two expressions: 3S - 10 = 2S + 10. Subtracting 2S from both sides gives S - 10 = 10. Adding 10 to both sides gives S = 20.

Now that we know S = 20, we can substitute this value into one of the expressions for A: A = 3S - 10. A = 3(20) - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50.

Therefore, my current age is 50 and my son's current age is 20."
1408,A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,"Reformatted Question: A is two years older than B. <fact1>A's father D is twice as old as A</fact1> and <fact2>B is twice as old as his sister C</fact2>. The ages of <fact3>D and C</fact3> differ by <fact4>40 years</fact4>. Find the ages of <fact5>A and B</fact5>.

Answer: Let's denote the age of A as 'a' and the age of B as 'b'. We are given that A is two years older than B, so we can write an equation: a = b + 2.

We are also given that A's father D is twice as old as A, so we can write another equation: D = 2a.

Furthermore, we are given that B is twice as old as his sister C, so we can write another equation: b = 2C.

The ages of D and C differ by 40 years, so we can write another equation: D - C = 40.

Now we can substitute the expressions for D and b into the last equation: 2a - C = 40.

We can also substitute the expression for a into this equation: 2(b + 2) - C = 40.

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 2b + 4 - C = 40.

Combine like terms: 2b - C = 36.

Now we can substitute the expression for b into this equation: 2(2C) - C = 36.

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 4C - C = 36.

Combine like terms: 3C = 36.

Divide both sides by 3: C = 12.

Now that we know the age of C, we can find the age of B: b = 2C = 2(12 = 24.

Finally, we can find the age of A: a = b + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26.

The answer is {A = 26, B = 24}."
1409,"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son. Find the present ages of father and son.","Reformatted Question: Two years ago, a father was <fact1>five times as old as his son</fact1>. Two years later, his age will be <fact2>8 more than the age of the son</fact2>. Find the present ages of father and son.
Answer: Let's denote the present age of the son as S and the present age of the father as F. Two years ago, the son's age was S - 2 and the father's age was F - 2. According to the information, two years ago, the father was five times as old as his son, so we can write the equation: F - 2 = 5 * (S - 2). 

We can simplify this equation by expanding the right-hand side: F - 2 = 5S - 10. Now, let's add 2 to both sides of the equation to get F = 5S - 8.

Now, let's consider the second piece of information: two years later, the father's age will be 8 more than the age of the son. This means that F + 2 = S + 2 + 8. 

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 2 from both sides: F = S + 6.

Now we have two equations: F = 5S - 8 and F = S + 6. We can equate the right-hand sides of these two equations to get 5S - 8 = S + 6.

Now, let's add 8 to both sides of the equation to get 5S = S + 14. 

Next, let's subtract S from both sides of the equation to get 4S = 14. 

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get S = 3.5.

Now that we know the son's age, we can find the father's age using the equation F = S + 6. F = 3.5 + 6 = 9.5.

Therefore, the present ages of the father and son are 9.5 and 3.5 respectively."
1410,Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the age of father.,"Reformatted Question: Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. If we let the sum of the ages of his two children be <fact1>S</fact1>, then Father's age is <fact2>3S</fact2>. After 5 years, Father's age will be twice the sum of age of two children.

1411,5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.,"Reformatted Question: 5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son [fact1] while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son [fact2]. Find the present ages [fact3].
Answer: Let's denote the present age of the father as F and the present age of the son as S. 

According to [fact1], 5 years hence, the age of the father will be F + 5 and the age of the son will be S + 5. It is given that the age of the father will be three times the age of the son, so we can write the equation: F + 5 = 3(S + 5).

Expanding the equation, we get: F + 5 = 3S + 15.

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get: F = 3S + 10. [equation1]

According to [fact2], 5 years earlier, the age of the father was F - 5 and the age of the son was S - 5. It is given that the age of the father was 7 times the age of the son, so we can write the equation: F - 5 = 7(S - 5).

Expanding the equation, we get: F - 5 = 7S - 35.

Adding 5 to both sides, we get: F = 7S - 30. [equation2]

Now we have two equations: [equation1] and [equation2]. We can equate the two expressions for F: 3S + 10 = 7S - 30.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 10 = 4S - 30.

Adding 30 to both sides, we get: 40 = 4S.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: S = 10. [equation3]

Now that we have the value of S, we can substitute it into [equation1] to find F: F = 3(10) + 10.

Multiplying 3 and 10, we get: F = 30 + 10.

Adding 30 and 10, we get: F = 40.

So, the present ages of the father and son are 40 and 10, respectively."
1412,The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children. After 15 years sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. Find the age of the father.,"Reformatted Question: The age of a <fact1>father</fact1> is equal to the sum of the ages of his <fact2>5 children</fact2>. After <fact3>15 years</fact3>, sum of the ages of the <fact2>children</fact2> will be <fact4>twice the age of the father</fact4>. Find the age of the <fact1>father</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the current age of the father as F and the current age of each child as C. According to the problem, F = 5C (equation 1). After 15 years, the age of the father will be F + 15, and the age of each child will be C + 15. According to the problem, 5(C + 15) = 2(F + 15) (equation 2). Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute F from equation 1 into equation 2: 5(C + 15) = 2(5C + 15). Expanding both sides, we get 5C + 75 = 10C + 30. Subtracting 5C from both sides, we get 75 = 5C + 30. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 45 = 5C. Dividing both sides by 5, we get C = 9. Now we can find F by substituting C into equation 1: F = 5C = 5 * 9 = 45. The answer is {45}."
1413,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.","Reformatted Question: Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was <fact1>one-third of their father's age</fact1>. One son is <fact2>two years older than the other</fact2> and the sum of their present ages is <fact3>14 years less than the father's present age</fact3>. Find the present ages of all.

Answer: Let's denote the age of the younger son as x. Since one son is two years older than the other, the age of the older son is x + 2. Ten years ago, the sum of their ages was x - 10 + (x + 2 - 10) = 2x - 18. According to the question, this sum is one-third of their father's age ten years ago, which is (1/3)(father's age ten years ago). So, we have the equation 2x - 18 = (1/3)(father's age ten years ago). 

We also know that the sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. This means that the sum of their present ages is (father's present age) - 14. Since their present ages are x and x + 2, we have the equation x + (x + 2) = (father's present age) - 14. 

Now we have two equations and three variables. We can start by expressing the father's age ten years ago in terms of the father's present age. Let's denote the father's present age as F. Then, the father's age ten years ago is F - 10. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 2x - 18 = (1/3)(F - 10). 

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us 6x - 54 = F - 10. 

Now we have the equation 6x - 54 = F - 10. We can also express the father's present age in terms of x by using the second equation. We have x + (x + 2) = F - 14. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 2 = F - 14. 

We can now substitute F - 14 for 2x + 2 in the equation 6x - 54 = F - 10. This gives us 6x - 54 = F - 14 - 10. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get 6x - 54 = F - 24. 

Now we have the equation 6x - 54 = F - 24. We can add 54 to both sides of the equation to get 6x = F + 30. 

We can now substitute F + 30 for 6x in the equation 2x + 2 = F - 14. This gives us 2(F + 30) + 2 = F - 14. 

Expanding the left-hand side, we get 2F + 60 + 2 = F - 14. Combining like terms, we get 2F + 62 = F - 14. 

Subtracting F from both sides of the equation, we get F + 62 = -14. Subtracting 62 from both sides of the equation, we get F = -76. 

Now that we have the father's present age, we can find the present ages of the sons. We have the equation x + (x + 2) = F - 14. Substituting F = -76, we get x + (x + 2) = -76 - 14. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get x + (x + 2) = -90. 

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 2 = -90. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = -92. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = -46. 

Since one son is two years older than the other, the age of the older son is x + 2 = -46 + 2 = -44. 

The present ages of the sons are -46 and - 44 = -90."
1414,"If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95.

But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is <fact2>95</fact2>. Find the ages of father and son.
Answer: Let's denote the son's age as <fact3>S</fact3> and the father's age as <fact4>F</fact4>. According to the problem, we have two equations: <fact5>2S + F = 70</fact5> and <fact6>2F + S = 95</fact6>. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of <fact3>S</fact3> and <fact4>F</fact4>. 

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to get <fact7>4S + 2F = 140</fact7>. Now we have two equations: <fact8>4S + 2F = 140</fact8> and <fact9>2F + S = 95</fact9>.

Now that we know the son's age, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the father's age. Let's use the second equation: <fact12>2F + S = 95</fact12>. Substituting <fact11>S = 15</fact11> into this equation, we get <fact13>2F + 15 = 95</fact13>. Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get <fact14>2F = 80</fact14>. Dividing both sides by 2, we get <fact15>F = 40</fact15>. 

Therefore, the ages of the father and son are <fact16>40</fact16> and <fact17>15</fact17> respectively."

How old am I and how old is my son?
Answer: Let's denote my current age as A and my son's current age as B. From the first statement, we have A = 3B. Now, let's consider the situation five years later. In five years, my age will be A + 5 and my son's age will be B + 5. According to the second statement, in five years, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son, so we have A + 5 = 2.5(B + 5). Now we have two equations: A = 3B and A + 5 = 2.5(B + 5). We can substitute the first equation into the second one to get 3B + 5 = 2.5(B + 5). Simplifying this equation, we get 3B + 5 = 2.5B + 12.5. Subtracting 2.5B from both sides, we get 0.5B + 5 = 12.5. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 0.5B = 7.5. Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get B = 15. Now that we know B, we can find A using the equation A = 3B. A = 3 * 15 = 45. Therefore, I am 45 years old and my son is 15 years old."
1416,The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.,"Reformatted Question: The sum total of the ages of <fact1>father</fact1> and the <fact2>son</fact2> is <fact3>55 years</fact3>. If the <fact1>father</fact1> was to live till his <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals his present age, the total of their ages would be <fact4>93 years</fact4>. Find their present ages.

Answer: Let's denote the present age of the <fact1>father</fact1> as F and the present age of the <fact2>son</fact2> as S. According to the question, F + S = <fact3>55 years</fact3>. (1) Now, if the <fact1>father</fact1> lives till his <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals his present age, then the <fact2>son's age</fact2> would be F and the <fact1>father's age</fact1> would still be F. Therefore, the total of their ages would be F + F = <fact4>93 years</fact4>. (2) From equation (1), we can express S as S = <fact3>55 years</fact3> - F. Substituting this value of S in equation (2), we get F + (<fact3>55 years</fact3> - F) = <fact4>93 years</fact4>. Simplifying the equation, we get <fact3>55 years</fact3> = <fact4>93 years</fact4>. This is not possible as the ages of the <fact1>father</fact1> and the <fact2>son</fact2> cannot be equal. Therefore, the equation F + F = <fact4>93 years</fact4> is not possible. The only possibility of this equation is that the <fact1>father</fact1> lives for more years than the <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals his present age. This is not possible. The other possibility is that the <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals the <fact1>father's age</fact1> before the <fact1>father</fact1> lives till his <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals his present age. This is possible. Therefore, the equation F + F = <fact4>93 years</fact4> is possible when the <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals the <fact1>father's age</fact1> before the <fact1>father</fact1> lives till his <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals his present age. Let's denote the age of the <fact2>son</fact2> when his age equals the <fact1>father's age</fact1> as x. Therefore, the age of the <fact1>father</fact1> when his age equals the <fact2>son's age</fact2> is also x. Now, the total age of the <fact1>father</fact1> and the <fact2>son</fact2> when the <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals the <fact1>father's age</fact1> is x + x = 2x. According to the question, 2x = <fact4>93 years</fact4>. (3) From equation (1), we can express F as F = <fact3>55 years</fact3> - S. When the <fact2>son's age</fact2> equals the <fact1>father's age</fact1>, S = x. Therefore, F = <fact3>55 years</fact3> - x. (4) Now, we have two equations, (3) and (4). We can substitute the value of 2x from equation (3) in equation (4). Therefore, F = <fact3>55 years</fact3> - (<fact4>93 years</fact4> / 2). Simplifying the equation, F = <fact3>55 years</fact3> - <fact4>46.5 years</fact4>. Therefore, F = <fact3>8.5 years</fact3>. The age of the <fact1>father</fact1> is <fact3>8.5 years</fact3>. Now, we can find the age of the <fact2>son</fact2>. According to the question, F + S = <fact3>55 years</fact3>. (1) We have found that F = <fact3>8.5 years</fact3>. Therefore, S = <fact3>55 years</fact3> - <fact3>8."

Answer: Let's denote the age of Anna as A. Then the age of Ben is A + 3. Since Ben is twice as old as Cathy, Cathy's age is (A + 3) / 2. According to the information, Denver's age is twice as old as Anna, so Denver's age is 2A. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years, so we can write the equation: 2A - (A + 3) / 2 = 30. To solve this equation, we first multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4A - (A + 3) = 60. Then we simplify the equation: 4A - A - 3 = 60. This becomes 3A - 3 = 60. Now we add 3 to both sides: 3A = 63. Finally, we divide both sides by 3: A = 21. Now that we know Anna's age, we can find Ben's age: Ben's age = A + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24. The answer is {21, 24}."
1418,"Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?","Reformatted Question: Five years ago, Nancy was <fact1>thrice as old as Sam</fact1>. Ten years later, Nancy will be <fact2>twice as old as Sam</fact2>. How old are Nancy and Sam?
Answer: Let's denote Nancy's current age as N and Sam's current age as S. According to the first statement, five years ago, Nancy was N - 5 years old, and Sam was S - 5 years old. Since Nancy was thrice as old as Sam five years ago, we can write the equation:

N - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

N - 5 = 3S - 15

Add 5 to both sides of the equation:

N = 3S - 10

According to the second statement, ten years later, Nancy will be N + 10 years old, and Sam will be S + 10 years old. Since Nancy will be twice as old as Sam ten years later, we can write the equation:

N + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

N + 10 = 2S + 20

Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

N = 2S + 10

Now we have two equations with N and S:

N = 3S - 10
N = 2S + 10

Since both equations are equal to N, we can set them equal to each other:

3S - 10 = 2S + 10

Add 10 to both sides of the equation:

3S = 2S + 20

Subtract 2S from both sides of the equation:

S = 20

Now that we know S, we can find N using the first equation:

N = 3S - 10
N = 3(20) - 10
N = 60 - 10
N = 50

Therefore, Nancy is 50 years old, and Sam is 20 years old."
1419,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.,"Reformatted Question: Seven times a two digit number is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.
Answer: Let's denote the two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit. According to the problem, the sum of the digits is 3, so we have a + b = 3 (1). The number obtained by reversing the order of digits is 10b + a. Seven times the original number is 7(10a + b), and four times the reversed number is 4(10b + a). According to the problem, these two expressions are equal, so we have 7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a) (2). We can simplify equation (2) to 70a + 7b = 40b + 4a (3). Rearranging equation (3), we get 70a - 4a = 40b - 7b, which simplifies to 66a = 33b (4). We can divide both sides of equation (4) by 33 to get 2a = b (5). Now we can substitute equation (5) into equation (1) to get a + 2a = 3, which simplifies to 3a = 3. Dividing both sides by 3, we get a = 1. Substituting a = 1 into equation (5), we get b = 2. Therefore, the two-digit number is 10(1) + 2 = 12. The answer is {12}."

1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9.

If the digits are <fact3>reversed</fact3>, the number is <fact4>increased by 9</fact4>. Find the number.

Answer: Let's denote the tens digit as x and the units digit as y. We know that x + y = <fact2>9</fact2> (1). 

Since the number is a two-digit number, x must be greater than or equal to 1 and y must be greater than or equal to 0. 

When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10y + x. According to the problem, this new number is <fact4>increased by 9</fact4> compared to the original number, which is 10x + y. So, we can write the equation as (10y + x) - (10x + y) = 9 (2).

We can simplify equation (2) as 10y + x - 10x - y = 9, which becomes -9x + 9y = 9 (3).

We can rewrite equation (3) as -9x + 9y - 9 = 0, and then factor out 9 as 9(-x + y - 1) = 0 (4).

From equation (4), we have -x + y - 1 = 0 (5).

Now we have two equations (1) and (5). We can solve them simultaneously. 

From equation (1), we have x + y = 9 (6).

From equation (5), we have y - x = 1 (7).

We can add equation (6) and equation (7) to eliminate x: (x + y) + (y - x) = 9 + 1, which simplifies to 2y = 10, and y = 5 (8).

Now we substitute y = 5 into equation (6) to solve for x: x + 5 = 9, which simplifies to x = 4 (9).

Since x is the tens digit and y is the units digit, the number is 45.

The answer is {45}."

Answer: Let's denote the original number as <fact3>AB</fact3>, where <fact3>A</fact3> is the tens digit and <fact3>B</fact3> is the ones digit. The sum of the digits is <fact1>15</fact1>, so we have <fact3>A + B = 15</fact3>. When the number is decreased by <fact2>27</fact2>, the new number is <fact3>(A - 2)(B - 2)</fact3>, since <fact3>AB</fact3> is decreased by <fact2>27</fact2>, which is a two-digit number. When the digits are reversed, the new number becomes <fact3>(B - 2)(A - 2)</fact3>. Since the number is decreased by <fact2>27</fact2>, we have <fact3>(A - 2)(B - 2) = AB - 27</fact3>. Expanding the left-hand side, we get <fact3>AB - 2A - 2B + 4 = AB - 27</fact3>. Simplifying, we get <fact3>-2A - 2B + 4 = -27</fact3>. Rearranging, we get <fact3>2A + 2B = 31</fact3>. Since <fact3>A + B = 15</fact3>, we can substitute <fact3>B = 15 - A</fact3> into the equation <fact3>2A + 2B = 31</fact3>. We get <fact3>2A + 2(15 - A) = 31</fact3>. Expanding, we get <fact3>2A + 30 - 2A = 31</fact3>. Simplifying, we get <fact3>-A + 30 = 31</fact3>. Rearranging, we get <fact3>-A = 1</fact3>. Multiplying both sides by <fact3>-1</fact3>, we get <fact3>A = -1</fact3>. Since <fact3>A</fact3> is the tens digit, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we must have <fact3>A = 9</fact3>. Substituting <fact3>A = 9</fact3> into <fact3>A + B = 15</fact3>, we get <fact3>9 + B = 15</fact3>. Solving for <fact3>B</fact3>, we get <fact3>B = 6</fact3>.

Answer: Let's denote the tens digit as <fact6>t</fact6> and the unit digit as <fact7>u</fact7>. According to the problem, <fact2>t</fact2> is <fact3>three times the unit digit</fact3>, so <fact6>t = 3u</fact6>. The two-digit number is then <fact8>10t + u</fact8>. When this number is <fact4>decreased by 54</fact4>, we get <fact9>10t + u - 54</fact9>. The problem states that when this number is decreased by 54, the <fact5>digits are reversed</fact5>, so the reversed number is <fact10>10u + t</fact10>. Equating the two expressions, we get <fact9>10t + u - 54 = 10u + t</fact9>. Rearranging the equation, we get <fact11>9t - 9u = 54</fact11>.

Since the number is a <fact1>two-digit number</fact1>, we have <fact2>0 < a < 10</fact2> and <fact3>0 < b < 10</fact3>. The sum of the digits is <fact4>8</fact4>, so we have <fact1>a + b = 8</fact1>. The difference between the number and that formed by <fact3>reversing the digits</fact3> is <fact4>18</fact4>, so we have <fact1>10a + b - (10b + a) = 18</fact1>, which simplifies to <fact1>9a - 9b = 18</fact1> or <fact1>a - b = 2</fact1>.

1426,"A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.","Reformatted Question: A boat goes <fact1>30 km upstream</fact1> and <fact2>44 km downstream</fact2> in <fact3>10 hours</fact3>. In <fact4>13 hours</fact4>, it can go <fact5>40 km upstream</fact5> and <fact6>55 km downstream</fact6>. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.

Answer: Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as B and the speed of the stream as S. 

When the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is B - S. When it goes downstream, its effective speed is B + S. 

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. 30 / (B - S) + 44 / (B + S) = 10
2. 40 / (B - S) + 55 / (B + S) = 13

To simplify the equations, we can multiply both sides of each equation by (B - S)(B + S), which is the least common multiple of the denominators:

1. 30(B + S) + 44(B - S) = 10(B^2 - S^2)
2. 40(B + S) + 55(B - S) = 13(B^2 - S^2)

Expanding and simplifying the equations:

1. 30B + 30S + 44B - 44S = 10B^2 - 10S^2
2. 40B + 40S + 55B - 55S = 13B^2 - 13S^2

Combine like terms:

1. 74B - 14S = 10B^2 - 10S^2
2. 95B -  - 15S = 13B^2 - 13S^2

Now we can rearrange the equations to make them easier to work with:

1. 10B^2 - 10S^2 - 74B + 14S = 0
2. 13B^2 - 13S^2 - 95B + 15S = 0

Divide both sides of each equation by the greatest common factor to simplify:

1. 5B^2 - 5S^2 - 37B + 7S = 0
2. 13B^2 - 13S^2 - 73B + 15S = 0

Now we can solve this system of equations. To do this, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 13 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of B^2 and S^2 the same:

1. 65B^2 - 65S^2 - 481B + 91S = 0
2. 65B^2 - 65S^2 - 365B + 75S = 0

Now we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the B^2 and S^2 terms:

(65B^2 - 65S^2 - 481B + 91S) - (65B^2 - 65S^2 - 365B + 75S) = 0 - 0

This simplifies to:

-116B + 16S = 0

Now we can solve for S in terms of B:

16S = 116B
S = 116B / 16
S = 29B / 4

Now we can substitute this expression for S into one of the original equations to solve for B. Let's use the first equation:

30 / (B - S) + 44 / (B + S) = 10

Substitute S = 29B / 4 into this equation:

30 / (B - 29B / 4) + 44 / (B + 29B / 4) = 10

Simplify the denominators:

30 / ((4B - 29B) / 4) + 44 / ((4B + 29B) / 4) = 10

This simplifies to:

30 / (-25B / 4) + 44 / (33B / 4) = 10

Now we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fractions:

120 / (-25B) + 176 / (33B) = 40

Now we can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

120 * 33B + 176 * (-25B) = 40 * (-25B * 33B)

This simplifies to:

3960B - 4400B = -3300B^2

Find her speed of rowing in <fact6>still water</fact6> and the speed of the <fact7>current</fact7>.

Answer: To find the speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current, we can use the following formulas:

Speed of rowing in still water = (Speed downstream + Speed upstream) / 2
Speed of the current = (Speed downstream - Speed upstream) / 2

We are given that Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. To find the speed, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time.

Speed downstream = 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/h
Speed upstream = 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/h

Now, we can use the formulas to find the speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current:

Speed of rowing in still water = (10 km/h + 2 km/h) / 2 = 6 km/h
Speed of the current = (10 km/h - 2 km/h) / 2 = 4 km/h

The answer is {6, 4}."
1428,A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.,"Reformatted Question: A sailor goes <fact1>8 km downstream</fact1> in <fact2>40 minutes</fact2> and comes back in <fact3>1 hour</fact3>. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.

Answer: We need to determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of the current. To do this, we can use the concept of relative speed. When the sailor goes downstream, the speed of the current adds to the speed of the sailor, and when the sailor comes back upstream, the speed of the current subtracts from the speed of the sailor.

Let's denote the speed of the sailor in still water as 's' and the speed of the current as 'c'. We can use the formula:

Downstream speed = s + c
Upstream speed = s - c

We know that the sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes, so we can calculate the downstream speed as follows:

Downstream speed = Distance / Time
= 8 km / (40/60) hours
= 12 km/h

We also know that the sailor comes back in 1 hour, so we can calculate the upstream speed as follows:

Upstream speed = Distance / Time
= 8 km / 1 hour
= 8 km/h

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 's' and 'c' by substituting the values of downstream and upstream speeds into the equations:

s + c = 12
s - c = 8

Adding the two equations, we get:

2s = 20
s = 10

Now that we have the value of 's', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for 'c':

10 + c = 12
c = 2

Therefore, the speed of the sailor in still water is 10 km/h and the speed of the current is 2 km/h."

We can simplify the second equation to: <fact7>v1</fact7> + <fact8>v2</fact8> = <fact2>70 km</fact2>. 

Now we have two equations: <fact7>v1 * 7</fact7> + <fact8>v2 * 7</fact8> = <fact2>70 km</fact2> and <fact7>v1</fact7> + <fact8>v2</fact8> = <fact2>70 km</fact2>. 

We can multiply the second equation by 7 to get: <fact7>v1 * 7</fact7> + <fact8>v2 * 7</fact8> = <fact2>70 km * 7</fact2>. 

Since both equations are equal to <fact2>70 km</fact2>, we can set them equal to each other: <fact2>70 km * 7</fact2> = <fact2>70 km</fact2>. 

However, this is not true. The correct solution is to solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method. 

Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express <fact8>v2</fact8> as <fact8>v2</fact8> = <fact2>70 km</fact2> - <fact7>v1</fact7>. 

Substituting this expression into the first equation, we get: <fact7>v1 * 7</fact7> + (<fact2>70 km</fact2> - <fact7>v1</fact7>) * 7 = <fact2>70 km</fact2>. 

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: <fact7>v1 * 7</fact7> + <fact2>490 km</fact2> - <fact7>v1</fact7> * 7 = <fact2>70 km</fact2>. 

Combine like terms: <fact7>v1</fact7> * 7 - <fact7>v1</fact7> * 7 = <fact2>70 km</fact2> - <fact2>490 km</fact2>. 

The equation simplifies to: 0 = -420 km. 

This is not true. The correct solution is to solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method. 

Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by -7 to get: <fact7>v1 * 7</fact7> + <fact8>v2 * 7</fact8> = <fact2>70 km</fact2> and -<fact7>v1</fact7> * "
1430,"Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.","Reformatted Question: Amy travelled <fact1>300 km by train</fact1> and <fact2>200 km by taxi</fact2>, it took him <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3>. But if he travels <fact4>260 km by train</fact4> and <fact5>240 km by taxi</fact5> he takes <fact6>6 minutes longer</fact6>. Find the speed of <fact7>train</fact7> and <fact8>taxi</fact8>.

Answer: We are given two scenarios. In the first scenario, Amy travelled <fact1>300 km by train</fact1> and <fact2>200 km by taxi</fact2> in <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3>. Let's denote the speed of the train as <fact9>s1</fact9> and the speed of the taxi as <fact10>s2</fact10>. Then we can write the following equation based on the formula distance = speed × time:

<fact1>300</fact1> = <fact9>s1</fact9> × <fact11>5.5</fact11>  ... (1)
<fact2>200</fact2> = <fact10>s2</fact10> × <fact11>5.5</fact11>  ... (2)

In the second scenario, Amy travelled <fact4>260 km by train</fact4> and <fact5>240 km by taxi</fact5> in <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes + 6 minutes</fact3> = <fact12>5.6 hours</fact12>. We can write the following equations:

<fact4>260</fact4> = <fact9>s1</fact9> × <fact12>5.6</fact12>  ... (3)
<fact5>240</fact5> = <fact10>s2</fact10> × <fact12>5.6</fact12>  ... (4)

We can simplify equations (1) and (2) by dividing both sides by <fact11>5.5</fact11>:

<fact9>s1</fact9> = <fact1>300</fact1> ÷ <fact11>5.5</fact11> = <fact13>54.55</fact13>  ... (5)
<fact10>s2</fact10> = <fact2>200</fact2> ÷ <fact11>5.5</fact11> = <fact14>36.36</fact14>  ... (6)

We can simplify equations (3) and (4) by dividing both sides by <fact12>5.6</fact12>:

<fact9>s1</fact9> = <fact4>260</fact4> ÷ <fact12>5.6</fact12> = <fact13>46.43</fact13>  ... (7)
<fact10>s2</fact10> = <fact5>240</fact5> ÷ <fact12>5.6</fact12> = <fact14>42.86</fact14>  ... (8)

We can see that the speed of the train in scenario 1 and scenario 2 are not the same, and the speed of the taxi in scenario 1 and scenario 2 are also not the same. This is because the time taken to travel the same distance is different in the two scenarios.

However, we can find the average speed of the train and the taxi in each scenario. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.

In scenario 1, the total distance is <fact1>300 km</fact1> + <fact2>200 km</fact2> = <fact15>500 km</fact15>, and the total time is <fact3>5.5 hours</fact3>. The average speed of the train is <fact1>500 km</fact1> ÷ <fact3>5.5 hours</fact3> = <fact16>90.91 km/h</fact16>, and the average speed of the taxi is <fact2>500 km</fact2> ÷ <fact3>5.5 hours</fact3> = <fact17>90.91 km/h</fact17>.

In scenario 2, the total distance is <fact4>260 km</fact4> + <fact5>240 km</fact5> = <fact18>500 km</fact18>, and the total time is <fact3>5.6 hours</fact3>. The average speed of the train is <fact4>500 km</fact4> ÷ <fact3>5.6 hours</fact3> = <fact19>89.29 km/h</"
1431,"A man travels 600 km partly by train and partly by car. If he covers 400 km by train and the rest by car, it takes him 6 hours and 30 minutes. But if he travels 200 km by train and rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and that of car.","Reformatted Question: A man travels <fact1>600 km</fact1> partly by <fact2>train</fact2> and partly by <fact3>car</fact3>. If he covers <fact4>400 km</fact4> by <fact2>train</fact2> and the rest by <fact3>car</fact3>, it takes him <fact5>6 hours and 30 minutes</fact5>. But if he travels <fact6>200 km</fact6> by <fact2>train</fact2> and rest by <fact3>car</fact3>, he takes <fact7>30 minutes longer</fact7>. Find the speed of <fact2>train</fact2> and that of <fact3>car</fact3>.

Answer: Let's denote the speed of the train as <fact2>v_t</fact2> and the speed of the car as <fact3>v_c</fact3>. 

We can form two equations based on the given information. 

The time taken to travel 400 km by train and the rest by car is 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is <fact8>6.5 hours</fact8>. The distance covered by the car is <fact9>600 - 400 = 200 km</fact9>. The time taken to cover this distance is given by <fact10>time = distance/speed</fact10>. So, we have:

<fact11>200/v_c = 6.5 - 400/v_t</fact11>

The time taken to travel 200 km by train and the rest by car is 30 minutes longer, which is <fact12>6.5 + 0.5 = 7 hours</fact12>. The distance covered by the car is still <fact9>200 km</fact9>. The time taken to cover this distance is given by <fact10>time = distance/speed</fact10>. So, we have:

<fact13>200/v_c = 7 - 200/v_t</fact13>

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of <fact2>v_t</fact2> and <fact3>v_c</fact3>. 

First, let's simplify the equations by multiplying both sides by <fact14>v_c</fact14> to eliminate the fraction:

<fact15>200 = 6.5v_c - 400v_t/v_c</fact15>

<fact16>200 = 7v_c - 200v_t/v_c</fact16>

Now, let's multiply both sides of the second equation by <fact17>v_c</fact17> to eliminate the fraction:

<fact18>200v_c = 7v_c^2 - 200v_t</fact18>

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of <fact2>v_t</fact2> and <fact3>v_c</fact3>. 

Let's multiply the first equation by <fact19>200</fact19> to get:

<fact20>40000 = 1300v_c - 80000v_t/v_c</fact20>

Now, let's multiply the second equation by <fact21>200</fact21> to get:

<fact22>40000 = 1400v_c - 40000v_t/v_c</fact22>

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of <fact2>v_t</fact2> and <fact3>v_c</fact3>. 

Let's multiply both sides of the first equation by <fact23>v_c</fact23> to eliminate the fraction:

<fact24>40000v_c = 1300v_c^2 - 80000v_t</fact24>

Let's multiply both sides of the second equation by <fact25>v_c</fact25> to eliminate the fraction:

<fact26>40000v_c = 1400v_c^2 - 40000v_t</fact26>

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of <fact2>v_t</fact2> and <fact3>v_c</fact3>. 

Let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate <fact27>v_c</fact27>:

<fact28>0 = -100v_c^2 + 20000v_t</fact28>

Now we have one equation and one variable. We can solve for <fact29>v_t</fact29>:

<fact30>v_t = 100v_c^2 / 20000</fact30>

<fact31>v_t = v_c^2 / 200</fact31>

Now we have an equation for <fact32>v_t</fact32> in terms of <fact33>v_c"
1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","Reformatted Question: The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered.

What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of <fact5>25 km</fact5>?

Answer: For a journey of <fact1>10 km</fact1>, the charge paid is <fact2>$75</fact2>. This means the fixed charge is <fact2>$75</fact2> - <fact1>10 km</fact1> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6>. Since for a journey of <fact3>15 km</fact3>, the charge paid is <fact4>$110</fact4>, we can also say that the fixed charge is <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact3>15 km</fact3> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6>. We can equate the two expressions for the fixed charge and solve for <fact6>charge per km</fact6>. We get <fact2>$75</fact2> - <fact1>10 km</fact1> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6> = <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact3>15 km</fact3> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6>.

Factoring out <fact6>charge per km</fact6> from the left-hand side, we get - <fact1>10 km</fact1> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6> + <fact3>15 km</fact3> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6> = <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact2>$75</fact2>. Cancelling out <fact6>charge per km</fact6> from the left-hand side, we get - <fact1>10 km</fact1> + <fact3>15 km</fact3> = <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact2>$75</fact2>. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get <fact3>5 km</fact3> = <fact4>$35</fact4>. Dividing both sides by <fact3>5 km</fact3>, we get <fact6>charge per km</fact6> = <fact4>$35</fact4> / <fact3>5 km</fact3> = <fact7>$7 per km</fact7>. Now that we know the charge per km, we can find the charge for a journey of <fact5>25 km</fact5>. We get <fact5>25 km</fact5> * <fact7>$7 per km</fact7> = <fact8>$175</fact8>. Since the fixed charge is <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact3>15 km</fact3> * <fact6>charge per km</fact6>, we can substitute <fact6>charge per km</fact6> = <fact7>$7 per km</fact7> and <fact3>15 km</fact3> to get <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact3>15 km</fact3> * <fact7>$7 per km</fact7> = <fact4>$110</fact4> - <fact3>105</fact3> = <fact9>$5</fact9>. Adding the charge for the distance covered, <fact8>$175</fact8>, to the fixed charge, <fact9>$5</fact9>, we get <fact8>$175</fact8> + <fact9>$5</fact9> = <fact10>$180</fact10>."
1433,A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Reformatted Question: A railway <fact1>half ticket</fact1> costs <fact2>half the full fare</fact2> and the <fact3>reservation charge</fact3> is the same on <fact1>half ticket</fact1> as on <fact4>full ticket</fact4>. One reserved first class from <fact5>Michigan to Massachusetts</fact5> costs <fact6>$216</fact6> and one <fact7>full and one half</fact7> reserved first class tickets cost <fact8>$327</fact8>. What is the <fact9>basic first class full fare</fact9> and what is the <fact10>reservation charge</fact10>?

Answer: Let's denote the <fact9>basic first class full fare</fact9> as F and the <fact10>reservation charge</fact10> as R. According to the question, a <fact1>half ticket</fact1> costs <fact2>half the full fare</fact2>, so the cost of a half ticket is F/2. The total cost of a <fact7>full and one half</fact7> reserved first class tickets is the sum of the cost of a full ticket and the cost of a half ticket, which is F + F/2. We are given that the total cost of a <fact7>full and one half</fact7> reserved first class tickets is <fact8>$327</fact8>, so we can write the equation F + F/2 = 327. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2, which gives us 2F + F = 654. Combining like terms, we get 3F = 654. To solve for F, we divide both sides by 3, which gives us F = 654/3 = 218. Therefore, the <fact9>basic first class full fare</fact9> is <fact11>$218</fact11>. 

Now that we have found the <fact9>basic first class full fare</fact9>, we can find the <fact10>reservation charge</fact10>. We are given that the cost of a reserved first class ticket from <fact5>Michigan to Massachusetts</fact5> is <fact6>$216</fact6>, and we have found that the <fact9>basic first class full fare</fact9> is <fact11>$218</fact11>. Therefore, the <fact10>reservation charge</fact10> is the difference between the cost of a reserved first class ticket and the <fact9>basic first class full fare</fact9>, which is 216 - 218 = -2. However, this is not possible, as the <fact10>reservation charge</fact10> cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-examine our equation. 

We are given that a <fact1>half ticket</fact1> costs <fact2>half the full fare</fact2>, so the cost of a half ticket is F/2. We are also given that the <fact3>reservation charge</fact3> is the same on <fact1>half ticket</fact1> as on <fact4>full ticket</fact4>, so the cost of a half ticket is F + R. We can set up an equation using this information: F/2 = F + R. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2, which gives us F = 2F + 2R. Subtracting F from both sides, we get 0 = F + 2R. Subtracting 2R from both sides, we get -2R = F. 

We are given that the total cost of a <fact7>full and one half</fact7> reserved first class tickets is <fact8>$327</fact8>, so we can write the equation F + F/2 = 327. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2, which gives us 2F + F = 654. Combining like terms, we get 3F = 654. To solve for F, we both sides by 3, which gives us F = 654/3 = 218. However, we have also found that F = -2R. Therefore, we can substitute F = -2R into the equation F = 218, which gives us -2R = 218. Dividing both sides by -2, we get R = -109. However, this is not possible, as the <fact10>reservation charge</fact10> cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-examine our equation again.

1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Reformatted Question: A man walks <fact1>certain distance</fact1> with <fact2>certain speed</fact2>. If he walks <fact3>1/2 km/hr faster</fact3>, he takes <fact4>1 hr less</fact4>. But if he walks <fact5>1 km/hr slower</fact5>, he takes <fact6>3 more hours</fact6>. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.

Answer: Let's denote the distance covered by the man as <fact1>d</fact1> and his original rate of walking as <fact2>v</fact2>. 

According to the problem, if the man walks <fact3>1/2 km/hr faster</fact3>, he takes <fact4>1 hr less</fact4>. This means that the time taken to cover the distance is reduced by 1 hour. The new time taken to cover the distance is <fact7>t - 1</fact7>, where <fact7>t</fact7> is the original time taken. The new rate of walking is <fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>. We can write the equation:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>) * (<fact7>t - 1</fact7>)

According to the problem, if the man walks <fact5>1 km/hr slower</fact5>, he takes <fact6>3 more hours</fact6>. This means that the time taken to cover the distance is increased by 3 hours. The new time taken to cover the distance is <fact7>t + 3</fact7>. The new rate of walking is <fact2>v - 1</fact2>. We can write the equation:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v - 1</fact2>) * (<fact7>t + 3</fact7>)

We can equate the two expressions for <fact1>d</fact1>:

(<fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>) * (<fact7>t - 1</fact7>) = (<fact2>v - 1</fact2>) * (<fact7>t + 3</fact7>)

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

vt - v + 1/2t - 1/2 = vt - v + 3t + 3

Combine like terms:

1/2t - 1/2 = 3t + 3

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:

t - 1 = 6t + 6

Subtract t from both sides:

-1 = 5t + 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:

-7 = 5t

Divide both sides by 5:

-7/5 = t

Now that we have the value of t, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for v. Let's use the first equation:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>) * (<fact7>t - 1</fact7>)

Substitute t = -7/5:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>) * (-7/5 - 1)

Simplify the right-hand side:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>) * (-12/5)

Now, substitute t = -7/5 into the second equation:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v - 1</fact2>) * (<fact7>t + 3</fact7>)

Substitute t = -7/5:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v - 1</fact2>) * (-7/5 + 3)

Simplify the right-hand side:

<fact1>d</fact1> = (<fact2>v - 1</fact2>) * (8/5)

Now, equate the two expressions for <fact1>d</fact1>:

(<fact2>v + 1/2</fact2>) * (-12/5) = (<fact2>v - 1</fact2>) * (8/5)

Expand and simplify the equation:

-12v/5 - 12/5 = 8v/5 - 8/5

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fractions:

-12v - 12 = 8v - 8

Add 12v to both sides:

0 = 20v - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

8 = 20v

Divide both sides by 20:

8/20 = v

v = 2/5

1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"Reformatted Question: A car goes <fact1>uphill</fact1> at the rate of <fact2>30 km an hour</fact2> and <fact3>downhill</fact3> at the rate of <fact4>50 km an hour</fact4> after <fact5>15 hours</fact5> it has covered <fact6>650 km</fact6>. How long did it go <fact3>downhill</fact3> and <fact1>uphill</fact1> respectively?

Answer: Let's denote the time the car went uphill as x hours and the time the car went downhill as y hours. We know that the car went for a total of 15 hours, so we have the equation x + y = 15. We also know that the car's speed uphill is 30 km/h and its speed downhill is 50 km/h. The distance traveled uphill is 30x and the distance traveled downhill is 50y. We are given that the total distance traveled is 650 km, so we have the equation 30x + 50y = 650. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.

First, let's solve the equation x + y = 15 for x:
x = 15 - y

Now, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:
30(15 - y) + 50y = 650

Expand and simplify the equation:
450 - 30y + 50y = 650

Combine like terms:
20y = 200

Divide both sides by 20:
y = 10

Now that we have found y, we can find x by substituting y into the equation x + y = 15:
x + 10 = 15

Subtract 10 from both sides:
x = 5

Therefore, the car went uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours."
1436,"Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","Reformatted Question: Ronnie travels <fact1>300 km</fact1> to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes <fact2>4 hours</fact2> if she travels <fact3>60 km</fact3> by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels <fact4>100 km</fact4> by train and the remaining by bus, she takes <fact5>10 minutes longer</fact5>. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.

Answer: Let's denote the speed of the train as T km/h and the speed of the bus as B km/h. 

From the first scenario, Ronnie travels 60 km by train and the remaining 240 km by bus in 4 hours. The time taken to travel 60 km by train is 60/T hours. The time taken to travel 240 km by bus is 240/B hours. We know that the total time taken is 4 hours, so we can write the equation:

60/T + 240/B = 4 ... (Equation 1)

From the second scenario, Ronnie travels 100 km by train and the remaining 200 km by bus in 4 hours and 10 minutes. The time taken to travel 100 km by train is 100/T hours. The time taken to travel 200 km by bus is 200/B hours. We know that the total time taken is 4 hours and 10 minutes, which is equal to 4.1667 hours. So, we can write the equation:

100/T + 200/B = 4.1667 ... (Equation 2)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of T and B.

First, let's multiply Equation 1 by 100 and Equation 2 by 60 to make the coefficients of T and B the same:

6000/T + 24000/B = 400 ... (Equation 3)
6000/T + 12000/B = 250.0000 ... (Equation 4)

Now, let's subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate T:

12000/B = 150

Now, let's divide both sides by 12000:

B = 150/12000
B = 0.0125

Now that we have the value of B, let's substitute it into Equation 1:

60/T + 240/0.0125 = 4

Now, let's simplify the equation:

60/T + 19200 = 4

Now, let's subtract 19200 from both sides:

60/T = -19196

Now, let's multiply both sides by T:

60 = -19196T

Now, let's divide both sides by -19196:

T = -60/19196
T = -0.003125

Since speed cannot be negative, we will take the absolute value of T:

T = 0.003125

Now, let's convert the speeds to km/h:

T = 3.125 km/h
B = 12.5 km/h"
1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","Reformatted Question: A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been <fact1>6 km/hr faster</fact1> it would have <fact2>8 hours less</fact2> than the scheduled time, and if the train were <fact3>slower by 6 km/hr</fact3>, it would have taken <fact4>12 hours more</fact4> than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.

Answer: Let's denote the original speed of the train as <fact1>s</fact1> and the original time taken as <fact2>t</fact2>. The distance covered is the same in all cases, so we can denote it as <fact3>d</fact3>. 

According to the given information, if the train would have been <fact1>6 km/hr faster</fact1>, it would have taken <fact2>t - 8</fact2> hours. We can express this as:

<fact3>d</fact3> = <fact1>s + 6</fact1> * (<fact2>t - 8</fact2>)

According to the given information, if the train were <fact3>slower by 6 km/hr</fact3>, it would have taken <fact4>t + 12</fact4> hours. We can express this as:

<fact3>d</fact3> = <fact1>s - 6</fact1> * (<fact4>t + 12</fact4>)

We can equate the two expressions for <fact3>d</fact3> and simplify:

<fact1>s + 6</fact1> * (<fact2>t - 8</fact2>) = <fact1>s - 6</fact1> * (<fact4>t + 12</fact4>)

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

<fact1>s</fact1>t + 6t - 48 = <fact1>s</fact1>t - 6t - 72

Combine like terms:

12t - 48 = - 72

Add 48 to both sides:

12t = -24

Divide both sides by 12:

t = -2

However, time cannot be negative. This means that the original time <fact2>t</fact2> must be 2 hours more than the scheduled time. This means that the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr is 2 hours more than the scheduled time, which is <fact4>12 hours more</fact4> than the scheduled time. 

Since the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr is 2 hours more than the scheduled time, we can express the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr as <fact4>t + 2</fact4>. 

We can equate the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr to <fact4>t + 12</fact4>:

<fact4>t + 2</fact4> = <fact4>t + 12</fact4>

Subtract <fact4>t</fact4> from both sides:

2 = 12

This is a contradiction. This means that the original time <fact2>t</fact2> cannot be 2 hours more than the scheduled time.

However, we can see that the original time <fact2>t</fact2> must be 2 hours less than the scheduled time. This means that the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr is 2 hours more than the scheduled time, which is <fact4>12 hours more</fact4> than the scheduled time. 

Since the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr is 2 hours more than the scheduled time, we can express the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr as <fact4>t + 2</fact4>. 

We can equate the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr to <fact4>t + 12</fact4>:

<fact4>t + 2</fact4> = <fact4>t + 12</fact4>

Subtract <fact4>t</fact4> from both sides:

2 = 12

Subtract 12 from both sides:

 = 0

This means that the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr is the scheduled time. 

Since the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr is the scheduled time, we can express the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr as <fact4>t</fact4>. 

We can equate the time taken if the train were slower by 6 km/hr to <fact4>t</fact4>:

<fact4>t</fact4> = <fact4>t</fact4>

1439,"The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.","Reformatted Question: The coach of a cricket team buys <fact1>7 bats</fact1> and <fact2>6 balls</fact2> for <fact3>$3800</fact3>. Later, he buys <fact4>3 bats</fact4> and <fact5>5 balls</fact5> for <fact6>$1750</fact6>. Find the cost of each <fact7>bat</fact7> and each <fact8>ball</fact8>.

Answer: Let's denote the cost of each bat as B and the cost of each ball as L. From the information given, we can create two equations based on the two purchases:

1) 7B + 6L = 3800
2) 3B + 5L = 1750

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in this case. First, we can multiply equation (2) by 7 and equation (1) by 3 to make the coefficients of B in both equations equal:

1) 21B + 18L = 11400
2) 21B + 35L = 12250

Now, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate B:

(21B + 35L) - (21B + 18L) = 12250 - 11400
17L = 850

Now, we can solve for L:

L = 850 / 17
L = 50

Now that we have the cost of each ball (L = 50), we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for B. Let's use equation (1):

7B + 6(50) = 3800
7B + 300 = 3800

Now, we can solve for B:

7B = 3800
B = 0 / 7
B = 0 / 7

B = 0 / 7"
1441,"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.","Reformatted Question: The sum of the digits of a <fact1>two-digit number</fact1> is <fact2>9</fact2>. Also, nine times this number is <fact3>twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits</fact3>. Find the number.
Answer: Let's denote the two-digit number as <fact1>10a + b</fact1>, where <fact2>a</fact2> is the tens digit and <fact3>b</fact3> is the ones digit. According to the problem, the sum of the digits is <fact2>9</fact2>, so we have <fact1>a + b = 9</fact1>. 

The number obtained by reversing the order of the digits is <fact1>10b + a</fact1>. According to the problem, nine times the original number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits, so we have <fact1>9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a)</fact1>. 

We can simplify the equation <fact1>9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a)</fact1> to <fact1>90a + 9b = 20b + 2a</fact1>. Rearranging the terms, we get <fact1>88a - 11b = 0</fact1>. 

We can solve the system of equations <fact1>a + b = 9</fact1> and <fact1>88a - 11b = 0</fact1> to find the values of <fact2>a</fact2> and <fact3>b</fact3>. Multiplying the first equation by <fact2>11</fact2>, we get <fact1>11a + 11b = 99</fact1>. Adding this equation to the second equation, we get <fact1>99a = 99</fact1>, so <fact2>a = 1</fact2>. 

Substituting <fact2>a = 1</fact2> into the first equation, we get <fact1>1 + b = 9</fact1>, so <fact3>b = 8</fact3>. Therefore, the two-digit number is <fact1>10a + b = 10(1) + 8 = 18</fact1>."

He received an annual interest of <fact3>$130</fact3>. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received <fact4>$4 more</fact4>. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?

Answer: Let's denote the amount invested at 12% as x and the amount invested at 10% as y. The interest from the 12% investment is 0.12x and the interest from the 10% investment is 0.10y. The total interest is $130, so we have the equation 0.12x + 0.10y = 130 (equation 1). If he had interchanged the investments, the interest from the 12% investment would be 0.10x and the interest from the 10% investment would be 0.12y. The total interest would be $134, so we have the equation 0.10x + 0.12y = 134 (equation 2). We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get 0.02x = 4, so x = 200. Substituting x = 200 into equation 1, we get 0.12(200) + 0.10y = 130, which simplifies to 24 + 0.10y = 130. Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get 0.10y = 106, so y = 1060. Therefore, the person invested $200 at 12% and $1060 at 10%."
1445,At present a father is three times as old as his son. After 12 years his age will be twice the age of his son. Find their present ages?,"Reformatted Question: At present, a father is <fact1>three times as old as his son</fact1>. After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, his age will be <fact3>twice the age of his son</fact3>. Find their present ages?

Let's denote the present age of the son as S and the present age of the father as F.

According to the given information, at present, the father is three times as old as his son. This can be written as:
F = 3S (equation 1)

After 12 years, the age of the father will be F + 12 and the age of the son will be S + 12. According to the given information, after 12 years, the age of the father will be twice the age of his son. This can be written as:
F + 12 = 2(S + 12) (equation 2)

Now, we can solve these two equations to find the present ages of the father and the son.

First, let's simplify equation 2:
F + 12 = 2S + 24
F - 2S = 12 (equation 3)

Now, we can substitute the value of F from equation 1 into equation 3:
3S - 2S = 12
S = 12 (equation 4)

Now that we know the present age of the son, we can find the present age of the father using equation 1:
F = 3S
F = 3(12)
F = 36

Therefore, the present age of the son is 12 years and the present age of the father is 36 years.

Answer: Let's call the smaller angle <fact1>x</fact1> and the larger angle <fact2>x + 18</fact2>. Since they are supplementary angles, their sum is <fact3>180 degrees</fact3>. We can write an equation to represent this: <fact1>x</fact1> + (<fact2>x + 18</fact2>) = <fact3>180</fact3>. Simplifying the equation, we get <fact1>2x</fact1> + 18 = <fact3>180</fact3>. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get <fact1>2x</fact1> = <fact4>162</fact4>. Dividing both sides by 2, we get <fact1>x</fact1> = <fact5>81</fact5>.

If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.","Reformatted Question: The area of a rectangle gets reduced by <fact1>9 square units</fact1>, if its length is reduced by <fact2>5 units</fact2> and breadth is increased by <fact3>3 units</fact3>. If we increase the length by <fact4>3 units</fact4> and the breadth by <fact5>2 units</fact5>, the area increases by <fact6>67 square units</fact6>. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

Answer: Let's denote the original length and breadth of the rectangle as L and B respectively. The area of the rectangle is given by A = L * B.

According to the first statement, the area gets reduced by 9 square units when the length is reduced by 5 units and the breadth is increased by 3 units. This can be expressed as (L - 5) * (B + 3) = A - 9.

The second statement says that the area increases by 67 square units when the length is increased by 3 units and the breadth is increased by 2 units. This can be expressed as (L + 3) * (B + 2) = A + 67.

Now, we have two equations:

(L - 5) * (B + 3) = A - 9
(L + 3) * (B + 2) = A + 67

We can simplify these equations by expanding the products:

LB + 3L - 5B - 15 = A - 9
LB + 3L + 2B + 6 = A + 67

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

8B + 21 = 76

Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get:

8B = 55

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

B = 6.875

Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of L. Let's use the first equation:

(L - 5) * (B + 3) = A - 9

Substituting B = 6.875, we get:

(L - 5) * (6.875 + 3) = A - 9

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(L - 5) * 9.875 = A - 9

We know that A = LB, so we can substitute this expression for A:

(L - 5) * 9.875 = LB - 9

Substituting B = 6.875, we get:

(L - 5) * 9.875 = L * 6.875 - 9

Expanding the products, we get:

9.875L - 49.125 = 58.125 - 9

Combine like terms:

9.875L - 49.125 = 49.125

Add 49.125 to both sides:

9.875L = 98.25

Divide both sides by 9.875:

L = 10

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are L = 10 units and B = 6.875 units."
1452,"In a 2-digit number, the tens digit is 4 times the units digit. When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. Find the original number.","Reformatted Question: In a <fact1>2-digit number</fact1>, the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> is <fact3>4 times the units digit</fact3>. When the <fact4>digits are reversed</fact4>, the new number formed is <fact5>54 less</fact5> than the <fact6>original number</fact6>. Find the <fact7>original number</fact7>.

Answer: Let's denote the units digit as x. Since the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, the tens digit is 4x. The original number is then 10(4x) + x = 40x + x = 41x. When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10x + 4x = 14x. According to the problem, the new number is 54 less than the original number, so we can set up the equation 41x - 14x = 54. Simplifying the equation, we get 27x = 54. Dividing both sides by 27, we get x = 2. Since x is the units digit, the original number is 41x = 41(2) = 82. The answer is {82}."

Find their present ages.
Answer: Let's denote Anil's present age as A and Ajith's present age as J. From <fact1>9 years older than Ajith</fact1>, we have A = J + 9. 
In <fact2>10 years</fact2>, Anil will be A + 10, and Ajith was 10 years ago, J - 10. From <fact3>twice as old as Ajith was 10 years ago</fact3>, we have A + 10 = 2 * (J - 10). 
Now we have two equations: A = J + 9 and A + 10 = 2 * (J - 10). We can substitute A from the first equation into the second equation: J + 9 + 10 = 2 * (J - 10). 
Simplifying the equation, we get J + 19 = 2J - 20. Subtracting J from both sides, we get 19 = J - 20. Adding 20 to both sides, we get 39 = J. 
Now that we have J, we can find A using the first equation: A = J + 9 = 39 + 9 = 48. So, Anil is 48 years old and Ajith is 39 years old. The answer is {Anil: 48, Ajith: 39}."

Answer: Let's denote the certain number as x. According to the question, <fact1>28 less than five times a certain number</fact1> is <fact2>232</fact2>. This can be translated into the equation 5x - 28 = 232. To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we add 28 to both sides of the equation, which gives us 5x = 232 + 28. This simplifies to 5x = 260. Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us x = 260 / 5. This simplifies to x = 52. The answer is {52}."

Answer: Let's denote the first angle as A. According to the problem, the second angle is double the first, so the second angle is 2A. The third angle is 40 less than the first, so the third angle is A - 40. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: A + 2A + (A - 40) = 180. Combining like terms, we get 4A - 40 = 180. Adding 40 to both sides, we get 4A = 220. Dividing both sides by 4, we get A = 55. Now that we have the value of A, we can find the other two angles. The second angle is 2A, which is 2 * 55 = 110. The third angle is A - 40, which is 55 - 40 = 15. Therefore, the three angles are 55, 110, and 15. The answer is {55, 110, 15}."

Answer: Let's denote the cost of the love seat as x. Since the sofa costs double the love seat, the cost of the sofa is 2x. The total cost of both the sofa and the love seat is $444, so we can set up the equation x + 2x = $444. Combining like terms, we get 3x = $444. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3, which gives us x = $148. Since the love seat costs $148, the sofa costs double that, which is $148 * 2 = $296. The answer is {148, 296}."
1459,"A horse and a saddle cost 5000 dollars. If the horse cost 4 times as much as the saddle, what was the cost of each?","Reformatted Question: A horse and a saddle cost <fact1>$5000</fact1>. If the horse cost <fact2>4 times as much as the saddle</fact2>, what was the cost of each?
Answer: Let's denote the cost of the saddle as <fact3>S</fact3>. According to the information, the horse cost <fact2>4 times as much as the saddle</fact2>, so the cost of the horse is <fact3>4S</fact3>. We know that the total cost of the horse and the saddle is <fact1>$5000</fact1>, so we can write the equation: <fact3>S</fact3> + <fact3>4S</fact3> = <fact1>$5000</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the cost of the helmet as <fact3>x</fact3>. Since the bicycle cost <fact2>5 times as much as the helmet</fact2>, the cost of the bicycle is <fact3>5x</fact3>. The total cost of both items is <fact1>$240</fact1>, so we can write the equation: <fact3>x</fact3> + <fact3>5x</fact3> = <fact1>$240</fact1>. Combining like terms, we get <fact3>6x</fact3> = <fact1>$240</fact1>.

Answer: We know that there are <fact1>45 students</fact1> in total. Let's use a variable to represent the number of boys. If we let <fact3>b</fact3> be the number of boys, then the number of girls is <fact2>twice as many</fact2>, which means it is <fact3>2b</fact3>.

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"Reformatted Question: Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is <fact1>12 degrees smaller</fact1> than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.

Answer: Since two angles of the triangle are the same size, let's call this size <fact2>x</fact2>. The third angle is <fact1>12 degrees smaller</fact1> than the first angle, so it is <fact2>x - 12</fact2> degrees. According to the triangle angle sum theorem, the sum of the three angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: <fact2>x</fact2> + <fact2>x</fact2> + (<fact2>x - 12</fact2>) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x - 12 = 180. Adding 12 to both sides of the equation, we get: 3x = 192. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get: x = 64. So, the two equal angles are 64 degrees each, and the third angle is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees. The answer is {64, 64, 52}."
1469,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 3 times as large as the first. How large are the angles?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>two angles</fact1> of a triangle that are the same size. The third angle is <fact2>3 times as large</fact2> as the first. How large are the angles?

Answer: We are given that there are <fact1>two angles</fact1> of a triangle that are the same size. Let's call the size of these two angles <fact3>x</fact3>. Since the third angle is <fact2>3 times as large</fact2> as the first, the size of the third angle is <fact3>3x</fact3>. 

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is <fact4>180 degrees</fact4>. Since we have three angles, we can write an equation to represent this: <fact1>2x + 3x = 180</fact1>. 

Simplifying the equation, we get <fact5>5x = 180</fact5>. To solve for <fact3>x</fact3>, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: <fact6>x = 180/5</fact6>. 

Simplifying further, we get <fact7>x = 36</fact7>. Now that we know the value of <fact3>x</fact3>, we can find the size of the other two angles. Since the two angles are the same size, each angle is <fact8>36 degrees</fact8>. The third angle is <fact2>3 times as large</fact2> as the first, so its size is <fact9>3 * 36 = 108 degrees</fact9>. 

Therefore, the sizes of the angles are <fact10>36 degrees</fact10>, <fact11>36 degrees</fact11>, and <fact12>108 degrees</fact12>."
1470,The third angle of a triangle is the same size as the first. The second angle is 4 times the third. Find the measure of the angles.,"Reformatted Question: The third angle of a triangle is the same size as the first. The second angle is 4 times the third. Find the measure of the angles.

Answer: Let's denote the measure of the first angle as x. Since the third angle is the same size as the first, the measure of the third angle is also x. The second angle is 4 times the third, so the measure of the second angle is 4x. We know that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x + 4x = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = 180. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 30. So, the measure of the first angle is 30 degrees, the measure of the second angle is 4x = 4(30) = 120 degrees, and the measure of the third angle is also 30 degrees. The answer is {30, 120, 30}."
1471,The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?,"Reformatted Question: The second angle of a triangle is <fact1>five times as large as the first</fact1>. The measure of the third angle is <fact2>12 degrees greater than that of the first angle</fact2>. How large are the angles?

Answer: Let's call the measure of the first angle <fact1>x</fact1>. According to the question, the measure of the second angle is <fact1>five times as large as the first</fact1>, so it is 5x. The measure of the third angle is <fact2>12 degrees greater than that of the first angle</fact2>, so it is x + 12.

Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can write the following equation:

x + 5x + (x + 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 180

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 24

Now that we know the measure of the first angle is 24 degrees, we can find the measures of the other two angles:

The second angle is 5x = 5(24) = 120 degrees.

The third angle is x + 12 = 24 + 12 = 36 degrees.

Therefore, the angles are 24, 120, and 36 degrees."
1472,"The second angle of a triangle is three times the first, and the third is 12 degrees less than twice the first. Find the measures of the angles.","Reformatted Question: The second angle of a triangle is <fact1>three times the first</fact1>, and the third is <fact2>12 degrees less than twice the first</fact2>. Find the measures of the angles.
Answer: Let's denote the first angle as x. According to the problem, the second angle is three times the first, so it is 3x. The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first, so it is 2x - 12. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x - 12 = 180. Adding 12 to both sides, we get 6x = 192. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 32. Now we can find the measures of the angles: the first angle is x = 32 degrees, the second angle is 3x = 3 * 32 = 96 degrees, and the third angle is 2x - 12 = 2 * 32 - 12 = 52 degrees. The answer is {32, 96, 52}."

Answer: The perimeter of a <fact1>rectangle</fact1> is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). We are given that the perimeter is <fact2>150 cm</fact2>, so we can write the equation as 150 = 2(length + width). 

We are also given that the length is <fact3>15 cm greater than the width</fact3>, so we can write the length as width + 15. Substituting this into the equation, we get 150 = 2((width + 15) + width). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 150 = 2(2width + 15). 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get 75 = 2width + 15. 

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get 60 = 2width. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get 30 = width. 

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by substituting the width into the equation length = width + 15. 

So, length = 30 + 15 = 45. 

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 30 cm by 45 cm."

What are the dimensions?,"Reformatted Question: The perimeter of a college basketball court is <fact1>96 meters</fact1> and the length is <fact2>14 meters more than the width</fact2>. What are the dimensions?
Answer: Let's denote the width as <fact3>w</fact3> and the length as <fact4>l</fact4>. We know that the length is 14 meters more than the width, so we can write <fact4>l</fact4> = <fact3>w</fact3> + 14. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w. We are given that the perimeter is 96 meters, so we can write 96 = 2l + 2w. Substituting <fact4>l</fact4> = <fact3>w</fact3> + 14 into the equation, we get 96 = 2(<fact3>w</fact3> + 14) + 2w. Simplifying the equation, we get 96 = 2w + 28 + 2w, which simplifies to 96 = 4w + 28. Subtracting 28 from both sides, we get 68 = 4w. Dividing both sides by 4, we get w = 17. Now that we know the width, we can find the length by substituting w = 17 into the equation <fact4>l</fact4> = <fact3>w</fact3> + 14. We get l = 17 + 14 = 31. Therefore, the dimensions are 17 meters by 31 meters. The answer is {17, 31}."

To find the side length, we take the square root of both sides, which gives us <fact2>side length</fact2> = √100 = 10 feet. Now that we know the side length, we can find the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. Therefore, the kitchen's perimeter is 4 * 10 = 40 feet."
1489,The length of a rectangular field is 75 meters. Its width is 15 meters. Sofie ran around the track 3 times. How far did she run?,"Reformatted Question: The length of a rectangular field is <fact1>75 meters</fact1>. Its width is <fact2>15 meters</fact2>. Sofie ran around the track <fact3>3 times</fact3>. How far did she run?

Answer: The field has a length of <fact1>75 meters</fact1> and a width of <fact2>15 meters</fact2>. To find the perimeter of the field, we need to add the lengths of all its sides. The perimeter is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width). In this case, the perimeter is 2 * (75 + 15) = 2 * 90 = 180 meters. Since Sofie ran around the track <fact3>3 times</fact3>, the total distance she ran is 3 times the perimeter of the field, which is 3 * 180 = 540 meters. The answer is {540}."
1491,The area of square photo is 25 square inches. Angie decided to enlarge the photo by doubling the sides. What will the new area be?,"Reformatted Question: The area of <fact1>square photo</fact1> is <fact2>25 square inches</fact2>. Angie decided to enlarge the photo by <fact3>doubling the sides</fact3>. What will the new area be?

Answer: The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side. Since the area of the original square is <fact2>25 square inches</fact2>, we can find the length of its side by taking the square root of the area. So, the length of the side of the original square is √<fact2>25</fact2> = 5 inches. Now, Angie decided to enlarge the photo by <fact3>doubling the sides</fact3>, which means the new side length will be 2 * 5 = 10 inches. To find the new area, we square the new side length: 10^2 = 100 square inches. The answer is {100}."
1492,Bridget needs to make rectangular cards measuring 2 inches by 3 inches. She will cut them from a square sheet of poster board measuring 1 foot on each side. What is the greatest number of cards that Bridget can make?,"Reformatted Question: Bridget needs to make rectangular cards measuring <fact1>2 inches by 3 inches</fact1>. She will cut them from a square sheet of poster board measuring <fact2>1 foot on each side</fact2>. What is the greatest number of cards that Bridget can make?

Answer: To find the greatest number of cards that Bridget can make, we need to first find the area of the square sheet of poster board. Since the poster board is 1 foot on each side, we need to convert the units to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the poster board is 12 inches on each side. The area of the poster board is <fact2>12 inches</fact2> * <fact2>12 inches</fact2> = 144 square inches.

Next, we need to find the area of each card. The cards are 2 inches by 3 inches, so the area of each card is <fact1>2 inches</fact1> * <fact1>3 inches</fact1> = 6 square inches.

To find the greatest number of cards that Bridget can make, we need to divide the area of the poster board by the area of each card. This will give us the maximum number of cards that can fit in the poster board. The number of cards is 144 / 6 = 24 cards. The answer is {24}."

1497,The distance around a rectangular garden is 36 feet. One side measures 10 feet. What is the area of the garden?,"Reformatted Question: The distance around a rectangular garden is <fact1>36 feet</fact1>. One side measures <fact2>10 feet</fact2>. What is the area of the garden?
Answer: The area of a rectangular garden can be calculated by multiplying the length and width of the garden. The distance around the garden is given as <fact1>36 feet</fact1>, which is the perimeter of the garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the perimeter is <fact1>36 feet</fact1>, we can set up an equation: 2(length + width) = 36. We are also given that one side measures <fact2>10 feet</fact2>, which we can assume is the length. Substituting this value into the equation, we get: 2(10 + width) = 36. Simplifying the equation, we get: 20 + 2width = 36. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get: 2width = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: width = 8. Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the area by multiplying them: area = length * width = 10 * 8 = 80. The answer is {80}."
1498,Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures 6 feet by 10 feet. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are 6 inches. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures <fact1>6 feet</fact1> by <fact2>10 feet</fact2>. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are <fact3>6 inches</fact3>. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?

Answer: First, we need to find out the area of the bathroom. The area of a rectangle is length times width. The length of the bathroom is <fact1>6 feet</fact1> and the width is <fact2>10 feet</fact2>. So, the area of the bathroom is <fact1>6 feet</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 60 square feet. 

Now, we need to find out the area of one tile. The area of a square is side times side. The side of the tile is <fact3>6 inches</fact3>. We need to convert the side from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the side of the tile in feet is <fact3>6 inches</fact3> / 12 = 0.5 feet. The area of the tile is 0.5 feet * 0.5 feet = 0.25 square feet.

Now, we need to find out how many tiles Mrs. Garvey needs. To do this, we divide the area of the bathroom by the area of one tile. The area of the bathroom is 60 square feet and the area of one tile is 0.25 square feet. So, the number of tiles Mrs. Garvey needs is 60 / 0.25 = 240 tiles. The answer is {240}."
1499,Mr. Johnson used 80 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden. The length of the garden is 25 meters. How wide is the garden?,"Reformatted Question: Mr. Johnson used <fact1>80 meters</fact1> of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden. The length of the garden is <fact2>25 meters</fact2>. How wide is the garden?
Answer: A rectangular garden has four sides. To enclose the garden, Mr. Johnson used <fact1>80 meters</fact1> of fencing. This means the perimeter of the garden is <fact1>80 meters</fact1>. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. We are given that the length of the garden is <fact2>25 meters</fact2>. So, we can plug in the values into the formula: 80 = 2(25) + 2w. Simplifying the equation, we get 80 = 50 + 2w. Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get 30 = 2w. Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 15. Therefore, the width of the garden is 15 meters. The answer is {15}."
1500,A rectangle has an area of 360 square centimeters. It is 20 centimeters long. What is its perimeter?,"Reformatted Question: A rectangle has an area of <fact1>360 square centimeters</fact1>. It is <fact2>20 centimeters long</fact2>. What is its <fact3>perimeter</fact3>?
Answer: The area of a rectangle is given by <fact1>length * width</fact1>. Since we know the area is <fact1>360 square centimeters</fact1> and the length is <fact2>20 centimeters</fact2>, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length: <fact1>360</fact1> / <fact2>20</fact2> = 18 centimeters. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by <fact3>2 * (length + width)</fact3>. Plugging in the values, we get <fact3>2 * (20 + 18)</fact3> = 76 centimeters. The answer is {76}."
1501,A square garden has a perimeter of 48 meters. A pond inside the garden has an area of 20 square meters. What is the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond?,"Reformatted Question: A <fact1>square garden</fact1> has a <fact2>perimeter of 48 meters</fact2>. A <fact3>pond inside the garden</fact3> has an <fact4>area of 20 square meters</fact4>. What is the <fact5>area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond</fact5>?

Answer: To find the <fact5>area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond</fact5>, we need to find the <fact5>total area of the garden</fact5> first. Since the garden is <fact1>square</fact1>, we can find the <fact6>side length of the garden</fact6> using the <fact2>perimeter</fact2>. The <fact7>perimeter of a square</fact7> is given by the formula <fact8>4 * side length</fact8>. Since the <fact2>perimeter of the garden</fact2> is 48 meters, we can set up the equation <fact8>4 * side length = 48</fact8> and solve for the <fact6>side length</fact6>. 

Solving the equation <fact8>4 * side length = 48</fact8> for the <fact6>side length</fact6>, we get <fact8>side length = 48 / 4 = 12</fact8> meters. Now that we have the <fact6>side length</fact6> of the garden, we can find the <fact5>total area of the garden</fact5> using the formula <fact9>side length * side length</fact9> or <fact9>side length^2</fact9>. 

The <fact5>total area of the garden</fact5> is <fact9>12^2 = 144</fact9> square meters. Now that we have the <fact5>total area of the garden</fact5> and the <fact4>area of the pond</fact4>, we can find the <fact5>area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond</fact5> by subtracting the <fact4>area of the pond</fact4> from the <fact5>total area of the garden</fact5>. 

The <fact5>area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond</fact5> is <fact9>144 - 20 = 124</fact9> square meters. The answer is {124}."
1502,A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?,"Reformatted Question: A rectangular living room measures <fact1>12 feet</fact1> by <fact2>10 feet</fact2>. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border <fact3>2 feet wide</fact3> all around it. What is the area of the border?

Answer: To find the area of the border, we first need to find the area of the entire room and then subtract the area of the carpet from it. The area of the room is <fact1>12 feet</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 120 square feet. The carpet covers the entire room except for the border, which is <fact3>2 feet wide</fact3> all around it. So, the dimensions of the carpet are (12 - 2) * (10 - 2) = 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Now, we can find the area of the border by subtracting the area of the carpet from the area of the room: 120 - 80 = 40 square feet. The answer is {40}."
1503,A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?,"Reformatted Question: A square has <fact1>sides that measure 15 cm</fact1>. A rectangle has a <fact2>length of 18 cm</fact2>. The <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> is equal to the <fact4>perimeter of the rectangle</fact4>. What is the <fact5>area of the rectangle</fact5>?

Answer: The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of the square is <fact1>4 times the length of one side</fact1>, which is <fact1>4 * 15</fact1> = 60 cm. The perimeter of the rectangle is <fact2>2 times the length plus 2 times the width</fact2>. Since the perimeter is equal to the square, we have 2 * 18 + 2 * w = 60. Simplifying, we get 36 + 2w = 60. Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get 2w = 24. Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 12. Now that we know the width of the rectangle, we can find its area, which is <fact5>length times width</fact5>, so the area of the rectangle is 18 * 12 = 216. The answer is {216}."
1504,"Kevin can mow a square lawn that is 30 meters of each side in 45 minutes. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side?","Reformatted Question: Kevin can mow a square lawn that is <fact1>30 meters of each side</fact1> in <fact2>45 minutes</fact2>. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures <fact3>60 meters on each side</fact3>?

Answer: We are given that Kevin can mow a square lawn that is <fact1>30 meters of each side</fact1> in <fact2>45 minutes</fact2>. This means that the rate at which Kevin mows a lawn is constant, and it is determined by the time it takes him to mow a lawn of a certain size. Since we are asked to find the time it will take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures <fact3>60 meters on each side</fact3>, we can use the ratio of the areas of the two lawns to find the time. The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the two lawns is (60/30)^2 = 4. Since the time it takes Kevin to mow a lawn is directly proportional to the area of the lawn, we can multiply the time it takes him to mow the smaller lawn by 4 to find the time it will take him to mow the larger lawn. Therefore, the time it will take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures <fact3>60 meters on each side</fact3> is 4 * <fact2>45 minutes</fact2> = <fact4>180 minutes</fact4>. The answer is {180}."

How much money will Todd save?,"Reformatted Question: Chloe agreed to wash all of the windows in Todd's giant art studio. There are <fact1>400 square panes of glass</fact1> each measuring <fact2>2.5 feet</fact2> on each side. Todd offered to pay <fact3>10 cents per square foot</fact3>. Chloe said she would rather get paid <fact4>60 cents a pane</fact4>. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?

Answer: Todd offered to pay <fact3>10 cents per square foot</fact3> and each pane is <fact2>2.5 feet</fact2> on each side. That means each pane is <fact2>2.5</fact2> * <fact2>2.5</fact2> = 6.25 square feet. If Todd pays <fact3>10 cents per square foot</fact3>, then for each pane he will pay 6.25 * <fact3>10 cents</fact3> = 62.5 cents. Since Chloe gets paid <fact4>60 cents a pane</fact4>, she will pay 62.5 - <fact4>60 cents</fact4> = 2.5 cents less per pane. There are <fact1>400 square panes of glass</fact1> so Todd will save 400 * 2.5 cents = $10. The answer is {10}."
1507,Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?,"Reformatted Question: Grandma has an old family recipe for <fact1>blueberry pancakes</fact1>. She can make <fact2>8 pancakes</fact2> that are each <fact3>10 inches in diameter</fact3>. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only <fact4>2 inches in diameter</fact4>. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?

Answer: Grandma's recipe makes <fact2>8 pancakes</fact2> that are each <fact3>10 inches in diameter</fact3>. To find the total area of the large pancakes, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is 10 inches, the radius is 5 inches. So the area of each large pancake is A = π(5)^2 = 25π. The total area of the 8 large pancakes is 8 * 25π = 200π. Now, we want to find the number of small pancakes that have the same total area. The area of each small pancake is A = π(1)^2 = π. To find the number of small pancakes, we can divide the total area of the large pancakes by the area of each small pancake: 200π / π = 200. So, Grandma's recipe will make 200 small pancakes."
1508,Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?,"Reformatted Question: Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose <fact1>area is 400 square inches</fact1>. He makes sure that the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?

Answer: The area of the square is <fact1>400 square inches</fact1>. Since the circle touches each side of the square, the diameter of the circle must be equal to the side length of the square. The area of the square is found by squaring the side length, so the side length of the square is the square root of 400, which is 20 inches. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, the diameter of the circle is also 20 inches. The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so the radius of the circle is 10 inches. The area of a circle is found by squaring the radius and multiplying by pi, so the area of the circle is 10^2 * pi = 100 * pi square inches."

The total area of the smaller <fact2>squares</fact2> is <fact4>92 square centimeters</fact4>. What was the original length of wire?
Answer: The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side. Since each square has a side that measures <fact3>2 centimeters</fact3>, the area of each square is <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact3>2</fact3> = 4 square centimeters. The total area of the smaller squares is <fact4>92 square centimeters</fact4>, so the total number of squares is <fact4>92</fact4> / <fact3>4</fact3> = 23 squares. Since each square is a smaller piece of wire, the total number of smaller pieces is also 23. The original length of wire was cut into <fact1>several smaller pieces</fact1>, which is the same as the total number of smaller pieces, 23. Therefore, the original length of wire was 23 centimeters."

1517,Mika measures the lens on a magnifying glass and calculates that it has a circumference of 31.4 centimeters. What is the lens's diameter?,"Reformatted Question: Mika measures the lens on a magnifying glass and calculates that it has a <fact1>circumference</fact1> of <fact2>31.4 centimeters</fact2>. What is the lens's <fact3>diameter</fact3>?
Answer: The formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is <fact4>C = 2πr</fact4>, where <fact5>C</fact5> is the circumference and <fact6>r</fact6> is the radius. We are given that the circumference is <fact2>31.4 centimeters</fact2>. We can plug this value into the formula and solve for <fact6>r</fact6>. 

<fact4>C = 2πr</fact4> 
<fact2>31.4 = 2πr</fact2> 
<fact7>r = 31.4 / (2π)</fact7> 

Now that we have the radius, we can calculate the diameter using the formula <fact8>d = 2r</fact8>. 

<fact8>d = 2r</fact8> 
<fact8>d = 2 * (31.4 / (2π))</fact8>

1522,"An experienced ice skater spins on the ice, creating a perfect circle. Afterwards, she calculates that it must have a circumference of 6.28 yards. What is the circle's diameter?","Reformatted Question: An experienced ice skater spins on the ice, creating a perfect circle. Afterwards, she calculates that it must have a circumference of <fact1>6.28 yards</fact1>. What is the circle's <fact2>diameter</fact2>?
Answer: The formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. However, the question gives us the circumference, which is <fact1>6.28 yards</fact1>. We need to find the diameter, which is twice the radius. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the radius: r = C / (2π). 

To find the radius, we can plug in the value of the circumference: r = <fact1>6.28</fact1> / (2 * π). We know that π is approximately 3.14, so we can substitute this value: r = <fact1>6.28</fact1> / (2 * 3.14) = <fact1>6.28</fact1> / 6.28 = 1 yard. 

Since the diameter is twice the radius, the diameter is 2 * 1 = 2 yards."

1534,"A box of cupcakes cost $six. If you had eight hundred twenty-one dollars and bought as many boxes as you could, how much money would you have left?","Reformatted Question: A box of cupcakes cost <fact1>$6</fact1>. If you had <fact2>$821</fact2> and bought as many boxes as you could, how much money would you have left?

Answer: A box of cupcakes costs <fact1>$6</fact1>. If you have <fact2>$821</fact2> and you buy as many boxes as you can, you would have spent <fact2>$821</fact2> - (<fact1>$6</fact1> * number of boxes). Since you can't buy a fraction of a box, you need to find the largest number of boxes you can buy with <fact2>$821</fact2>. This is equivalent to finding the largest multiple of <fact1>$6</fact1> that is less than or equal to <fact2>$821</fact2>. To do this, you can divide <fact2>$821</fact2> by <fact1>$6</fact1> and take the floor of the result (i.e., round down to the nearest whole number). The result is the number of boxes you can buy. 

To find the number of boxes, we need to divide <fact2>$821</fact2> by <fact1>$6</fact1>. <fact2>$821</fact2> ÷ <fact1>$6</fact1> = 136.8333. The floor of 136.8333 is 136. 

So, you can buy 136 boxes of cupcakes. The total cost of the cupcakes is <fact1>$6</fact1> * 136 = $816. 

You have <fact2>$821</fact2> in the beginning, and you spent $816 on cupcakes. So, you have <fact2>$821</fact2> - $816 = $5 left."

If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?
Answer: They have <fact2>865 tickets</fact2> in total. They want to split them evenly among <fact1>9 friends</fact1>. To find out how many tickets each friend will get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends. This means each friend will get <fact2>865</fact2> ÷ <fact1>9</fact1> = 96 tickets. To find out how many tickets they need to buy in total, we need to multiply the number of tickets each friend will get by the number of friends. This means they need to buy <fact1>9</fact1> * <fact2>96</fact2> = 864 tickets. Since they already have <fact2>865 tickets</fact2>, they actually have one more ticket than they need."
1537,"Tom has to sell eight hundred forty-nine chocolate bars to win a trip. If each box contains five chocolate bars, how many boxes will he need to sell to win the trip?","Reformatted Question: Tom has to sell <fact1>eight hundred forty-nine</fact1> chocolate bars to win a trip. If each box contains <fact2>five chocolate bars</fact2>, how many boxes will he need to sell to win the trip?
Answer: We need to find out how many boxes he needs to sell. Since each box contains <fact2>five chocolate bars</fact2>, the number of boxes he needs to sell will be the total number of chocolate bars he needs to sell, <fact1>eight hundred forty-nine</fact1>, divided by the number of chocolate bars per box, <fact2>five</fact2>. To do this, we need to convert the number of chocolate bars to a numerical value. There are <fact3>eight</fact3> hundreds and <fact4>forty-nine</fact4> ones. So, the total number of chocolate bars is <fact3>8</fact3> * <fact5>100</fact5> + <fact4>49</fact4> = <fact6>849</fact6>. Now we can divide this number by <fact2>five</fact2> to find the number of boxes he needs to sell: <fact6>849</fact6> ÷ <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact7>169.8</fact7>.

How many more bottles will she need to buy on the <fact4>last day</fact4>?

Answer: Robin wants to drink <fact1>9 bottles of water</fact1> each day. To find out how many bottles she needs in total, we need to multiply the number of bottles she drinks each day by the number of days. However, the question does not provide the number of days, so we will assume that she will drink 9 bottles of water for <fact4>the number of days</fact4> that she has bought the bottles for. She bought <fact2>617 bottles</fact2> and she wants to drink <fact1>9 bottles of water</fact1> each day. This means she will need <fact2>617</fact2> / <fact1>9</fact1> = 68.55 days worth of bottles. Since she cannot buy a fraction of a bottle, we will round down to 68 days. If she buys <fact2>617</fact2> bottles and she will drink 9 bottles of water for 68 days, she will have enough bottles for 68 days. However, the question asks how many more bottles she will need to buy on the <fact4>last day</fact4>.

If each box can hold <fact2>three books</fact2>, how many boxes did she need?
Answer: To find the number of boxes needed, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each box can hold. The total number of books is <fact1>five hundred ninety</fact1>, and each box can hold <fact2>three books</fact2>. So, we divide <fact1>five hundred ninety</fact1> by <fact2>three</fact2>. 

We can start by dividing <fact1>five hundred ninety</fact1> by <fact2>three</fact2>. To do this, we can break down <fact1>five hundred ninety</fact1> into <fact3>500</fact3> and <fact4>90</fact4>. We can divide <fact3>500</fact3> by <fact2>three</fact2> to get <fact5>166.67</fact5>. Then, we can divide <fact4>90</fact4> by <fact2>three</fact2> to get <fact6>30</fact6>. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need to round up <fact5>166.67</fact5> to <fact7>167</fact7> and <fact6>30</fact6> is already a whole number.

If a company had <fact2>three hundred twenty-nine orange slices</fact2> to put into containers, how many more slices would they need to fill up the last container?

Answer: A container can hold <fact1>four orange slices</fact1>. This means we can divide the total number of slices by 4 to find out how many containers we can fill. The company has <fact2>three hundred twenty-nine orange slices</fact2>. To find out how many containers we can fill, we need to divide <fact2>three hundred twenty-nine</fact2> by <fact1>four</fact1>. 

We can calculate this by using division: <fact2>three hundred twenty-nine</fact2> ÷ <fact1>four</fact1> = 82.25. Since we can't fill a fraction of a container, we can fill 82 containers. 

To find out how many slices are in 82 containers, we can multiply the number of containers by the number of slices per container: 82 * <fact1>four</fact1> = 328. 

Since the company has <fact2>three hundred twenty-nine orange slices</fact2> and we can fill 82 containers with 328 slices, we can fill 82 containers with the slices they have. However, we can't fill the last container because we don't have enough slices. 

To find out how many slices we need to fill the last container, we can subtract the number of slices we have from the number of slices in the last container: <fact1>four</fact1> - (<fact2>three hundred twenty-nine</fact2> - 328) = <fact1>four</fact1> - 1 = 3.

If he wants to split the candy into <fact2>three bags</fact2> with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?

Answer: If Billy wants to split the candy into <fact2>three bags</fact2> with the same amount of candy in each bag, he needs to divide the total number of pieces by <fact2>3</fact2>. The total number of pieces is <fact1>650</fact1>. To find out how many pieces each bag should have, we need to divide <fact1>650</fact1> by <fact2>3</fact2>. This will give us 650 / 3 = 216.666... Since we can't have a fraction of a piece of candy, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. However, we are looking for how many more pieces he would need to make sure each bag had the same amount, so we need to find the difference between the total number of pieces and the number of pieces each bag should have. The number of pieces each bag should have is 216, and the total number of pieces is 650. Therefore, the difference is 650 - 216 = 434. However, since he is splitting the candy into three bags, we need to divide the difference by 3 to find out how many more pieces he needs. 434 / 3 = 144.666... However, since we can't have a fraction of a piece of candy, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. The answer is {145}."

She wanted to place the pennies into <fact2>nine stacks</fact2>, with the same amount in each stack. How many more pennies would she need so all the stacks would be equal?

Answer: To find out how many pennies Megan would need in each stack, we need to divide the total number of pennies by the number of stacks. The total number of pennies is <fact1>five hundred sixteen</fact1>, and the number of stacks is <fact2>nine</fact2>. 

<fact1>five hundred sixteen</fact1> ÷ <fact2>nine</fact2> = 57.555... Since we can't have a fraction of a penny, we will round down to 57 pennies per stack. 

To find out how many pennies Megan has in total, we multiply the number of pennies per stack by the number of stacks. However, we are asked how many more pennies she would need, so we will first find out how many pennies she would have in total if she had 57 pennies in each stack. 

<fact2>nine</fact2> * 57 = 513. 

However, Megan had <fact1>five hundred sixteen</fact1> pennies in the beginning. To find out how many more pennies she would need, we subtract the total number of pennies she had from the total number of pennies she would need. 

<fact2>nine</fact2> * 57 - <fact1>five hundred sixteen</fact1> = 513 - 516 = -3. 

Since we can't have a negative number of pennies, this means that Megan would need 3 more pennies so all the stacks would be equal."

1551,A post office has five hundred eighty-two pieces of junk mail they want to split evenly between seven mail trucks. How many extra pieces of junk mail will they have if they give each truck the same amount?,"Reformatted Question: A post office has <fact1>five hundred eighty-two pieces of junk mail</fact1> they want to split evenly between <fact2>seven mail trucks</fact2>. How many extra pieces of junk mail will they have if they give each truck the same amount?

Answer: To find out how many extra pieces of junk mail they will have, we need to first find out how many pieces of junk mail each truck will get. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of trucks. So, we will divide <fact1>582</fact1> by <fact2>7</fact2>. This is the same as finding the quotient of <fact1>582</fact1> and <fact2>7</fact2>. 

<fact1>582</fact1> ÷ <fact2>7</fact2> = 83.14 (rounded to two decimal places). This means each truck will get 83 pieces of junk mail. 

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of junk mail they will have in total if they give each truck 83 pieces of junk mail. We can do this by multiplying the number of pieces of junk mail each truck will get by the number of trucks. So, we will multiply 83 by 7. This is the same as finding the product of 83 and 7.

83 × 7 = 581. This means they will have 581 pieces of junk mail if they give each truck 83 pieces of junk mail. 

Now, we need to find out how many extra pieces of junk mail they will have. We can do this by subtracting the total number of pieces of junk mail they will have if they give each truck 83 pieces of junk mail from the total number of pieces of junk mail they have. So, we will subtract 581 from 582. This is the same as finding the difference between 582 and 581.

582 - 581 = 1. This means they will have 1 extra piece of junk mail if they give each truck the same amount."
1552,A cafeteria was putting milk cartons into stacks. They had seven hundred ninety-nine cartons and were putting them into stacks with six cartons in each stack. How many full stacks could they make?,"Reformatted Question: There were <fact1>seven hundred ninety-nine cartons</fact1> and they were putting them into stacks with <fact2>six cartons in each stack</fact2>. How many full stacks could they make?

Answer: They had <fact1>seven hundred ninety-nine cartons</fact1> and were putting them into stacks with <fact2>six cartons in each stack</fact2>. To find the number of full stacks, we need to divide the total number of cartons by the number of cartons in each stack. So, we will divide <fact1>seven hundred ninety-nine</fact1> by <fact2>six</fact2>. 

We can calculate this as follows: <fact1>seven hundred ninety-nine</fact1> = 799 and <fact2>six</fact2> = 6. Now, we divide 799 by 6. 

799 ÷ 6 = 133.1666... 

Since we can't have a fraction of a stack, we will round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of full stacks they could make is 133."
1553,"A store owner had six employees and bought five hundred eighty-three uniforms for them. If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?","Reformatted Question: A store owner had <fact1>six employees</fact1> and bought <fact2>five hundred eighty-three uniforms</fact2> for them. If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?

Answer: The store owner bought <fact2>583 uniforms</fact2> in total. He wants to give each of his <fact1>6 employees</fact1> the same number of uniforms. To find out how many uniforms each employee should get, we need to divide the total number of uniforms by the number of employees. This means we need to divide <fact2>583</fact2> by <fact1>6</fact1>. 

583 / 6 = 97.16666666666667

Since we can't give a fraction of a uniform, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means each employee should get 97 uniforms. 

Now, let's find out how many uniforms the store owner has in total. We know he bought <fact2>583 uniforms</fact2> and he wants to give each employee 97 uniforms. To find out how many uniforms he needs in total, we need to multiply the number of employees by the number of uniforms each employee should get. This means we need to multiply <fact1>6</fact1> by <fact2>97</fact2>.

6 * 97 = 582

The store owner needs a total of 582 uniforms. Since he already bought <fact2>583 uniforms</fact2>, he has 1 extra uniform. To find out how many more uniforms he should buy so he doesn't have any extra, we need to subtract the number of uniforms he needs from the number of uniforms he already bought. This means we need to subtract <fact2>583</fact2> - <fact2>582</fact2>.

583 - 582 = 1

The answer is {1}."

If each box of crayons has <fact2>four crayons</fact2> in it, how many full boxes does the machine make a day?

Answer: The machine makes <fact1>361 crayons</fact1> a day. Each box of crayons has <fact2>4 crayons</fact2> in it. To find out how many full boxes the machine makes a day, we need to divide the total number of crayons made by the number of crayons in each box. So, we divide <fact1>361</fact1> by <fact2>4</fact2>. 361 ÷ 4 = 90.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the machine makes 90 full boxes a day."

How many <fact3>packs of balloons</fact3> would he need to buy?
Answer: The clown needs <fact1>227 balloons</fact1> in total, but they only come in <fact2>packs of two</fact2>. This means we need to divide <fact1>227</fact1> by <fact2>2</fact2> to find out how many packs he needs to buy. The result is 227 ÷ 2 = 113.5. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, the clown needs to buy 114 packs of balloons."
1557,A botanist picked six hundred one flowers. She wanted to put them into eight bouquets with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?,"Reformatted Question: A botanist picked <fact1>six hundred one flowers</fact1>. She wanted to put them into <fact2>eight bouquets</fact2> with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?
Answer: The botanist picked <fact1>601 flowers</fact1> and wants to put them into <fact2>8 bouquets</fact2> with the same number of flowers in each. To find out how many flowers should be in each bouquet, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of bouquets. So, we need to divide <fact1>601</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2>. This will give us the number of flowers that should be in each bouquet. 

601 ÷ 8 = 75.125

Since the botanist wants the same number of flowers in each bouquet, she can't have a fraction of a flower. Therefore, she needs to have a total number of flowers that is a multiple of 8. The closest multiple of 8 to 601 is 608 (76 * 8). This means she needs to pick 7 more flowers so she doesn't have any extra."

Answer: The carpenter needs <fact1>6 sinks</fact1> for each house. He bought <fact2>266 sinks</fact2> in total. To find out how many houses this would cover, we need to divide the number of sinks he bought by the number of sinks needed per house. So, we have <fact2>266</fact2> ÷ <fact1>6</fact1> = 44.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a house, we round down to 44 houses. The answer is {44}."

If each package has <fact2>eight buckets in it</fact2>, how many packages will they need to buy?
Answer: To find out how many packages the movie theater needs, we need to divide the total number of buckets needed by the number of buckets in each package. This is because the number of buckets in each package is a factor of the total number of buckets needed. The total number of buckets needed is <fact1>four hundred twenty-six</fact1>. The number of buckets in each package is <fact2>eight</fact2>. So, the number of packages needed is <fact1>four hundred twenty-six</fact1> / <fact2>eight</fact2> = 53.25. Since we can't buy a fraction of a package, the movie theater will need to buy 54 packages to have enough buckets."
1560,"Vanessa had saved up eight hundred fifty-five quarters and decided to spend them on sodas. If it costs seven quarters for each soda from a soda machine, how many more quarters would she need to buy the final soda?","Reformatted Question: Vanessa had saved up <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1> and decided to spend them on sodas. If it costs <fact2>seven quarters for each soda</fact2> from a soda machine, how many more quarters would she need to buy the final soda?

Answer: Vanessa had <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1> in the beginning. She spent <fact2>seven quarters for each soda</fact2> on sodas. Let's find out how many sodas she can buy with <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1>. To do that, we need to divide <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1> by <fact2>seven quarters for each soda</fact2>. 

<fact1>Eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1> is equal to 855 quarters. Now we need to divide 855 by 7. 855 ÷ 7 = 122.14. Since we can't buy a fraction of a soda, we will round down to 122. This means she can buy 122 sodas with <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1>. 

To find out how many quarters she used, we need to multiply 122 by <fact2>seven quarters for each soda</fact2>. 122 * 7 = 854. This means she used 854 quarters on sodas. 

Now we need to find out how many quarters she has left. To do that, we need to subtract 854 from <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1>. 855 - 854 = 1. This means she has 1 quarter left. 

Since it costs <fact2>seven quarters for each soda</fact2> to buy a soda, we need to find out how many quarters she needs to buy the final soda. To do that, we need to subtract 1 from <fact2>seven quarters for each soda</fact2>. 7 - 1 = 6. This means she needs 6 quarters to buy the final soda."

Answer: Victor wanted to give <fact1>6 friends</fact1> an equal amount of candy. This means he should have bought <fact1>6</fact1> times the amount of candy he wanted each friend to have. He bought <fact2>379 pieces total</fact2>, so he has <fact2>379</fact2> pieces now. To find out how many pieces he should have bought, we need to divide <fact2>379</fact2> by <fact1>6</fact1> to find out how many pieces each friend should have. <fact2>379</fact2> ÷ <fact1>6</fact1> = 63.1666. Since he can't give a fraction of a piece of candy, he should have bought 63 pieces for each friend. So, the total number of pieces he should have bought is <fact1>6</fact1> * <fact2>63</fact2> = 378. To find out how many more pieces he should have bought, we need to subtract <fact2>378</fact2> from <fact2>379</fact2>. <fact2>379</fact2> - <fact2>378</fact2> = 1. The answer is {1}."

If a florist had <fact2>nine hundred five flowers</fact2> she wanted to put equally into vases, how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full?
Answer: To find the number of flowers in the last vase that isn't full, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers each vase can hold. The total number of flowers is <fact2>905</fact2> and the number of flowers each vase can hold is <fact1>7</fact1>. 

We can find the number of full vases by dividing <fact2>905</fact2> by <fact1>7</fact1>. 905 ÷ 7 = 129.2857. Since we can't have a fraction of a vase, we round down to 129 full vases. 

To find the number of flowers in the last vase that isn't full, we multiply the number of full vases by the number of flowers each vase can hold and subtract the result from the total number of flowers. The number of flowers in the last vase that isn't full is <fact2>905</fact2> - 129 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 905 - 903 = 2."

If you had <fact2>eight hundred sixty-eight tickets</fact2>, how many tickets would you have left if you rode it as many times as you could?
Answer: We know that the roller coaster costs <fact1>six tickets per ride</fact1>. This means that for every ride, we need <fact1>6</fact1> tickets. We also know that we have <fact2>868</fact2> tickets in total. To find out how many rides we can have, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets per ride. So, we have <fact2>868</fact2> ÷ <fact1>6</fact1> = 144.44. Since we can't have a fraction of a ride, we can only have 144 rides. For each ride, we need <fact1>6</fact1> tickets, so for 144 rides, we need 144 * <fact1>6</fact1> = 864 tickets. We had <fact2>868</fact2> tickets in the beginning, so now we have <fact2>868</fact2> - 864 = 4 tickets left. The answer is {4}."

If they wanted to have <fact2>six teams</fact2>, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

Answer: To find out how many more students would need to sign up, we need to find out how many students are on each team. Since there are <fact2>six teams</fact2> and the same number of students on each team, we can divide the total number of students by the number of teams. The total number of students is <fact1>nine hundred thirty-five</fact1>. We can divide this number by <fact2>six</fact2> to find out how many students are on each team. 

9 hundred thirty-five divided by 6 is 156.6666. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round down to 156 students per team. To find out how many students are on all six teams, we can multiply the number of students per team by the number of teams. 

156 students per team * 6 teams = 936 students. Since there are 935 students signed up, we need 936 - 935 = 1 more student to sign up. The answer is {1}."

If the ratio of <fact2>siamese cats</fact2> to <fact3>house cats</fact3> sold was <fact4>2:1</fact4>, what is the combined amount of <fact5>cats</fact5> sold?
Answer: The ratio of <fact2>siamese cats</fact2> to <fact3>house cats</fact3> sold was <fact4>2:1</fact4>. This means that for every 2 <fact2>siamese cats</fact2> sold, 1 <fact3>house cat</fact3> was sold. Since a total of <fact1>12 siamese cats</fact1> were sold, we can divide this number by 2 to find the number of sets of 2 <fact2>siamese cats</fact2> sold. This gives us <fact1>12</fact1> ÷ <fact4>2</fact4> = 6 sets. Since each set contains 1 <fact3>house cat</fact3>, we can multiply the number of sets by 1 to find the number of <fact3>house cats</fact3> sold. This gives us 6 sets × <fact4>1</fact4> = 6 <fact3>house cats</fact3>. To find the combined amount of <fact5>cats</fact5> sold, we can add the number of <fact2>siamese cats</fact2> sold to the number of <fact3>house cats</fact3> sold. This gives us <fact1>12</fact1> + 6 = 18 <fact5>cats</fact5>. The answer is {18}."
1690,"A cafeteria sold 49 cartons of regular flavored milk. If the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold was 7:2, what is the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold?","Reformatted Question: A cafeteria sold <fact1>49 cartons of regular flavored milk</fact1>. If the ratio of <fact2>regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold</fact2> was <fact3>7:2</fact3>, what is the combined amount of <fact4>chocolate and regular milk sold</fact4>?
Answer: The ratio of <fact2>regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold</fact2> is <fact3>7:2</fact3>. This means that for every <fact3>7</fact3> cartons of regular milk sold, there are <fact3>2</fact3> cartons of chocolate milk sold. We can use this information to find the total number of cartons of chocolate milk sold. Let's assume the total number of cartons of chocolate milk sold is <fact5>x</fact5>. Since the ratio of regular milk to chocolate milk is <fact3>7:2</fact3>, we can set up the following proportion: 7/2 = 49/x. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and get 7x = 49 * 2. This simplifies to 7x = 98. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 98/7 = 14. So the total number of cartons of chocolate milk sold is 14. The combined amount of <fact4>chocolate and regular milk sold</fact4> is the sum of the cartons of chocolate milk and regular milk, which is 14 + 49 = 63. The answer is {63}."

If there are <fact4>45 sugar cones</fact4> sold, how many <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> would be sold?
Answer: The ratio of <fact1>sugar cones sold</fact1> to <fact2>waffle cones sold</fact2> is <fact3>5:4</fact3>. This means that for every 5 <fact1>sugar cones sold</fact1>, there are 4 <fact2>waffle cones sold</fact2>. We know that there are <fact4>45 sugar cones</fact4> sold. To find the number of <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> sold, we can set up a proportion: 5/4 = 45/x, where x is the number of <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> sold. We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying: 5x = 4(45), which gives us 5x = 180. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 36. Therefore, there are 36 <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> sold. The answer is {36}."

She used <fact2>eighty-six</fact2> for <fact3>roast chicken for dinner</fact3>. How many cloves of garlic does she have left?

Answer: Maria initially stored <fact1>ninety-three cloves of garlic</fact1> in the kitchen. She used <fact2>eighty-six</fact2> for <fact3>roast chicken for dinner</fact3>. To find out how many cloves of garlic she has left, we need to subtract the number of cloves she used from the total number of cloves she stored.

If she finished <fact3>44 of the problems at school</fact3>, how many problems did she have to do for homework?
Answer: There were <fact1>43 math problems</fact1> and <fact2>12 science problems</fact2> for homework in total. She finished <fact3>44 problems at school</fact3>. Since the number of math and science problems is less than the number of problems she finished at school, the problems she finished at school must be the total of both math and science problems plus some extra. This means that she must have finished <fact1>43</fact1> + <fact2>12</fact2> = 55 problems in total. However, she only finished <fact3>44 problems at school</fact3>, which is less than 55. This means that she did not finish all of her homework at school. Since she finished <fact3>44 problems at school</fact3> and she had <fact1>43 math problems</fact1> and <fact2>12 science problems</fact2> in total, she must have finished all of her math problems and 8 of her science problems at school.

If she gave her mother <fact3>34 of them</fact3>, how many towels did Maria end up with?
Answer: Maria bought <fact1>35 green towels</fact1> and <fact2>21 white towels</fact2> in total, that makes <fact1>35</fact1> + <fact2>21</fact2> = 56 towels. If she gave her mother <fact3>34 towels</fact3>, she must have given away the same number of towels from <fact1>green</fact1> and <fact2>white</fact2> towels, since the question doesn't specify which type of towels she gave her mother. This means she gave her mother <fact3>34</fact3> towels from the 56 towels she bought. So, she must have given away <fact1>34</fact1> / <fact2>56</fact2> = 0.6071, which means she gave away 0.6071 of the 56 towels she bought. To find out how many towels she gave away, we can multiply the total number of towels by 0.6071, which is 56 * 0.6071 = 34 towels. So, she gave away 34 towels. This means she has 56 - 34 = 22 towels left. The answer is {22}."

The president wants to break the club into groups, with each group containing the same combination of <fact3>girls and boys</fact3>. The president also wants to make sure that no one is left out. What is the greatest number of groups the president can make?

Answer: The president wants to make sure that no one is left out. This means that the number of groups should be a factor of the total number of members, which is <fact1>16 girls</fact1> + <fact2>8 boys</fact2> = 24 members. 

The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The president wants each group to have the same combination of <fact3>girls and boys</fact3>. This means that the number of girls and boys in each group should be equal. 

Since there are more girls than boys, the number of girls in each group should be less than or equal to the number of boys in each group. The only possible combinations are 2 girls and 1 boy, 1 girl and 2 boys, or 4 girls and 2 boys. However, 4 girls and 2 boys is not a factor of 24, so it is not possible.

The factors of 24 that correspond to the possible combinations are 2 (2 girls and 1 boy), 4 (2 girls and 1 boy), 6 (1 girl and 2 boys), 8 (1 girl and 2 boys), 12 (2 girls and 1 boy), and 24 (2 girls and 1 boy). The greatest number of groups the factors is 6."

2020,"Tayli wishes to advertise her business, so she gives packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner. At the end of the day, Tayli realizes that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. What is the minimum number of flyers of each color she distributed?","Reformatted Question: Tayli wishes to advertise her business, so she gives <fact1>packs of 13 red flyers</fact1> to each restaurant owner and <fact2>sets of 20 blue flyers</fact2> to each clothing store owner. At the end of the day, Tayli realizes that she gave out the same number of <fact3>red and blue flyers</fact3>. What is the minimum number of <fact4>flyers of each color</fact4> she distributed?

Answer: Let's denote the number of restaurant owners as R and the number of clothing store owners as C. Since Tayli gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, the total number of red flyers is equal to the total number of blue flyers. The total number of red flyers is 13R and the total number of blue flyers is 20C. Since they are equal, we can set up the equation 13R = 20C. To find the minimum number of flyers of each color, we need to find the smallest values of R and C that satisfy this equation. We can start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 13 and 20, which is 1. This means that R and C must be multiples of 1, and the smallest possible values are R = 20 and C = 13. Therefore, the minimum number of red flyers is 13 * 20 = 260, and the minimum number of blue flyers is 20 * 13 = 260."

She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are left over. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?

Answer: Since Aylin wants to make sure that no items are left over, the number of photos and newspaper clippings on each page must be a factor of both <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>20</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>18</fact1> are <fact3>1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18</fact3> and the factors of <fact2>20</fact2> are <fact4>1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20</fact4>. The common factors of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>20</fact2> are <fact5>1, 2</fact5>. 

Since Aylin wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, the number of photos and newspaper clippings on each page must be the same. Therefore, the number of photos and newspaper clippings on each page must be <fact5>1</fact5> or <fact5>2</fact5>. 

If the number of photos and newspaper clippings on each page is <fact5>1</fact5>, then the number of pages is <fact1>18</fact1> / <fact5>1</fact5> = <fact6>18</fact6> and <fact2>20</fact2> / <fact5>1</fact5> = <fact7>20</fact7>. However, this would leave <fact6>18</fact6> - <fact8>1</fact8> = <fact9>17</fact9> photos left over and <fact7>20</fact7> - <fact8>1</fact8> = <fact10>19</fact10> newspaper clippings left over, which is not allowed. 

If the number of photos and newspaper clippings on each page is <fact5>2</fact5>, then the number of pages is <fact1>18</fact1> / <fact5>2</fact5> = <fact11>9</fact11> and <fact2>20</fact2> / <fact5>2</fact5> = <fact12>10</fact12>.

2025,"Two bikers are riding a circular path. The first rider completes a round in 12 minutes. The second rider completes a round in 18 minutes. If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?","Reformatted Question: Two bikers are riding a circular path. The first rider completes a round in <fact1>12 minutes</fact1>. The second rider completes a round in <fact2>18 minutes</fact2>. If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?
Answer: The first rider completes a round in <fact1>12 minutes</fact1>, so in that time he will have traveled a certain distance. The second rider completes a round in <fact2>18 minutes</fact2>, so in that time he will have traveled a different distance. The distance traveled by the first rider in <fact1>12 minutes</fact1> will be equal to the distance traveled by the second rider in <fact3>some multiple of 18 minutes</fact3>. This is because they are traveling in the same direction and will meet again at the starting point. Since the first rider completes a round in <fact1>12 minutes</fact1> and the second rider completes a round in <fact2>18 minutes</fact2>, the least common multiple of 12 and 18 is 36. Therefore, the first rider will have completed 3 rounds in 36 minutes and the second rider will have completed 2 rounds in 36 minutes. This means that in 36 minutes, they will meet again at the starting point."
2026,Sean has 8-inch pieces of toy train track and Ruth has 18-inch pieces of train track. How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?,"Reformatted Question: Sean has <fact1>8-inch pieces</fact1> of toy train track and Ruth has <fact2>18-inch pieces</fact2> of train track. How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?
Answer: To find the number of pieces each child needs to build tracks that are equal in length, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 18. 

The LCM of 8 and 18 is 72. This means that both Sean and Ruth need to have 72-inch tracks to build tracks that are equal in length. 

Now, we need to find out how many 8-inch pieces Sean needs to build a 72-inch track. We can do this by dividing 72 by 8. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9. 

So, Sean needs 9 pieces of 8-inch train track. 

Similarly, we need to find out how many 18-inch pieces Ruth needs to build a 72-inch track. We can do this by dividing 72 by 18. 

72 ÷ 18 = 4. 

So, Ruth needs 4 pieces of 18-inch train track."

2031,"Enzo and Beatriz are playing games at their local arcade. Incredibly, Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game, and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game. When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets. What is the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played?","Reformatted Question: Enzo and <fact1>Beatriz</fact1> are playing games at their local arcade. Incredibly, Enzo wins <fact2>5 tickets</fact2> from every game, and <fact3>Beatriz</fact3> wins <fact4>11 tickets</fact4> from every game. When they stopped playing games, <fact5>Enzo</fact5> and <fact6>Beatriz</fact6> had won the same number of total tickets. What is the minimum number of games that <fact5>Enzo</fact5> could have played?

Answer: Since Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's say Enzo played x games and Beatriz played y games. Since Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game, the total number of tickets won by Enzo is 5x and the total number of tickets won by Beatriz is 11y. Since they have the same number of total tickets, we can set up the equation 5x = 11y. To find the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies this equation. Since x and y are integers, we can try to find the smallest value of x that makes 5x a multiple of 11. By trial and error, we can find that x = 11 satisfies this condition, and in this case, y = 5. Therefore, the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played is 11."

The store does not sell <fact5>parts of a pack</fact5> and Yadira's mom wants the <fact6>same number of hot dogs as hot dog buns</fact6>. What is the <fact7>smallest total number of hot dogs</fact7> that Yadira's mom can purchase?

Answer: We want the <fact7>smallest total number of hot dogs</fact7> that Yadira's mom can purchase. This means we want the smallest number of packs of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can buy. Since <fact3>hot dogs come in packs of 12</fact3> and <fact4>hot dog buns come in packs of 9</fact4>, the number of hot dogs in each pack must be a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 12 that is also a multiple of 9 is 36. So, Yadira's mom must buy at least 3 packs of hot dogs. The total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase is 3 * 12 = 36."

A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?","Reformatted Question: Miranda and Savannah are excited that a new store just opened in town! They go together the first day it opens! Each time Miranda goes to the store she plans to spend <fact1>$7</fact1>, and each time Savannah goes to the store she plans to spend <fact2>$9</fact2>. A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?

Answer: Let's denote the number of times Miranda has been to the store as 'm' and the number of times Savannah has been to the store as 's'. We know that each time Miranda goes to the store she spends <fact1>$7</fact1> and each time Savannah goes to the store she spends <fact2>$9</fact2>. Since they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store, we can set up the equation: 

<fact1>$7m</fact1> = <fact2>$9s</fact2>

We want to find the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store, so we need to find the smallest value of 'm'. To do this, we can try to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 9. The GCD of 7 and 9 is 1, so the smallest value of 'm' is 9. 

However, this is not the correct answer because Miranda cannot go to the store 9 times and spend the same amount of money as Savannah who goes 1 time. We need to find the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 7. This is 9*2 = 18. 

However, this is still not the correct answer because Miranda cannot go to the store 18 times and spend the same amount of money as who goes 2 times. We need to find the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 7 and can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*2 = 18. We can express 18 as 7*2 + 4, so the smallest value of 'm' is 2 + 4/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*3 = 27. We can express 27 as 7*3 + 6, so the smallest value of 'm' is 3 + 6/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*4 = 36. We can express 36 as 7*4 + 4, so the smallest value of 'm' is 4 + 4/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*5 = 45. We can express 45 as 7*6 + 3, so the smallest value of 'm' is 6 + 3/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*6 = 54. We can express 54 as 7*7 + 1, so the smallest value of 'm' is 7 + 1/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*7 = 63. We can express 63 as 7*9, so the smallest value of 'm' is 9. 

However, this is still not the correct answer because Miranda cannot go to the store 9 times and spend the same amount of money as who goes 1 time. We need to find the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 7 and can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*2 = 18. We can express 18 as 7*2 + 4, so the smallest value of 'm' is 2 + 4/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*3 = 27. We can express 27 as 7*3 + 6, so the smallest value of 'm' is 3 + 6/7. However, 'm' must be an integer, so we need to find the next multiple of 9 that can be expressed as 7m. This is 9*"

Abe would like to plant the trees in rows that all have the same number of trees and are made up of only one type of tree. What is the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row?

Answer: To find the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

First, let's find the factors of <fact1>54</fact1> and <fact2>27</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>54</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. The factors of <fact2>27</fact2> are 1, 3, 9, and 27.

Jazmin wants to cut the paper into <fact4>strips that are equal in width</fact4> and are as <fact5>wide as possible</fact5>. How <fact6>wide should Jazmin cut each strip</fact6>?

Answer: To find the width of each strip, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two widths, <fact2>44 inches</fact2> and <fact3>33 inches</fact3>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. 

We can find the GCD by listing the factors of each number. The factors of <fact2>44</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, and 44. The factors of <fact3>33</fact3> are 1, 3, 11, and 33. 

The greatest common factor of <fact2>44</fact2> and <fact3>33</fact3> is <fact7>11</fact7>. Therefore, Jazmin should cut each strip <fact7>11 inches</fact7> wide."

Remarkably, Sam knocks down <fact2>8 pins</fact2> on every bowl, and Carlos knocks down <fact3>9 pins</fact3> on every bowl. At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?

Answer: Let's consider the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down. Since Sam knocks down <fact2>8 pins</fact2> and Carlos knocks down <fact3>9 pins</fact3> on every bowl, the number of bowls they each bowled must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9. The LCM of 8 and 9 is 72. This means that Sam and Carlos each bowled at least 72 times. 

If Sam and Carlos each bowled 72 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 72 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 576 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 72 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 648 pins. However, we are looking for the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, and since they have the same total number of pins, we can take the smaller total, which is 576. However, we need to check if this is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down. 

To check this, we can try a smaller multiple of 72. If we let Sam and Carlos each bowled 36 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 36 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 288 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 36 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 324 pins. This is not the same total number of pins. 

However, if we try a smaller multiple of 72, we get 24. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 24 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 24 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 192 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 24 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 216 pins. This is still not the same total number of pins. 

If we try a smaller multiple of 72, we get 18. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 18 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 18 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 144 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 18 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 162 pins. This is still not the same total number of pins. 

However, if we try a smaller multiple of 72, we get 12. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 12 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 12 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 96 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 12 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 108 pins. This is still not the same total number of pins. 

If we try a smaller multiple of 72, we get 9. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 9 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 9 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 72 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 9 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 81 pins. This is still not the same total number of pins. 

If we try a smaller multiple of 72, we get 6. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 6 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 6 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 48 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 6 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 54 pins. This is still not the same total number of pins. 

However, if we try a smaller multiple of 4. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 4 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 4 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 32 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 4 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 36 pins. This is still not the same total number of pins. 

If we try a smaller multiple of 72, we get 3. If Sam and Carlos each bowled 3 times, then Sam knocked down a total of 3 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 24 pins, and Carlos knocked down a total of 3 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 27 pins. This is still not the same"

What is the greatest number of identical packages that <fact4>Shaquira can make</fact4>?

Answer: To find the greatest number of identical packages, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of sugar cookies. The GCD of <fact1>86</fact1> and <fact2>42</fact2> is 2. This means that the greatest number of identical packages that Shaquira can make is 2."
2042,"There are 32 forwards and 80 guards in Leo's basketball league. Leo must include all players on a team and wants each team to have the same number of forwards and the same number of guards. If Leo creates the greatest number of teams possible, how many guards will be on each team?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>32 forwards</fact1> and <fact2>80 guards</fact2> in Leo's basketball league. Leo must include all players on a team and wants each team to have the same number of <fact3>forwards</fact3> and the same number of <fact4>guards</fact4>. If Leo creates the greatest number of teams possible, how many <fact5>guards</fact5> will be on each team?

Answer: Leo has <fact2>80 guards</fact2> in total. He also has <fact1>32 forwards</fact1>. Since he wants each team to have the same number of <fact3>forwards</fact3> and <fact4>guards</fact4>, the number of guards on each team must be a factor of <fact2>80</fact2>. 

We can find the factors of <fact2>80</fact2> by listing all the numbers that divide <fact2>80</fact2> evenly. The factors of <fact2>80</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 80.

Since Leo wants to create the greatest number of teams possible, he should choose the largest factor of <fact2>80</fact2> as the number of guards on each team. The largest factor of <fact2>80</fact2> is 80. However, if he creates teams with 80 guards, he will only be able to create 1 team because he only has 80 guards.

If he creates teams with 40 guards, he will be able to create 2 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 / 40 = 2. 

If he creates teams with 20 guards, he will be able to create 4 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 20 = 4.

If he creates teams with 16 guards, he will be able to create 5 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 16 = 5.

If he creates teams with 10 guards, he will be able to create 8 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 10 = 8.

If he creates teams with 8 guards, he will be able to create 10 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 8 = 10.

If he creates teams with 5 guards, he will be able to create 16 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 5 = 16.

If he creates teams with 4 guards, he will be able to create 20 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 4 = 20.

If he creates teams with 2 guards, he will be able to create 40 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 2 = 40.

If he creates teams with 1 guard, he will be able to create 80 teams because he has 80 guards and 80 1 = 80.

So, Leo can create the greatest number of teams possible with 1 guard on each team. The answer is {1}."
2043,Li Na is going to plant 63 tomato plants and 81 rhubarb plants. Li Na would like to plant the plants in rows where each row has the same number of tomato plants and each row has the same number of rhubarb plants. What is the greatest number of rows Li Na can plant?,"Reformatted Question: Li Na is going to plant <fact1>63 tomato plants</fact1> and <fact2>81 rhubarb plants</fact2>. Li Na would like to plant the plants in rows where each row has the same number of <fact1>tomato plants</fact1> and each row has the same number of <fact2>rhubarb plants</fact2>. What is the greatest number of rows Li Na can plant?
Answer: To find the greatest number of rows Li Na can plant, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>63</fact1> and <fact2>81</fact2>. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. The steps of the Euclidean algorithm are as follows:

1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is zero.

Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of <fact1>63</fact1> and <fact2>81</fact2>:

1. Divide 81 by 63: 81 = 63 * 1 + 18
2. Replace 81 with 63 and 63 with 18: 63 = 18 * 3 + 9
3. Replace 63 with 18 and 18 with 9: 18 = 9 * 2 + 0

Since the remainder is zero, the GCD of <fact1>63</fact1> and <fact2>81</fact2> is 9.

Therefore, the greatest number of rows Li Na can plant is 9."
2044,"There are 72 boys and 90 girls on the math team. For the next math competition, Mr. Johnson would like to arrange all of the students in equal rows with only girls or only boys in each row. What is the greatest number of students that can be in each row?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>72 boys</fact1> and <fact2>90 girls</fact2> on the math team. For the next math competition, Mr. Johnson would like to arrange all of the students in equal rows with only girls or only boys in each row. What is the greatest number of students that can be in each row?

Answer: To find the greatest number of students that can be in each row, we need to consider the factors of the total number of students. The total number of students is <fact1>72 boys</fact1> + <fact2>90 girls</fact2> = 162. We need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 72 and 90, as this will give us the maximum number of students that can be in each row. 

To find the GCF, we can list the factors of 72 and 90. The factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. The factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. The greatest common factor of 72 and 90 is 18. Therefore, the greatest number of students that can be in each row is 18."
2045,"Rafaela is a physical education teacher and has 25 girls and 35 boys in her class. She wants to divide the class into teams of the same size, where each team has the same number of girls and the same number of boys. If Rafaela creates the greatest number of teams possible, how many boys will be on each team?","Reformatted Question: Rafaela is a physical education teacher and has <fact1>25 girls</fact1> and <fact2>35 boys</fact2> in her class. She wants to divide the class into teams of the same size, where each team has the same number of <fact3>girls</fact3> and the same number of <fact4>boys</fact4>. If Rafaela creates the greatest number of teams possible, how many <fact5>boys</fact5> will be on each team?

Answer: To find the number of boys on each team, we first need to find the greatest number of teams possible. Since each team has the same number of girls and boys, the number of teams is determined by the smaller of the two numbers, which is <fact1>25 girls</fact1>. We can divide <fact1>25</fact1> by the number of boys on each team to find the number of teams, but we don't know that number yet. Let's call it <fact6>x</fact6>. So, we have the equation <fact1>25</fact1> = <fact6>x</fact6> * <fact5>number of boys on each team</fact5>. Since <fact2>35 boys</fact2> is the total number of boys, we also have the equation <fact2>35</fact2> = <fact6>x</fact6> * <fact5>number of boys on each team</fact5>. Now we have two equations with two unknowns, <fact6>x</fact6> and <fact5>number of boys on each team</fact5>. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of <fact5>number of boys on each team</fact5>. Since we are looking for the greatest number of teams possible, we want to find the largest possible value of <fact6>x</fact6>, which is the number of teams. We can do this by dividing <fact1>25</fact1> and <fact2>35</fact2> and finding the largest integer that is less than or equal to the result. The result of dividing <fact1>25</fact1> by <fact2>35</fact2> is approximately 0.7143. The largest integer that is less than or equal to 0.7143 is 0. So, the greatest number of teams possible is 0. However, this is not possible, since we have 35 boys and we can't divide them into teams of 0 boys. Let's try to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>25</fact1> and <fact2>35</fact2>, which is the largest number that divides both <fact1>25</fact1> and <fact2>35</fact2> without leaving a remainder. The GCD of <fact1>25</fact1> and <fact2>35</fact2> is 5. Now we can divide <fact1>25</fact1> and <fact2>35</fact2> by 5 to find the number of teams and the number of boys on each team. We have <fact1>25</fact1> = 5 * 5 and <fact2>35</fact2> = 5 * 7. So, the greatest number of teams possible is 5 and the number of boys on each team is 7. The answer is {7}."

What is the greatest number of <fact4>snack bags</fact4> that Destiny can make?

Answer: Destiny has <fact2>18 chocolate candy bars</fact2> and <fact3>12 cookies</fact3>. Since she wants to make <fact4>identical snack bags</fact4> and she has <fact5>cousins</fact5> to give them to, she can divide the items between the snack bags in any way she wants, as long as each bag has the same number of items. To find the greatest number of snack bags she can make, we need to find the greatest number of items that can be divided evenly between the snack bags. The greatest common divisor of <fact2>18</fact2> and <fact3>12</fact3> is 6, so Destiny can make 18/6 = 3 snack bags with 6 chocolate candy bars and 6 cookies in each bag."

Ronald does laundry <fact2>every 6 days</fact2> and <fact3>Tim does laundry every 9 days</fact3>. How many days will it be until <fact1>Ronald and Tim both do laundry on the same day again</fact1>?

Answer: Since Ronald does laundry <fact2>every 6 days</fact2>, it will take him <fact2>6</fact2> days to do laundry again. Similarly, since Tim does laundry <fact3>every 9 days</fact3>, it will take him <fact3>9</fact3> days to do laundry again. To find the next day when they both do laundry, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact2>6</fact2> and <fact3>9</fact3>. The multiples of <fact2>6</fact2> are 6, 12, 18, 24, ... and the multiples of <fact3>9</fact3> are 9, 18, 27, 36, ... .

2049,"By coincidence, Luther's Paint Supplies sold equal quantities of two paint colors yesterday: yellow and blue. All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?","Reformatted Question: Luther's Paint Supplies sold equal quantities of two paint colors yesterday: <fact1>yellow and blue</fact1>. All <fact2>yellow paint</fact2> comes in <fact3>2-liter containers</fact3> while <fact4>blue paint</fact4> is sold in containers of <fact5>19 liters</fact5>. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?

Answer: Since we know that the store sold equal quantities of <fact1>yellow and blue paint</fact1>, we can let the quantity of each paint color be x. We also know that all <fact2>yellow paint</fact2> comes in <fact3>2-liter containers</fact3>, so the total amount of <fact2>yellow paint</fact2> sold is 2x. Similarly, we know that <fact4>blue paint</fact4> is sold in containers of <fact5>19 liters</fact5>, so the total amount of <fact4>blue paint</fact4> sold is 19x. Since the store sold equal quantities of each paint color, we can set up the equation 2x = 19x and solve for x. However, this equation has no solution, which means that the store cannot have sold equal quantities of <fact1>yellow and blue paint</fact1> in terms of liters. 

However, we can still find the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 19. The LCM of 2 and 19 is 38, so the store must have sold at least 19x = 38 liters of <fact4>blue paint</fact4> and 2x = 38 liters of <fact2>yellow paint</fact>. Therefore, the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold is <fact4>38 liters of blue paint</fact4> and <fact2>38 liters of yellow paint</fact>."

The multiples of <fact1>13</fact1> are 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130, 143, 156, 169, 182, 195, 208, 221, 234, 247, 260, 273, 286, 299, 312, 325, 338, 351, 364, 377, 390, 403, 416, 429, 442, 455, 468, 481, 494, 507, 520, 533, 546, 559, 572, 585, 598, 611, 624, 637, 650, 663, 676, 689, 702, 715, 728, 741, 754, 767, 780, 793, 806, 819, 832, 845, 858, 871, 884, 897, 910, 923, 936, 949, 962, 975, 988, 1001, 1014, 1027, 1040, 1053, 1066, 1079, 1092, 1105, 1118, 1131, 1144, 1157, 1170, 1183, 1196, 1209, 1222, 1235, 1248, 1261, 1274, 1287, 1300, 1313, 1326, 1339, 1352, 1365, 1378, 1391, 1404, 1417, 1430, 1443, 1456, 1469, 1482, 1495, 1508, 1521, 1534, 1547, 1560, 1573, 1586, 1599, 1612, 1625, 1638, 1651, 1664, 1677, 1690, 1703, 1716, 1729, 1742, 1755, 1768, 1781, 1794, 1807, 1820, 1833, 1846, 1859, 1872, 1885, 1898, 1911, 1924, 1937, 1950, 1963, 1976, 1989, 2002, 2015, 2028, 2041, 2054, 2067, 2080, 2093, 2106, 2119, 2132, 2145, 2158, 2171, 2184, 2197, 2210, 2223, 2236, 2249, 2262, 2275, 2288, 2301, 2314, 2327, 2340, 2353, 2366, 2379, 2392, 2405, 2418, 2431, 2444, 2457, 2470, 2483, 2496, 2509, 2522, 2535, 2548, 2561, 2574, 2587, 2600, 2613, 2626, 2639, 2652, 2665, 2678, 2691, 2704, 2717, 2730, 2743, 2756, 2769, 2782, 2795, 2808, 2821, 2834, 2847, 2860, 2873, 2886, 2899, 2912, 292"
2056,"The Khan Corporation would like to donate 48 computers and 32 printers to local schools. The corporation would like to make sure that each school receives the same set of computers and printers, with none left over. What is the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to?","Reformatted Question: The Khan Corporation would like to donate <fact1>48 computers</fact1> and <fact2>32 printers</fact2> to local schools. The corporation would like to make sure that each school receives the same set of <fact1>computers</fact1> and <fact2>printers</fact2>, with none left over. What is the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to?
Answer: To find the greatest number of schools, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>48 computers</fact1> and <fact2>32 printers</fact2>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both <fact1>48</fact1> and <fact2>32</fact2> without leaving a remainder. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

First, we divide <fact1>48</fact1> by <fact2>32</fact2> and get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16. Then, we divide <fact2>32</fact2> by <fact3>16</fact3> and get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is <fact3>16</fact3>.

Now, we can divide the total number of <fact1>computers</fact1> and <fact2>printers</fact2> by the GCD to find the greatest number of schools: <fact1>48</fact1> ÷ <fact3>16</fact3> = 3 and <fact2>32</fact2> ÷ <fact3>16</fact3> = 2. However, since the number of schools must be the same for both <fact1>computers</fact1> and <fact2>printers</fact2>, the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to is the smaller of the two, which is 2."

He wants each group to have the same combination of <fact1>sopranos</fact1> and <fact2>altos</fact2>, with no singers left over. What is the greatest number of groups he can make?
Answer: To find the greatest number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>10</fact1> and <fact2>15</fact2>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both <fact1>10</fact1> and <fact2>15</fact2> without leaving a remainder.

Answer: The first clock rings after every <fact1>90 minutes</fact1>, and the second after every <fact2>60 minutes</fact2>. This means that every <fact1>90</fact1> minutes, the first clock will ring, and every <fact2>60</fact2> minutes, the second clock will ring. To find when they will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>90</fact1> and <fact2>60</fact2>.

2063,"P and Q start at the same time in the same direction to run around a stadium. P completes a round in 252 seconds and Q in 198 seconds, both starting at the same point. After what time will they meet again at the starting point?","Reformatted Question: P and Q start at the same time in the same direction to run around a stadium. P completes a round in <fact1>252 seconds</fact1> and Q in <fact2>198 seconds</fact2>, both starting at the same point. After what time will they meet again at the starting point?
Answer: Since P completes a round in <fact1>252 seconds</fact1> and Q in <fact2>198 seconds</fact2>, we can find the time it takes for them to meet again at the starting point by finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 252 and 198. 

To find the LCM of 252 and 198, we can first find the prime factorization of each number. 

252 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 
198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 

Now, we can find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. 

LCM(252, 198) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 
               = 4 * 9 * 7 * 11 
               = 2772 

Therefore, P and Q will meet again at the starting point after 2772 seconds."
2064,"There are less than 6 dozen eggs in a basket. If the eggs are counted 2, 3, 4, or 5 at a time, there are none left over.

If the eggs are counted <fact2>2, 3, 4, or 5 at a time</fact2>, there are <fact3>none left over</fact3>. How many eggs are there in the basket?

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 5. This is because the number of eggs must be a multiple of all these numbers in order to have none left over when counted in any of these ways. The LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60. However, we are told that there are less than 6 dozen eggs, which means there are less than 72 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs in the basket must be 60, which is the largest multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5 that is less than 72. The answer is {60}."

If he just struck both at the same time, how many seconds will pass before he again strikes them at the same time?

Answer: We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>9 seconds</fact1> and <fact2>12 seconds</fact2> to determine how many seconds will pass before Bob strikes the drums and cymbals at the same time again. To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number:

- Multiples of <fact2>12 seconds</fact2>: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, ...

The first number that appears in both lists is <fact2>36 seconds</fact2>, which is the LCM of <fact1>9 seconds</fact1> and <fact2>12 seconds</fact2>. Therefore, it will take <fact2>36 seconds</fact2> for Bob to strike the drums and cymbals at the same time again. The answer is {36}."

While the <fact3>sparrows</fact3> were in <fact4>flocks of 13</fact4>, the <fact5>parrots</fact5> were in <fact6>flocks of 14</fact6>. If Bill observed the same total number of <fact3>sparrows</fact3> and <fact5>parrots</fact5>, what is the smallest number of <fact3>sparrows</fact3> that he could have observed?

Answer: Let's denote the number of sparrows as S and the number of parrots as P. We know that S = P (since Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots). We also know that the number of sparrows is a multiple of 13 and the number of parrots is a multiple of 14. 

To find the smallest number of sparrows, we need to find the smallest multiple of 13 that is equal to a multiple of 14. 

Since 13 and 14 are relatively prime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1), the smallest multiple of 13 that is equal to a multiple of 14 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 14.

The LCM of 13 and 14 is 182. 

Therefore, the smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is 182."

If Morris observed the same total number of <fact7>ducks</fact7> and <fact8>cranes</fact8>, what is the smallest number of <fact7>ducks</fact7> that he could have observed?

Answer: Since Morris observed the same total number of <fact7>ducks</fact7> and <fact8>cranes</fact8>, let's denote this total number as <fact9>x</fact9>. This means the number of <fact7>ducks</fact7> is <fact9>x</fact9> and the number of <fact8>cranes</fact8> is also <fact9>x</fact9>. The number of <fact7>ducks</fact7> is a multiple of <fact4>13</fact4> and the number of <fact8>cranes</fact8> is a multiple of <fact6>17</fact6>. To find the smallest number of <fact7>ducks</fact7> that Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallest multiple of <fact4>13</fact4> that is also a multiple of <fact6>17</fact6>. Since <fact6>17</fact6> is a prime number, the smallest multiple of <fact4>13</fact4> that is also a multiple of <fact6>17</fact6> is the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact4>13</fact4> and <fact6>17</fact6>.

2080,Two wires with lengths of 448 cm and 616 cm are to be cut into pieces of all the same length without remainder. What is the greatest possible length of the pieces?,"Reformatted Question: Two wires with lengths of <fact1>448 cm</fact1> and <fact2>616 cm</fact2> are to be cut into pieces of all the same length without remainder. What is the greatest possible length of the pieces?

Answer: We need to find the greatest possible length of the pieces that can be cut from the wires. To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the two wires. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. We start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number, and then we replace the larger number with the remainder. We repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 448 and 616:

616 = 448 × 1 + 168
448 = 168 × 2 + 112
168 = 112 × 1 + 56
112 = 56 × 2 + 0

The last non-zero remainder is 56, so the GCD of 448 and 616 is 56.

Therefore, the greatest possible length of the pieces that can be cut from the wires is 56 cm."

Answer: To find the greatest possible length of each plank, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three lengths. This is because the GCD will be the longest length that can evenly divide all three lengths. 

First, we need to find the GCD of <fact1>42</fact1> and <fact2>49</fact2>. We can do this by finding the prime factors of each number. The prime factors of <fact1>42</fact1> are 2 * 3 * 7, and the prime factors of <fact2>49</fact2> are 7 * 7. The only common factor is 7, so the GCD of <fact1>42</fact1> and <fact2>49</fact2> is 7.

Next, we need to find the GCD of the result (7) and <fact3>63</fact3>. The prime factors of <fact3>63</fact3> are 3 * 3 * 7. The common factors are 7, so the GCD of 7 and <fact3>63</fact3> is 7.

Therefore, the greatest possible length of each plank is 7."
2087,Fabric is sold in stores from bolts that are 45 or 60 inches wide. What is the width of the widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric if each strip has the same width?,"Reformatted Question: Fabric is sold in stores from bolts that are <fact1>45</fact1> or <fact2>60</fact2> inches wide. What is the width of the widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric if each strip has the same width?

Answer: To find the width of the widest strips of fabric we can cut from either bolt, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of <fact1>45</fact1> and <fact2>60</fact2>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both <fact1>45</fact1> and <fact2>60</fact2> without leaving a remainder. 

The factors of <fact1>45</fact1> are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. The factors of <fact2>60</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. The greatest common factor of <fact1>45</fact1> and <fact2>60</fact2> is <fact3>15</fact3>. Therefore, the width of the widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric if each strip has the same width is <fact3>15</fact3> inches."
2088,"The parents are making sandwiches for the class picnic. They have 72 turkey slices, 48 cheese slices, and 96 tomato slices. What is the greatest number of sandwiches they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?","Reformatted Question: The parents are making sandwiches for the class picnic. They have <fact1>72 turkey slices</fact1>, <fact2>48 cheese slices</fact2>, and <fact3>96 tomato slices</fact3>. What is the greatest number of sandwiches they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?
Answer: The parents have <fact1>72 turkey slices</fact1>, <fact2>48 cheese slices</fact2>, and <fact3>96 tomato slices</fact3>. To find the greatest number of sandwiches they can make, we need to find the smallest number of slices among the three, because that will be the limiting factor. The smallest number of slices is <fact2>48</fact2>. Therefore, the greatest number of sandwiches they can make is <fact2>48</fact2>. The answer is {48}."
2089,Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?,"Reformatted Question: Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving <fact1>Cincinnati</fact1> at the same time. One is biking <fact2>840 miles</fact2> to <fact3>Boston</fact3>. The other is biking <fact4>440 miles</fact4> to <fact5>Atlanta</fact5>. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?

Answer: We need to find the greatest number of miles each can bike each day if they want to cover equal distances each day. To do that, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two distances. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. In this case, the two distances are <fact2>840 miles</fact2> and <fact4>440 miles</fact4>. 

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that for any two integers a and b, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. 

We can start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number. In this case, we can divide <fact2>840 miles</fact2> by <fact4>440 miles</fact4>. This gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 400. 

Next, we can divide the smaller number by the remainder. In this case, we can divide <fact4>440 miles</fact4> by 400. This gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 40. 

We can continue this process until the remainder is 0. In this case, the remainder is 0 when we divide 400 by 40. 

The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 40. This means that the greatest number of miles each can bike each day if they want to cover equal distances each day is 40 miles."
2090,A fruit salad made on a TV cooking program requires chunks of cantaloupe and honeydew. What is the greatest number of servings you can make using all of the fruit if you have 30 chunks of cantaloupe and 42 chunks of honeydew?,"Reformatted Question: A fruit salad made on a TV cooking program requires chunks of <fact1>cantaloupe</fact1> and <fact2>honeydew</fact2>. What is the greatest number of servings you can make using all of the fruit if you have <fact3>30 chunks of cantaloupe</fact3> and <fact4>42 chunks of honeydew</fact4>?

Answer: The greatest number of servings you can make will be limited by the ingredient that has fewer chunks. In this case, there are <fact3>30 chunks of cantaloupe</fact3> and <fact4>42 chunks of honeydew</fact4>. Since <fact3>30</fact3> is less than <fact4>42</fact4>, the number of servings will be determined by the number of chunks of cantaloupe. Therefore, the greatest number of servings you can make is <fact3>30</fact3>."

If she had to wash <fact2>two shirts</fact2> and <fact3>thirty-three sweaters</fact3>, how many loads would she have to do?

Answer: Haley's washing machine can only wash <fact1>seven pieces of clothing</fact1> at a time. To find out how many loads she needs to do, we need to know how many pieces of clothing she has to wash in total. She has to wash <fact2>two shirts</fact2> and <fact3>thirty-three sweaters</fact3>. That means she has <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>33</fact3> = 35 pieces of clothing in total. Since her washing machine can only wash <fact1>seven pieces of clothing</fact1> at a time, she will need to do <fact1>7</fact1> / <fact2>2</fact2> = 1.75 loads. However, since she can't do a fraction of a load, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she will need to do <fact1>2</fact1> loads."

She finished <fact2>forty-seven of them</fact2> but still had <fact3>seven pages of problems</fact3> to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?

Answer: Paige had <fact1>110 homework problems</fact1> in the beginning. She finished <fact2>47 of them</fact2>, so she still has <fact1>110</fact1> - <fact2>47</fact2> = 63 problems left.

This means that the total points scored by everyone else is <fact2>28</fact2> - <fact3>8</fact3> = 20 points. Since the total points scored by the team is <fact1>68</fact1>, the number of players on the team is <fact1>68</fact1> / <fact3>8</fact3> = 8.5.

If she used <fact3>5 cups of flour</fact3> on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
Answer: Isabel needed <fact2>5 brownies</fact2> for her party, but she only baked <fact1>3</fact1>. This means she still needs <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact1>3</fact1> = 2 brownies. Since each brownie requires <fact3>5 cups of flour</fact3>, she still needs 2 * <fact3>5</fact3> = 10 cups of flour. The answer is {10}."
2257,"At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?","Reformatted Question: At a restaurant each adult meal costs <fact1>$8</fact1> and <fact2>kids eat free</fact2>. If a group of <fact3>11 people</fact3> came in and <fact4>2 were kids</fact4>, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
Answer: We know that at the restaurant, each adult meal costs <fact1>$8</fact1>. We also know that <fact2>kids eat free</fact2>. The group has <fact3>11 people</fact3> and <fact4>2 are kids</fact4>, which means there are <fact3>11</fact3> - <fact4>2</fact4> = 9 adults. Since each adult meal costs <fact1>$8</fact1>, the cost for the adults will be <fact3>9</fact3> * <fact1>$8</fact1> = $72. The cost for the kids is 0 because <fact2>kids eat free</fact2>. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat is $72. The answer is {72}."

Scout Deborah sold <fact2>31 boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes</fact2>. How many boxes will not be packed to a case?
Answer: There are <fact1>12 boxes to a case</fact1>. Scout Deborah sold <fact2>31 boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes</fact2>. To determine how many boxes will not be packed, we need to find out how many boxes can be packed to a case and subtract that from the number of boxes she sold. Since there are <fact1>12 boxes to a case</fact1>, we can pack <fact1>12</fact1> boxes to a case. However, Scout Deborah sold <fact2>31 boxes</fact2>, which is more than the number of boxes that can be packed to a case. Therefore, the number of boxes that will not be packed to a case is the difference between the number of boxes sold and the number of boxes that can be packed to a case, which is <fact2>31</fact2> - <fact1>12</fact1> = 19 boxes."
2264,"Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?","Reformatted Question: Nancy sold <fact1>45 boxes of Tagalongs</fact1>. How many cases of <fact2>12 boxes</fact2>, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?
Answer: To find out how many cases of 12 boxes Nancy needs, we first need to divide the total number of boxes sold by the number of boxes in each case. <fact1>45 boxes</fact1> were sold, and each case contains <fact2>12 boxes</fact2>. So, we divide <fact1>45</fact1> by <fact2>12</fact2> to get the number of full cases. <fact1>45</fact1> ÷ <fact2>12</fact2> = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we round down to 3 full cases. This means Nancy needs 3 cases of 12 boxes. However, we still need to account for the extra boxes. To find the number of extra boxes, we multiply the number of full cases by the number of boxes in each case and subtract that from the total number of boxes sold. <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact2>12</fact2> = 36. Then, <fact1>45</fact1> - <fact2>36</fact2> = 9. So, Nancy needs 3 cases of 12 boxes, plus 9 extra boxes. The answer is {3, 9}."

Answer: Since Anne gave <fact2>equal numbers</fact2> of Sweettarts to her <fact3>3 friends</fact3>, each friend must have received the same number of Sweettarts. To find out how many Sweettarts each person ate, we need to divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of friends. The total number of Sweettarts is <fact1>15</fact1>, and the number of friends is <fact3>3</fact3>. So, each person ate <fact1>15</fact1> / <fact3>3</fact3> = 5 Sweettarts. The answer is {5}."

If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Sean had <fact1>45 Starbursts</fact1>. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his <fact2>18 friends</fact2> and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?

Answer: Sean had <fact1>45 Starbursts</fact1> initially. He gave <fact2>equal numbers</fact2> of Starbursts to his <fact2>18 friends</fact2>. This means he gave <fact2>18</fact2> * <fact2>1</fact2> (since they are equal) = <fact2>18</fact2> Starbursts to each friend. Since he gave <fact2>18</fact2> to each of his <fact2>18 friends</fact2>, he gave a total of <fact2>18</fact2> * <fact2>18</fact2> = <fact3>324</fact3> Starbursts to his friends. He had <fact1>45</fact1> in the beginning, so now he has <fact1>45</fact1> - <fact3>324</fact3> = <fact4>-279</fact4> Starbursts. However, since you can't have a negative number of Starbursts, this means that Sean ate <fact3>279</fact3> Starbursts. Since he ate <fact3>279</fact3> and he gave <fact2>18</fact2> to each of his <fact2>18 friends</fact2>, each person ate <fact3>279</fact3> / <fact2>18</fact2> = <fact5>15.5</fact5> Starbursts."

Answer: Matthew had <fact1>27 crackers</fact1> in total. He gave equal numbers of crackers to his <fact2>9 friends</fact2>. To find out how many crackers each person got, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends. So, we divide <fact1>27</fact1> by <fact2>9</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>27</fact1> ÷ <fact2>9</fact2> = 3. Therefore, each person ate 3 crackers. The answer is {3}."

Answer: To find out how many cases of 6 boxes Mary needs to deliver, we need to divide the total number of boxes she sold by 6. <fact1>9 boxes</fact1> divided by <fact2>6 boxes per case</fact2> is <fact1>9</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2> = 1.5 cases. Since we can't have half a case, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means Mary needs 2 cases of 6 boxes. However, she sold <fact1>9 boxes</fact1> and each case contains <fact2>6 boxes</fact2>, so she has <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact2>6 * 2</fact2> = 9 - 12 = -3 boxes left over. But since you can't have a negative number of boxes, this means Mary actually has 3 extra boxes that she needs to deliver. Therefore, Mary needs 2 cases of 6 boxes, plus 3 extra boxes. The answer is {2, 3}."
2269,"Samuel had 14 Skittles. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Samuel had <fact1>14 Skittles</fact1>. If Samuel gave <fact2>equal numbers of Skittles</fact2> to his <fact3>4 friends</fact3> and then he ate <fact4>what was left</fact4>, how many Skittles did each person eat?

Answer: Samuel initially had <fact1>14 Skittles</fact1>. He gave <fact2>equal numbers of Skittles</fact2> to his <fact3>4 friends</fact3>. This means he gave 14 / <fact3>4</fact3> = 3.5 Skittles to each friend. However, since you cannot divide Skittles into fractions, this means he gave 3 Skittles to each friend. After giving away 3 Skittles to each of the <fact3>4 friends</fact3>, he gave away a total of 3 * <fact3>4</fact3> = 12 Skittles. This means he had <fact1>14</fact1> - <fact5>12</fact5> = 2 Skittles left. He then ate <fact4>what was left</fact4>, which is 2 Skittles."
2270,"If Lillian split 20 Skittles between 8 people in her class and kept the left overs, how many Skittles did each classmate get?","Reformatted Question: If Lillian split <fact1>20 Skittles</fact1> between <fact2>8 people</fact2> in her class and kept the <fact3>left overs</fact3>, how many Skittles did each classmate get?
Answer: Since Lillian kept the <fact3>left overs</fact3>, she must have given away all the Skittles she had. She initially had <fact1>20 Skittles</fact1> and gave them to <fact2>8 people</fact2>. To find out how many Skittles each classmate got, we need to divide the total number of Skittles by the number of people.

Lemon heads come in <fact3>packages of 3</fact3>. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?
Answer: Since Lemon heads come in <fact3>packages of 3</fact3>, Patricia must have had <fact3>3</fact3> * some number of packages. If she ate <fact2>15 Lemon Heads</fact2>, then she must have had at least <fact2>15</fact2> / <fact3>3</fact3> = 5 packages. This is because she must have had enough packages to have at least 15 Lemon Heads. Now that she has eaten 15 Lemon Heads, she must have <fact3>3</fact3> * some number of packages left. Since she had 5 packages initially, she must have <fact3>3</fact3> * 5 = 15 Lemon Heads left."
2272,Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Crackers come in packages of <fact1>18</fact1>. Betty ate <fact2>45</fact2> crackers. How many crackers does she have left?
Answer: Betty bought crackers in packages of <fact1>18</fact1>. Since she ate <fact2>45</fact2> crackers, she must have bought <fact2>45</fact2> / <fact1>18</fact1> = 2.5 packages. Since you can't buy half a package, she must have bought 3 packages. In 3 packages, there are <fact1>18</fact1> * 3 = 54 crackers. She ate <fact2>45</fact2> crackers, so she has 54 - <fact2>45</fact2> = 9 crackers left. The answer is {9}."

Answer: We know that Skittles come in <fact1>packages of 6</fact1>. Since Juan ate <fact2>24 Skittles</fact2>, we can find out how many packages he ate by dividing <fact2>24</fact2> by <fact1>6</fact1>. However, since we are asked to find out how many Skittles he has left, we can also find out how many Skittles are in <fact2>24</fact2> by dividing <fact2>24</fact2> by <fact1>6</fact1>. We know that the remainder of the division will tell us how many Skittles he has left. 

We can find the remainder of the division of <fact2>24</fact2> by <fact1>6</fact1> by doing the division: <fact2>24</fact2> ÷ <fact1>6</fact1> = 4. The remainder of this division is 0. However, this means that he ate 4 packages of Skittles. Since the remainder is 0, this means that he ate 4 packages of 6 Skittles each, which is a total of 4 * 6 = 24 Skittles. This is the same number of Skittles he ate, which means that he ate all the Skittles. Therefore, he has 0 Skittles left."

How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Barbara has eaten <fact1>59 Atomic Fireballs</fact1>. Atomic fireballs come in packages of <fact2>9</fact2>. How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?
Answer: Atomic fireballs come in packages of <fact2>9</fact2>. Barbara ate <fact1>59 Atomic Fireballs</fact1>. To find out how many packages she ate, we need to divide <fact1>59</fact1> by <fact2>9</fact2>. Since <fact1>59</fact1> is not exactly divisible by <fact2>9</fact2>, we will have a remainder. To find the remainder, we can use the modulo operator. The remainder of <fact1>59</fact1> divided by <fact2>9</fact2> is <fact3>59 mod 9 = 4</fact3>. This means Barbara ate <fact3>4</fact3> Atomic Fireballs as a remainder. Since each package has <fact2>9</fact2> Atomic Fireballs, the number of packages she ate is <fact3>59 - 4 = 55</fact3> divided by <fact2>9</fact2>, which is <fact3>55 / 9 = 6</fact3> with a remainder of <fact3>1</fact3>. This means she ate <fact3>6</fact3> packages and had <fact3>1</fact3> package left. Since each package has <fact2>9</fact2> Atomic Fireballs, she has <fact3>1</fact3> * <fact2>9</fact2> = <fact4>9</fact4> Atomic Fireballs left. The answer is {9}."
