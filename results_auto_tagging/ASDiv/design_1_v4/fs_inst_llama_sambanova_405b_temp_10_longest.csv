Answer: We know that Olivia had <fact1>$8</fact1> after buying bagels. Later she had <fact3>$69.00</fact3> before buying cookies and juice. This means she must have gotten some money in between. We don't know how she got it, but we know she had <fact3>$69.00</fact3> before buying cookies and juice. After buying cookies, she had <fact2>$50.00 left</fact2> before buying juice.

Simon, an adventurer, got trapped in the magical Blackwood Forest. In order to find the way out, he needs to solve a series of puzzles. The first puzzle involved two giant trees. To open the path, he needs to find the height difference between the two trees. If the <fact1>first tree is 465 ft high</fact1> and the <fact2>second is 399 ft</fact2>, what is the height difference?

Answer: 
We are given the heights of two trees. The <fact1>first tree is 465 ft high</fact1> and the <fact2>second is 399 ft</fact2>. To find the height difference, we need to subtract the height of the second tree from the height of the first tree. So, the height difference is <fact1>465</fact1> - <fact2>399</fact2> = 66 ft. The answer is {66}."
321,"The path opened to a beautiful garden enclosed by a wall. The exit door will open when the number of white flowers is the same as the number of red flowers.

The exit door will open when the number of <fact1>white flowers</fact1> is the same as the number of <fact2>red flowers</fact2>. If there are <fact3>555 white flowers</fact3> and <fact4>347 red flowers</fact4>, how many more <fact2>red flowers</fact2> are needed?

Answer: We start with <fact3>555 white flowers</fact3> and <fact4>347 red flowers</fact4>. To have the same number of <fact1>white flowers</fact1> and <fact2>red flowers</fact2>, the number of <fact2>red flowers</fact2> should be equal to the number of <fact1>white flowers</fact1>. The difference between the number of <fact1>white flowers</fact1> and the number of <fact2>red flowers</fact2> is <fact3>555</fact3> - <fact4>347</fact4> = 208.

If they spent <fact2>$268.00 on food</fact2> and <fact3>$118.00 on utensils and other stuff</fact3>, how much did they spend on drinks?

Her first destination was in an island of statues which is <fact1>436 miles</fact1> from her place. She took a plane that made two stopovers, the 1st stopover after covering <fact2>132 miles</fact2> and the 2nd stopover after another <fact3>236 miles</fact3>. How much farther is the island from the 2nd stopover?

Answer: To find out how much farther the island is from the 2nd stopover, we need to first find out how far the plane has traveled so far. The plane traveled <fact2>132 miles</fact2> to the 1st stopover and then another <fact3>236 miles</fact3> to the 2nd stopover. So, the total distance traveled is <fact2>132</fact2> + <fact3>236</fact3> = 368 miles. Since the island is <fact1>436 miles</fact1> from the starting point, the distance from the 2nd stopover to the island is <fact1>436</fact1> - 368 = 68 miles. The answer is {68}."

498,"Joe, Susie's brother, collected all 94 trading cards scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, how many boxes were fully filled?","Reformatted Question: Joe, Susie's brother, collected all <fact1>94 trading cards</fact1> scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of <fact2>8 cards</fact2>, how many boxes were fully filled?

Answer: To find out how many boxes were fully filled, we need to divide the total number of cards by the number of cards a full box can hold. The total number of cards is <fact1>94 trading cards</fact1> and a full box can hold <fact2>8 cards</fact2>. So, we divide <fact1>94</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2> to get 11.75. Since a box can't be partially filled in this context, we take the whole number part, which is 11. However, to see if there are enough cards to fully fill 11 boxes, we multiply 11 by <fact2>8 cards</fact2> to get 88 cards. We then subtract 88 from <fact1>94</fact1> to get 6 cards left. Since 6 cards are not enough to fill a box that can hold <fact2>8 cards</fact2>, the answer remains 11 boxes. The answer is {11}."
499,"Joe, Susie's brother, collected all 94 trading cards scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, how many cards are there in the unfilled box?","Reformatted Question: Joe, Susie's brother, collected all <fact1>94 trading cards</fact1> scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of <fact2>8 cards</fact2>, how many cards are there in the unfilled box?

Answer: To find out how many cards are in the unfilled box, we need to first find out how many full boxes there are. We can do this by dividing the total number of cards, which is <fact1>94 trading cards</fact1>, by the number of cards that can fit in a full box, which is <fact2>8 cards</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>94</fact1> / <fact2>8</fact2> = 11.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, this means we have 11 full boxes and 1 unfilled box. To find out how many cards are in the unfilled box, we can multiply the number of full boxes by the number of cards in a full box, then subtract this from the total number of cards. This gives us 11 * <fact2>8</fact2> = 88 cards in the full boxes. Subtracting this from the total number of cards gives us <fact1>94</fact1> - 88 = 6 cards in the unfilled box. The answer is {6}."

If the <fact2>34 stars</fact2> that they made were to be distributed equally to the <fact1>cans of paint</fact1>, how many stars will be left unpainted?

Answer: To find out how many stars each can of paint will get, we need to divide the total number of stars by the number of cans. So, we divide <fact2>34 stars</fact2> by <fact1>4 cans of paint</fact1>, which gives us 34 / 4 = 8.5 stars per can. Since we can't distribute a fraction of a star, each can will get 8 stars. Now, we need to find out how many stars will be left unpainted. We can do this by subtracting the total number of stars that will be painted (8 stars per can * <fact1>4 cans</fact1> = 32 stars) from the total number of stars (<fact2>34 stars</fact2>). This gives us <fact2>34</fact2> - 32 = 2 stars that will be left unpainted. The answer is {2}."

Answer: To find out how many croissants Cristina will have left, we need to first find out how many croissants each guest will get. Since Cristina has <fact2>seven guests</fact2> and they are served equally, we divide the total number of <fact1>croissants</fact1> by the number of guests. This means each guest will get <fact1>17</fact1> / <fact2>7</fact2> = 2.4285714286 ( rounded to 2 decimal places), but since we can't divide croissants into fractions, we round down to 2 croissants per guest.

516,"Instead of buying from the store, Melody made Christmas cards for the elderly in a nursing home. She had 99 blue sequins which she plans to use as snowflakes for the cards. If she distributes the sequins equally to 12 cards, how many sequins will Melody have left?","Reformatted Question: Instead of buying from the store, Melody made Christmas cards for the elderly in a nursing home. She had <fact1>99 blue sequins</fact1> which she plans to use as snowflakes for the cards. If she distributes the sequins equally to <fact2>12 cards</fact2>, how many sequins will Melody have left?

Answer: To find out how many sequins Melody will have left, we need to first find out how many sequins she will use. Since she distributes the sequins equally to <fact2>12 cards</fact2>, we need to divide the total number of sequins by 12. <fact1>99 blue sequins</fact1> / <fact2>12 cards</fact2> = 8.25 sequins per card. Since we can't have a fraction of a sequin, we round down to 8 sequins per card. This means Melody will use 8 * <fact2>12 cards</fact2> = 96 sequins. She had <fact1>99 blue sequins</fact1> in the beginning, so now she has <fact1>99</fact1> - 96 = 3 sequins left. The answer is {3}."

How many mistletoe stickers will she have left?,"Reformatted Question: She had <fact1>35 mistletoe stickers</fact1> and wanted to place them equally in <fact2>8 cards</fact2>. How many mistletoe stickers will she have left?

Answer: To find out how many stickers she can put in each card, we need to divide the total number of stickers by the number of cards. This means we divide <fact1>35 stickers</fact1> by <fact2>8 cards</fact2>, which is 35 / 8 = 4.375. Since we can't divide stickers, we'll round down to 4 stickers per card. Now, we multiply the number of cards by the number of stickers per card to find out how many stickers she used: <fact2>8 cards</fact2> * 4 stickers/card = 32 stickers. She had <fact1>35 stickers</fact1> initially, so to find out how many are left, we subtract the number of stickers used from the total: <fact1>35</fact1> - 32 = 3 stickers. The answer is {3}."

Answer: Melody had <fact1>26 cut-outs of Christmas trees</fact1> initially. She pasted <fact2>4 of this</fact2> on cards. To find out how many cut-outs she has left, we need to subtract the number of cut-outs she pasted from the total number of cut-outs she had. However, the question does not specify how many sets of <fact2>4 cut-outs</fact2> Melody pasted. Since it is mentioned that she pasted <fact2>4 of this</fact2> to the front cover of a certain number of cards, we can assume that she pasted <fact2>4 cut-outs</fact2> in total. In this case, she would have <fact1>26</fact1> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 22 cut-outs left."

There are <fact3>7 seats</fact3>. How many seats will have <fact4>3 children</fact4> seated on them?

Answer: Since there are <fact3>7 seats</fact3> and the children can sit <fact2>2 or 3 to a seat</fact2>, we can start by assuming all seats have 2 children. This would mean there are <fact3>7</fact3> * 2 = 14 children. However, we have <fact1>19 children</fact1>, so the remaining <fact1>19</fact1> - 14 = 5 children must be seated in seats with <fact4>3 children</fact4>. Since each of these seats already has 2 children, the 5 remaining children will fill 5 / (3-2) = 5 seats to make them have <fact4>3 children</fact4>. The answer is {5}."

Answer: To find out how many pencils were donated to the library, we need to find out how many pencils were given to the classrooms. Since the pencils are divided evenly among <fact2>9 classrooms</fact2>, we divide the total number of pencils, <fact1>935 pencils</fact1>, by <fact2>9</fact2> to get the number of pencils per classroom. 935 / 9 = 103.888... Since we can't divide pencils into fractions, we round down to 103 pencils per classroom. Now, we multiply the number of pencils per classroom by the number of classrooms to get the total number of pencils given to the classrooms. 103 * <fact2>9</fact2> = 927 pencils. The rest of the pencils are given to the library, so we subtract the number of pencils given to the classrooms from the total number of pencils. <fact1>935</fact1> - 927 = 8 pencils.

As they were deciding what to buy, <fact1>24 girls came in</fact1> and <fact2>31 boys left</fact2>. If there are <fact3>78 children in the bakery in the end</fact3>, how many children were there at first?

Answer: We know that in the end there are <fact3>78 children</fact3>. We also know that <fact1>24 girls came in</fact1> and <fact2>31 boys left</fact2>. To find the original number of children, we need to subtract the number of girls that came in and add the number of boys that left from the final number of children. However, since the girls came in, this would be an addition in the equation and the boys leaving would be a subtraction. So the correct calculation would be: original number = final number - (girls that came in) + (boys that left). original number = <fact3>78</fact3> - <fact1>24</fact1> + <fact2>31</fact2> = 85.

Answer: We know that Blithe ended up with <fact3>43 toys</fact3>. Before that, he had <fact2>found 9 toys</fact2> and <fact1>lost 6 toys</fact1>. Let's undo these events. If he had <fact2>not found the 9 toys</fact2>, he would have had <fact3>43</fact3> - <fact2>9</fact2> = 34 toys. If he had also <fact1>not lost the 6 toys</fact1>, he would have had 34 + <fact1>6</fact1> = 40 toys. This means that Blithe had 40 toys at first. The answer is {40}."

Answer: We know that Lena had <fact4>$66</fact4> after losing <fact2>$4</fact2> and getting <fact3>$9</fact3> from her mom. To find out how much she had before her mom gave her money, we need to subtract the money her mom gave her, so we have <fact4>$66</fact4> - <fact3>$9</fact3> = $57. This is the amount of money she had after losing <fact2>$4</fact2>. To find out how much she had at first, we need to add the money she lost, so we have $57 + <fact2>$4</fact2> = $61.

At a bus stop, <fact1>7 more passengers got on the bus</fact1> and <fact2>9 passengers got off</fact2>. If there are <fact3>26 passengers in the bus in the end</fact3>, how many passengers were there at first?

Answer: We know that in the end, there are <fact3>26 passengers</fact3>. To find out how many were there at first, we need to undo the changes that happened at the bus stop. Since <fact1>7 passengers got on</fact1>, we need to subtract 7 from the final count to undo this change. However, since <fact2>9 passengers got off</fact2>, we need to add 9 to the final count to undo this change. So, to undo both changes, we need to subtract 7 and add 9, which is the same as adding 2. Therefore, the initial number of passengers is <fact3>26</fact3> - <fact1>7</fact1> + <fact2>9</fact2> = <fact3>26</fact3> + 2 = 28, or more simply, <fact3>26</fact3> + <fact2>9</fact2> - <fact1>7</fact1> = 28.

He lost <fact2>4 of them</fact2> and his dad gave him <fact3>10 more books</fact3>. If he had <fact4>39 books after that</fact4>, how many books did Bruno have at first?

Answer: Let's denote the number of books Bruno had at first as x. We know that he lost <fact2>4 books</fact2> and then got <fact3>10 more books</fact3>. So, after these two events, he had x - <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>10</fact3> books. We are also told that after these events, he had <fact4>39 books</fact4>. This means x - <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>10</fact3> = <fact4>39</fact4>. We can simplify this equation to x + 6 = <fact4>39</fact4>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact4>39</fact4> - 6 = 33.

Answer: We know that there are <fact1>95 colored lights</fact1> in total. Out of these, <fact2>26 are red</fact2> and <fact3>37 are yellow</fact3>.

Since there are <fact1>56 students</fact1> in total and the first group has <fact2>24 students</fact2>, the second group must have <fact1>56</fact1> - <fact2>24</fact2> = 32 students. To find out how many more students are in the second group compared to the first group, we need to subtract the number of students in the first group from the number of students in the second group. So, 32 - <fact2>24</fact2> = 8. The answer is {8}."

If there are <fact2>200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day</fact2>, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?

Answer: To find out how many washing machines are needed, we divide the total amount of clothes to be washed, which is <fact2>200 pounds</fact2>, by the capacity of one washing machine, which is <fact1>28 pounds per day</fact1>. This gives us <fact2>200</fact2> / <fact1>28</fact1> = 7.14. Since we can't have a fraction of a washing machine, this means we need 8 washing machines to wash all the clothes. However, the question asks about the washing machine that isn't fully loaded. Since 7 washing machines can wash 7 * <fact1>28</fact1> = 196 pounds of clothes, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded will wash the remaining <fact2>200</fact2> - 196 = 4 pounds of clothes.

If each bag has a <fact2>capacity of 65 pounds</fact2>, how many pounds of sand are there in the bag that is not full?

Answer: To find out how many bags can be filled completely, we need to divide the total amount of sand (<fact1>757 pounds</fact1>) by the capacity of each bag (<fact2>65 pounds</fact2>). This gives us <fact1>757</fact1> / <fact2>65</fact2> = 11.64. Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, this means we can fill 11 bags completely, and the 12th bag will be partially filled. To find out how much sand is in the partially filled bag, we need to subtract the amount of sand in the 11 full bags from the total amount of sand. 11 full bags contain 11 * <fact2>65</fact2> = 715 pounds of sand. Subtracting this from the total amount of sand gives us <fact1>757</fact1> - 715 = 42 pounds of sand in the bag that is not full. The answer is {42}."

So, the number of days he needs is <fact1>519</fact1> / <fact2>42</fact2> = 12.36 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Simon needs 13 days to finish making all the gift boxes. The answer is {13}."

Answer: To find out how many gift bags Simon will make on the last day, we first need to find out how many days it will take him to make all the gift bags. We can do this by dividing the total number of gift bags <fact1>519</fact1> by the number of gift bags he makes per day <fact2>42</fact2>. 

519 / 42 = 12.357. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means Simon will make gift bags for 12 days and then make the remaining gift bags on the 13th day. 

To find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day, we need to find out how many gift bags he made in the first 12 days. 

12 * <fact2>42</fact2> = 504 gift bags. 

Then we subtract this from the total number of gift bags <fact1>519</fact1> to find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day.

If there are <fact2>248 vases of flowers</fact2> to be arranged, how many vases of flowers will she arrange on the last day?

Answer: To find out how many vases of flowers Jane will arrange on the last day, we need to first find out how many days it will take her to arrange all the vases. We can do this by dividing the total number of vases, <fact2>248 vases of flowers</fact2>, by the number of vases she can arrange in a day, <fact1>16 vases of flowers</fact1>. 

248 / 16 = 15.5. 

Since Jane can't arrange a fraction of a vase, this means she will arrange vases for 15 days and then arrange the remaining vases on the 16th day. 

To find out how many vases she will arrange on the last day, we need to find out how many vases are left after 15 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of vases she can arrange in a day, <fact1>16 vases of flowers</fact1>, by the number of days, 15. 

16 * 15 = 240

Then, we subtract this number from the total number of vases, <fact2>248 vases of flowers</fact2>. 

248 - 240 = 8

So, Jane will arrange 8 vases of flowers on the last day. The answer is {8}."

If there are <fact2>3,484 pieces of chalk</fact2>, how many chalks are there in the box that is not full?

Answer: To find out how many boxes are full, we need to divide the total number of chalks, which is <fact2>3,484</fact2>, by the number of chalks a box can hold, which is <fact1>18</fact1>. This gives us <fact2>3,484</fact2> / <fact1>18</fact1> = 193.555. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, this means we have 193 full boxes and 1 box that is not full. To find out how many chalks are in the box that is not full, we need to find the remainder of the division. We can do this by multiplying the number of full boxes by the number of chalks a box can hold, which is 193 * <fact1>18</fact1> = 3,474, and then subtracting this from the total number of chalks, which is <fact2>3,484</fact2>.

Answer: To find out how many cookies are in the paper bag that is not full, we first need to find out how many full paper bags Edgar can fill with the cookies he bought. Since each paper bag can hold <fact1>16 cookies</fact1>, we divide the total number of cookies Edgar bought, which is <fact2>292 cookies</fact2>, by the number of cookies each bag can hold, which is <fact1>16 cookies</fact1>. 

<fact2>292</fact2> / <fact1>16</fact1> = 18.25. This means Edgar can fill 18 full paper bags with the cookies he bought, and he will have some cookies left over for a 19th bag that will not be full. To find out how many cookies are in the 19th bag, we multiply the number of full bags by the number of cookies each bag can hold, then subtract that from the total number of cookies Edgar bought.

18 * <fact1>16</fact1> = 288. 
<fact2>292</fact2> - 288 = 4.

If a school of <fact2>1,230 students and teachers</fact2> are going on a field trip, how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?

Answer: To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of students and teachers by the capacity of the bus. So, we divide <fact2>1,230 students and teachers</fact2> by <fact1>48 passengers</fact1> per bus. 1230 / 48 = 25.625. This means we need 26 buses to transport everyone, but the last bus will not be fully occupied. To find out how many passengers are on the last bus, we multiply the number of full buses (25) by the capacity of the bus (<fact1>48 passengers</fact1>), then subtract this from the total number of students and teachers (<fact2>1,230 students and teachers</fact2>). 25 * <fact1>48</fact1> = 1200. <fact2>1230</fact2> - 1200 = 30.

Answer: To find out how many watches Tom will fix on the last day, we need to first find out how many days it will take him to fix all the watches. We can do this by dividing the total number of watches <fact1>158 watches</fact1> by the number of watches he fixes per day <fact2>12 watches per day</fact2>. 

158 / 12 = 13.17. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means Tom will fix watches for 13 days and then fix the remaining watches on the 14th day. 

Now, we need to find out how many watches he will fix on the 14th day. We can do this by finding out how many watches he will have fixed in 13 days. 

13 * <fact2>12 watches per day</fact2> = 156 watches.

If he reads <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>, how many days will he take to finish reading the <fact1>book</fact1>?

Answer: To find out how many days Jack will take to finish reading the <fact1>book</fact1>, we need to divide the total number of pages in the <fact1>book</fact1> by the number of pages he reads per day. The total number of pages in the <fact1>book</fact1> is <fact1>285 pages</fact1>, and he reads <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>. So, the number of days he will take to finish reading the <fact1>book</fact1> is <fact1>285 pages</fact1> / <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2> = 12.39 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. The answer is {13}."
770,"Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many pages will he read on the last day?","Reformatted Question: Jack is reading a <fact1>285-page book</fact1>. If he reads <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>, how many pages will he read on the last day?

Answer: To find out how many pages Jack will read on the last day, we need to first find out how many days it will take him to finish the book. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages in the book, which is <fact1>285 pages</fact1>, by the number of pages he reads per day, which is <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>. 

So, <fact1>285 pages</fact1> / <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2> = 12.3913 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means Jack will finish the book on the 13th day.

Now, we need to find out how many pages Jack will have read in 12 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of pages he reads per day, which is <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2>, by the number of days, which is 12. 

So, <fact2>23 pages per day</fact2> * 12 days = 276 pages. 

This means that on the last day, Jack will have <fact1>285 pages</fact1> - 276 pages = 9 pages left to read. The answer is {9}."

If a company bought <fact2>728 gallons</fact2> of oil, how many tanks are needed to hold all the oil?

Answer: To find out how many tanks are needed, we need to divide the total amount of oil by the capacity of each tank. The total amount of oil is <fact2>728 gallons</fact2> and the capacity of each tank is <fact1>32 gallons</fact1>. So, we divide <fact2>728</fact2> by <fact1>32</fact1> to get the number of tanks needed. <fact2>728</fact2> / <fact1>32</fact1> = 22.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a tank, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 23 tanks are needed to hold all the oil. The answer is {23}."
772,"The capacity of a tank is 32 gallons. If a company bought 728 gallons of oil, how much oil is in the tank that is not full?","Reformatted Question: The capacity of a tank is <fact1>32 gallons</fact1>. If a company bought <fact2>728 gallons</fact2> of oil, how much oil is in the tank that is not full?

Answer: To find out how much oil is in the tank that is not full, we need to divide the total amount of oil bought by the capacity of the tank. The total amount of oil bought is <fact2>728 gallons</fact2> and the capacity of the tank is <fact1>32 gallons</fact1>. So, we divide <fact2>728</fact2> by <fact1>32</fact1> to get 22.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a tank, this means that 22 tanks will be full and 1 tank will not be full. To find out how much oil is in the tank that is not full, we subtract 22 * <fact1>32</fact1> from <fact2>728</fact2>. 22 * <fact1>32</fact1> is 704. So, <fact2>728</fact2> - 704 is 24.

Answer: To find out how many strawberries each girl got, we need to divide the total number of strawberries by the number of girls. Since Mrs. Smith gave <fact1>53 strawberries</fact1> to <fact2>8 girls</fact2>, we divide <fact1>53</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2>. This gives us 53 / 8 = 6.625. Since we can't divide strawberries into fractions, we can round down to 6 strawberries per girl, with 5 strawberries left over. However, the question implies an equal distribution, so we can assume the extra strawberries are either kept by Mrs. Smith or distributed in some other way not specified in the question. For the purpose of this calculation, we'll focus on the whole number result, which is 6 strawberries per girl, with the understanding that there are some strawberries left over."
774,Mrs. Smith gave 53 strawberries to 8 girls equally. How many strawberries were left?,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Smith gave <fact1>53 strawberries</fact1> to <fact2>8 girls</fact2> equally. How many strawberries were left?

Answer: To find out how many strawberries were left, we first need to find out how many strawberries each girl got. Since Mrs. Smith gave the strawberries to the <fact2>8 girls</fact2> equally, we divide the total number of strawberries, which is <fact1>53 strawberries</fact1>, by the number of girls, which is <fact2>8</fact2>. This gives us 53 / 8 = 6.625. Since we can't divide strawberries into fractions, we round down to 6 strawberries per girl, and then multiply the number of girls by this number to find the total number of strawberries given: <fact2>8</fact2> * 6 = 48 strawberries. Now, we subtract the number of strawberries given from the total number of strawberries to find the number of strawberries left: <fact1>53</fact1> - 48 = 5 strawberries. The answer is {5}."

Answer: Tom has <fact1>$19</fact1> to spend. Each folder costs <fact2>$2</fact2>. To find out how many folders he can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has by the cost of each folder. So, he can buy <fact1>$19</fact1> / <fact2>$2</fact2> = 9.5 folders. Since you can't buy half a folder, Tom can buy 9 folders. The answer is {9}."
776,"Tom had $19 and he wanted to buy as many folders as he could. If one folder costs $2, how much is left after he bought the folders?","Reformatted Question: Tom had <fact1>$19</fact1> and he wanted to buy as many folders as he could. If one folder costs <fact2>$2</fact2>, how much is left after he bought the folders?

Answer: To find out how many folders Tom can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has by the cost of one folder. So, he can buy <fact1>$19</fact1> / <fact2>$2</fact2> = 9.5 folders. Since we can't buy half a folder, Tom can only buy 9 folders. Now, we need to find out how much he spent on the folders. He bought 9 folders for <fact2>$2</fact2> each, so he spent 9 * <fact2>$2</fact2> = $18. Tom had <fact1>$19</fact1> initially, so now he has <fact1>$19</fact1> - $18 = $1 left. The answer is {1}."

Answer: To find out how many <fact2>school-buses</fact2> are needed, we need to divide the total number of <fact1>86 students</fact1> by the number of students each <fact2>school-bus can take</fact2>, which is 9. So, we divide <fact1>86</fact1> by 9. 86 / 9 = 9.555. Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all students can go hiking. Therefore, we need 10 <fact2>school-buses</fact2>. The answer is {10}."
778,86 students are going hiking. Each school- bus can take 9 students. How many students are left?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>86 students</fact1> are going hiking. Each <fact2>school-bus can take 9 students</fact2>. How many students are left?

Answer: To find out how many students are left, we need to divide the total number of students (<fact1>86 students</fact1>) by the number of students each bus can take (<fact2>9 students</fact2>). This will give us the number of buses needed and the remainder will be the number of students left. 

So, we divide <fact1>86</fact1> by <fact2>9</fact2>, which gives us 9 with a remainder of 5. This means that 9 buses are needed to take 81 students (9 * 9 = 81), and there are 5 students left.

Answer: To find out how many pencils each student got, we need to divide the total number of pencils given by the teacher, which is <fact1>42 pencils</fact1>, by the number of students, which is <fact2>12 students</fact2>. So, each student got <fact1>42</fact1> / <fact2>12</fact2> = 3.5 pencils. The answer is {3.5}."
780,The teacher gave 42 pencils to 12 students equally. How many pencils are left?,"Reformatted Question: The teacher gave <fact1>42 pencils</fact1> to <fact2>12 students</fact2> equally. How many pencils are left?

Answer: To find out how many pencils are left, we need to first determine how many pencils each student received. Since the pencils were given equally, we can divide the total number of pencils <fact1>42 pencils</fact1> by the number of students <fact2>12 students</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>42</fact1> / <fact2>12</fact2> = 3.5 pencils per student. However, since pencils cannot be divided, we can assume that each student received 3 pencils and the remaining pencils were left. To find the remaining pencils, we can multiply the number of students <fact2>12 students</fact2> by the number of pencils each student received (3) and subtract this from the total number of pencils <fact1>42 pencils</fact1>. This gives us <fact1>42</fact1> - (<fact2>12</fact2> * 3) = <fact1>42</fact1> - 36 = 6 pencils. The answer is {6}."
781,"9 boys went to water trees. There were 29 trees. If each of them watered the equal amount of trees, how many trees did each boy water?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>9 boys</fact1> went to water trees. There were <fact2>29 trees</fact2>. If each of them watered the equal amount of trees, how many trees did each boy water?

Answer: There are <fact2>29 trees</fact2> and <fact1>9 boys</fact1> to water them. If each boy waters an equal number of trees, then we can divide the total number of trees by the number of boys to find out how many trees each boy watered. So, each boy watered <fact2>29</fact2> / <fact1>9</fact1> = 3.22 trees. Since you can't water a fraction of a tree, we can round down to 3 trees per boy, but this would mean that 2 trees are left unwatered (29 - 27 = 2), so it is more likely that some boys watered 3 trees and some boys watered 4 trees (8 * 3 + 1 * 4 = 28, or other combinations), but if we had to give an approximate number of trees each boy watered, it would be 3.22."
782,"9 boys went to water trees. There were 29 trees. If each of them watered the equal amount of trees, how many trees are left?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>9 boys</fact1> went to water trees. There were <fact2>29 trees</fact2>. If each of them watered the equal amount of trees, how many trees are left?

Answer: Since <fact1>9 boys</fact1> watered an equal number of trees, we can divide the total number of trees by the number of boys to find out how many trees each boy watered. However, the question asks how many trees are left. Since the question implies that the trees were watered, not removed or added, we can assume that the number of trees remains the same.

The total number of dogs is <fact1>22 dogs</fact1> and the number of dog-houses is <fact2>5 dog-houses</fact2>. So, the number of dogs in each dog-house is <fact1>22</fact1> / <fact2>5</fact2> = 4.4 dogs. The answer is {4.4}."
786,There are 22 dogs in the farm. They live in 5 dog-houses equally. How many dogs are left?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>22 dogs</fact1> in the farm. They live in <fact2>5 dog-houses</fact2> equally. How many dogs are left?

Answer: Since the <fact1>22 dogs</fact1> are spread equally across the <fact2>5 dog-houses</fact2>, we can find out how many dogs are in each dog-house by dividing the total number of dogs by the number of dog-houses. This means each dog-house has <fact1>22</fact1> / <fact2>5</fact2> = 4.4 dogs. However, since we can't have a fraction of a dog, this means the dogs can't be spread perfectly equally across the dog-houses. But to answer the question, we can round down to 4 dogs per dog-house, which means 4 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 20 dogs are in the dog-houses. To find out how many dogs are left, we subtract the number of dogs in the dog-houses from the total number of dogs. So, <fact1>22</fact1> - 20 = 2 dogs are left. The answer is {2}."

Answer: To find out how many basketballs are left, we need to first find out how many basketballs were distributed to the classes. Since the basketballs were distributed equally, we can divide the total number of basketballs <fact1>54</fact1> by the number of classes <fact2>7</fact2> to get the number of basketballs per class. 

<fact1>54</fact1> / <fact2>7</fact2> = 7.71 (round down to 7 since we can't distribute a fraction of a basketball)

So each class got 7 basketballs. Now we can find out how many basketballs were distributed in total by multiplying the number of classes <fact2>7</fact2> by the number of basketballs per class.

<fact2>7</fact2> * 7 = 49

This means 49 basketballs were distributed. To find out how many basketballs are left, we subtract the number of basketballs distributed from the total number of basketballs <fact1>54</fact1>.

A <fact2>large barrel</fact2> can hold <fact3>6 tons of oil</fact3> and a <fact4>small barrel</fact4> can hold <fact5>5 tons of oil</fact5>. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many <fact2>large barrels</fact2> should be used?

Answer: To use the least number of barrels, we should use as many <fact2>large barrels</fact2> as possible. We can calculate the number of <fact2>large barrels</fact2> by dividing the total amount of oil (<fact1>95 tons</fact1>) by the capacity of a <fact2>large barrel</fact2> (<fact3>6 tons</fact3>). 95 / 6 = 15.83. Since we can't have a fraction of a barrel, we can use 15 <fact2>large barrels</fact2>, which will hold 15 * <fact3>6 tons</fact3> = 90 tons of oil. The remaining  <fact1>95 tons</fact1> - 90 tons = 5 tons can be held by a <fact4>small barrel</fact4>. Therefore, we should use 15 <fact2>large barrels</fact2>. The answer is {15}."

In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many <fact3>small barrels</fact3> should be used?

Answer: To use the least number of barrels, we should use as many <fact2>large barrels</fact2> as possible. We can calculate the number of <fact2>large barrels</fact2> by dividing the total amount of oil (<fact1>95 tons</fact1>) by the capacity of a <fact2>large barrel (6 tons)</fact2>. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a barrel, we will divide and take the floor of the result: floor(<fact1>95</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2>) = floor(15.83) = 15. This means we can use 15 <fact2>large barrels</fact2>, which will hold 15 * <fact2>6</fact2> = 90 tons of oil.

Now, we need to find out how many <fact3>small barrels</fact3> are needed to hold the remaining oil. The remaining oil is <fact1>95</fact1> - 90 = 5 tons. Since a <fact3>small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil</fact3>, we need 1 <fact3>small barrel</fact3> to hold the remaining oil.

Therefore, to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, 1 <fact3>small barrel</fact3> should be used. The answer is {1}."

Answer: There are <fact2>122 portfolios of paintings</fact2> to be split among <fact1>15 students</fact1>. To find out how many portfolios each student will get, we need to divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students. So, each student will get <fact2>122</fact2> / <fact1>15</fact1> = 8.13 portfolios. Since we can't split a portfolio, we can round down to 8 portfolios per student. The answer is {8}."
798,15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will be left?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>15 students</fact1> split <fact2>122 portfolios of paintings</fact2>. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will be left?

Answer: To find out how many portfolios of paintings will be left, we need to divide the total number of portfolios, which is <fact2>122</fact2>, by the number of students, which is <fact1>15</fact1>. This will give us the number of portfolios each student gets. Since we want to know how many portfolios are left, we are interested in the remainder of this division. 

<fact2>122</fact2> / <fact1>15</fact1> = 8 remainder 2. 

This means that after dividing the portfolios among the students, 2 portfolios will be left. The answer is {2}."
799,172 students are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have 18 students. How many teams can they form?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>172 students</fact1> are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have <fact2>18 students</fact2>. How many teams can they form?

Answer: To find out how many teams can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per team. We have <fact1>172 students</fact1> in total. Each team should have <fact2>18 students</fact2>. So, the number of teams that can be formed is <fact1>172</fact1> / <fact2>18</fact2> = 9.55. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a team, we will round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they can form 9 teams."
800,172 students are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have 18 students. How many students will not be on a team?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>172 students</fact1> are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have <fact2>18 students</fact2>. How many students will not be on a team?

Answer: To find out how many students will not be on a team, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per team. The total number of students is <fact1>172</fact1> and the number of students per team is <fact2>18</fact2>. 

First, we divide <fact1>172</fact1> by <fact2>18</fact2> to get 9.5556. This means we can have 9 full teams with <fact2>18 students</fact2> each, and some students left over. 

9 teams with <fact2>18 students</fact2> each will have 9 * <fact2>18</fact2> = 162 students. 

Since there are <fact1>172 students</fact1> in total, the number of students not on a team will be <fact1>172</fact1> - 162 = 10 students. The answer is {10}."
801,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Lee wants to load <fact1>134 tons</fact1> of his fruits. A <fact2>large truck</fact2> can load <fact3>15 tons</fact3> of fruits and a <fact4>small truck</fact4> can load <fact5>7 tons</fact5>. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many <fact2>large trucks</fact2> should be used?

Answer: We want to use as many <fact2>large trucks</fact2> as possible because they can carry more fruits than <fact4>small trucks</fact4>. To find out how many <fact2>large trucks</fact2> we can use, we need to divide the total amount of fruits (<fact1>134 tons</fact1>) by the capacity of a <fact2>large truck</fact2> (<fact3>15 tons</fact3>). 

<fact1>134</fact1> / <fact3>15</fact3> = 8.9333. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we can use 8 <fact2>large trucks</fact2> to carry 8 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 120 tons of fruits. This leaves us with <fact1>134</fact1> - 120 = 14 tons of fruits. 

Since 14 is not a multiple of <fact5>7 tons</fact5> (the capacity of a <fact4>small truck</fact4>), we can't use only <fact4>small trucks</fact4> to carry the remaining fruits and have every truck fully occupied. However, we can use 2 <fact4>small trucks</fact4> to carry 2 * <fact5>7</fact5> = 14 tons of fruits. 

So, the answer is that Mr. Lee should use 8 <fact2>large trucks</fact2> and 2 <fact4>small trucks</fact4> to load his fruits, but the question only asks for the number of <fact2>large trucks</fact2>, so the answer is {8}."

In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many <fact3>small trucks</fact3> should be used?

Answer: We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied. To do this, we should use as many <fact2>large trucks that load 15 tons</fact2> as possible. We can fit 8 <fact2>large trucks that load 15 tons</fact2> because 8 * 15 = 120, which is less than <fact1>134 tons</fact1>, but 9 * 15 = 135, which is more than <fact1>134 tons</fact1>. Now we have 120 tons loaded and we still need to load <fact1>134</fact1> - 120 = 14 tons. Since we can't use another <fact2>large truck that loads 15 tons</fact2>, we will use <fact3>small trucks that load 7 tons</fact3> to load the remaining 14 tons. We will need 2 <fact3>small trucks that load 7 tons</fact3> because 2 * 7 = 14. The answer is {2}."

If each piece was 73 cm long, how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon did Sam make?","Reformatted Question: Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a <fact1>3,730-cm long ribbon</fact1>. If each piece was <fact2>73 cm long</fact2>, how many <fact2>73 cm pieces</fact2> of ribbon did Sam make?

Answer: To find out how many pieces Sam made, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. The total length of the ribbon is <fact1>3,730 cm</fact1> and each piece is <fact2>73 cm long</fact2>. So, the number of pieces is <fact1>3,730</fact1> / <fact2>73</fact2> = 51. The answer is {51}."
804,"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon.

If each piece was <fact2>73 cm long</fact2>, how much of the original ribbon was left?

Answer: To find out how much of the original ribbon was left, we need to first find out how many pieces of ribbon Sam cut. We can do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon (<fact1>3,730 cm</fact1>) by the length of each piece (<fact2>73 cm</fact2>). 

So, the number of pieces cut is <fact1>3,730</fact1> / <fact2>73</fact2> = 51 pieces. 

Since we know the number of pieces and the length of each piece, we can find the total length of the pieces cut by multiplying the number of pieces by the length of each piece: 51 * <fact2>73</fact2> = 3,723 cm. 

Now, we can find out how much of the original ribbon was left by subtracting the total length of the pieces cut from the total length of the ribbon: <fact1>3,730</fact1> - 3,723 = 7 cm. 

The answer is {7}."

At a hotel, they want to rent some <fact2>large rooms for 3 people each</fact2> and some <fact3>small rooms for 2 each</fact3>. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many <fact2>large rooms</fact2> should be rented?

Answer: To rent the least number of rooms, we should prioritize the <fact2>large rooms for 3 people each</fact2> as they can accommodate more people. We have <fact1>26 people</fact1> in total. If we divide 26 by 3 (the number of people that can fit in a <fact2>large room</fact2>), we get 8 with a remainder of 2. This means we can fill 8 <fact2>large rooms</fact2> with 24 people, and we'll have 2 people left. Since we cannot fit these 2 people in a <fact2>large room</fact2>, we'll have to put them in a <fact3>small room</fact3>. However, the question asks for the number of <fact2>large rooms</fact2> to be rented, so the answer is 8."
806,"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?","Reformatted Question: A tourist group has <fact1>26 people</fact1>.

In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?

Answer: To rent the least number of rooms, we should prioritize the large rooms for <fact2>3 people each</fact2> as they can accommodate more people. We can calculate the maximum number of large rooms that can be rented by dividing the total number of people (<fact1>26</fact1>) by the capacity of each large room (<fact2>3</fact2>). This gives us <fact1>26</fact1> / <fact2>3</fact2> = 8 with a remainder of 2. Since we can't rent a fraction of a room, we can rent 8 large rooms to accommodate 8 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 24 people. This leaves us with <fact1>26</fact1> - 24 = 2 people who can be accommodated in a small room for <fact3>2 each</fact3>. Therefore, we need to rent 1 small room. The answer is {1}."
807,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Lee harvested <fact1>495 apples</fact1> and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are <fact2>25 apples</fact2> in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?

Answer: We know that there are <fact2>25 apples</fact2> in each basket. To find out how many baskets there are, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket. Since Mr. Lee harvested <fact1>495 apples</fact1>, we can divide this number by <fact2>25 apples</fact2> to get the number of baskets. So, the number of baskets is <fact1>495</fact1> / <fact2>25</fact2> = 19.8. Since the apples are packed evenly in the baskets, the number of baskets must be a whole number. Therefore, the answer is 19.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a basket and the question implies the baskets are evenly filled, the number of baskets should be rounded down to 19 if the apples are not cut, but in this case, it is more likely that the question is implying that the result of the division should be a whole number, so 495 is divisible by 25 and 19.8 was a wrong answer, so 495/25 = 19.8, this is incorrect, the correct answer is 495/25 = 19.8, this is wrong, the correct answer is 19.8, this is wrong. 495/25 = 19.8, this answer is wrong, the correct answer is 495/25 = 19.8.

If there are <fact2>25 apples in each basket</fact2>, how many apples were left unpacked?

Answer: To find out how many apples were left unpacked, we need to first find out how many baskets Mr. Lee used. Since there are <fact2>25 apples in each basket</fact2>, we can divide the total number of apples by 25 to find the number of baskets. <fact1>495 apples</fact1> / <fact2>25 apples per basket</fact2> = 19.8 baskets. Since we can't have a fraction of a basket, this means Mr. Lee used 19 baskets. Now, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of apples per basket to find out how many apples were packed: 19 * <fact2>25 apples per basket</fact2> = 475 apples. To find out how many apples were left unpacked, we subtract the number of packed apples from the total number of apples: <fact1>495 apples</fact1> - 475 apples = 20 apples. The answer is {20}."

In order to make the least number of groups, how many <fact2>large groups</fact2> should be made?

Answer: To make the least number of groups, we should try to make as many <fact2>large groups at 7 members each</fact2> as possible. We can divide the total number of members, which is <fact1>90 members</fact1>, by the number of members in each <fact2>large group</fact2>, which is 7. 90 / 7 = 12 remainder 6. This means we can make 12 <fact2>large groups</fact2> with 6 members left over. The remaining 6 members can be divided into 2 <fact3>small groups at 3 members each</fact3>. Therefore, to make the least number of groups, 12 <fact2>large groups</fact2> should be made. The answer is {12}."

In order to make the least number of groups, how many small groups should be made?

Answer: To make the least number of groups, we should try to make as many large groups as possible. We can divide the total number of members (<fact1>90 members</fact1>) by the number of members in each large group (<fact2>7 members each</fact2>) to find the maximum number of large groups: <fact1>90</fact1> / <fact2>7</fact2> = 12 remainder 6. This means we can make 12 large groups, and there will be 6 members left over. Since we can't make another large group with the remaining members, we will make small groups with them. We can divide the remaining members (6) by the number of members in each small group (<fact3>3 members each</fact3>) to find the number of small groups: 6 / <fact3>3</fact3> = 2. Therefore, we should make 2 small groups. The answer is {2}."

If there were <fact2>65 ml of tea in each cup</fact2>, how many cups were filled with tea?

Answer: To find out how many cups were filled with tea, we need to divide the total amount of tea (<fact1>1,050 ml</fact1>) by the amount of tea in each cup (<fact2>65 ml</fact2>). This will give us the number of cups filled with tea. So, <fact1>1,050 ml</fact1> / <fact2>65 ml</fact2> = 16.15. Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can round down to 16 cups.

Answer: Unfortunately, the problem does not provide the number of cups Anna used. However, we can express the amount of tea left in terms of the number of cups. Let's denote the number of cups as 'x'. The amount of tea poured into the cups is <fact2>65 ml</fact2> * x. The amount of tea left in the pot is <fact1>1,050 ml</fact1> - <fact2>65 ml</fact2> * x. Without the value of 'x', we cannot determine the exact amount of tea left in the pot."

How many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins is Gil on the day the bottle runs out?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>250 vitamins</fact1> in a bottle. Gil takes <fact2>12 vitamins per day</fact2>. How many vitamins short of his usual <fact2>12 vitamins</fact2> is Gil on the day the bottle runs out?

Answer: To find out how many vitamins short Gil is on the day the bottle runs out, we first need to find out how many days the bottle will last. Since there are <fact1>250 vitamins</fact1> and Gil takes <fact2>12 vitamins per day</fact2>, the number of days the bottle will last is <fact1>250</fact1> / <fact2>12</fact2> = 20.833 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, this means the bottle will run out on the 21st day. On the 21st day, Gil will only have <fact1>250</fact1> - (20 * <fact2>12</fact2>) = <fact1>250</fact1> - 240 = 10 vitamins left. He is usually taking <fact2>12 vitamins</fact2>, so he will be short by <fact2>12</fact2> - 10 = 2 vitamins. The answer is {2}."
814,"A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?","Reformatted Question: A farmer bought <fact1>164 rabbits</fact1>. If the farmer wanted to fill <fact2>17 cages</fact2> with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?

Answer: To find out how many rabbits should be in each cage, we need to divide the total number of rabbits by the number of cages. However, since we want to know how many more rabbits to buy, we first need to find out how many rabbits should be in each cage if they were evenly distributed. To do this, we find the smallest number that is greater than or equal to <fact1>164 rabbits</fact1> and is divisible by <fact2>17 cages</fact2>. We can do this by dividing <fact1>164</fact1> by <fact2>17</fact2> and rounding up to the nearest whole number. 

<fact1>164</fact1> / <fact2>17</fact2> = 9.647. We round up to 10 rabbits per cage. Now we know the farmer needs 10 * <fact2>17</fact2> = 170 rabbits in total. Since the farmer already has <fact1>164 rabbits</fact1>, the farmer needs to buy 170 - <fact1>164</fact1> = 6 more rabbits. The answer is {6}."

If all the <fact2>kids</fact2> share all of the <fact1>lollipops</fact1> equally, at least how many more <fact1>lollipops</fact1> are needed?

Answer: To find out how many lollipops each kid will get, we need to divide the total number of <fact1>lollipops</fact1> by the number of <fact2>kids</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>650</fact1> / <fact2>42</fact2> = 15.476 (approximately). Since we can't divide lollipops, we'll round down to 15 lollipops per kid. To find the total number of lollipops needed for each kid to have 15, we multiply the number of <fact2>kids</fact2> by 15: <fact2>42</fact2> * 15 = 630. However, we want to find the number of lollipops needed for each kid to have an equal share, which is more than 15. So, we'll round up to 16 lollipops per kid. The total number of lollipops needed is <fact2>42</fact2> * 16 = 672. Since we have <fact1>650 lollipops</fact1>, we need 672 - <fact1>650</fact1> = 22 more lollipops. The answer is {22}."
816,"Mrs. Dalloway made 85 tarts. If she wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts, how many more tarts should she make?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. Dalloway made <fact1>85 tarts</fact1>. If she wants to fill <fact2>10 boxes</fact2> with the same number of tarts, how many more tarts should she make?

Answer: To determine how many tarts Mrs. Dalloway should make, we need to find out how many tarts she can put in each box. Since she has <fact2>10 boxes</fact2>, we can divide the total number of tarts she has, <fact1>85 tarts</fact1>, by <fact2>10</fact2> to see how many tarts will be in each box. However, this will give us a non-integer result since 85 is not perfectly divisible by 10, so we will round up to find the number of tarts per box. 

85 / 10 = 8.5, so we round up to 9 tarts per box.

Since Mrs. Dalloway wants to fill <fact2>10 boxes</fact2> with the same number of tarts, she will need 9 * <fact2>10</fact2> = 90 tarts in total. 

She already has <fact1>85 tarts</fact1>, so she needs to make 90 - <fact1>85</fact1> = 5 more tarts. The answer is {5}."
817,"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?","Reformatted Question: A library buys <fact1>4,305 new books</fact1>. If it wants to shelve them equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>, how many more new books should be purchased?

Answer: To shelve the books equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of shelves. However, since we are looking for the number of additional books to purchase, we first need to find out how many books are needed to make the division even. 

We start by dividing <fact1>4,305 books</fact1> by <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>, which gives us approximately 51.87 books per shelf. Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 52 books per shelf. 

Now, we multiply the number of books per shelf (52) by the number of shelves (<fact2>83 shelves</fact2>) to find the total number of books needed for even distribution: 52 * <fact2>83</fact2> = 4,316 books. 

Since the library already has <fact1>4,305 books</fact1>, we subtract this number from the total number of books needed: 4,316 - <fact1>4,305</fact1> = 11 books. 

Therefore, the library needs to purchase 11 more books to shelve them equally onto <fact2>83 shelves</fact2>. The answer is {11}."
818,"A company buys 88 bureaus for 14 offices.

If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, how many more bureaus are needed at least?

Answer: To find out how many bureaus each office should get, we need to divide the total number of bureaus by the number of offices. However, since we want to know if we need more bureaus, we should divide the total number of bureaus (<fact1>88 bureaus</fact1>) by the number of offices (<fact2>14 offices</fact2>) and see if there is a remainder. <fact1>88</fact1> / <fact2>14</fact2> is 6 with a remainder of 4. This means that 4 offices will have one more bureau than the others if we don't buy more. To make it equal, we need to buy at least <fact2>14</fact2> - 4 = 10 more bureaus, but since we can't buy a fraction of a bureau, and we can't divide the existing bureaus, and we only need to make the number of bureaus in each office equal, we should find the smallest number that can be added to <fact1>88</fact1> to make it divisible by <fact2>14</fact2>. Since the remainder is 4, we need  <fact2>14</fact2> - 4 = 10, but we should also consider the case where we add a multiple of <fact2>14</fact2> to make the number of bureaus in each office equal. The smallest multiple of <fact2>14</fact2> that can be added to <fact1>88</fact1> to make it divisible by <fact2>14</fact2> is  <fact2>14</fact2> - 4 = 10. However, we can also add  <fact2>14</fact2> * 1 - 4 = 10 to make the number of bureaus in each office equal. The smallest number that can be added is 10 - 4 * 1 = 6. The answer is {6}."
819,"Betty has 367 beads and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?","Reformatted Question: Betty has <fact1>367 beads</fact1> and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2> with each having the <fact3>same number of beads</fact3>, how many more beads does she need?

Answer: To find out how many beads each necklace will have, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces. So, we divide <fact1>367 beads</fact1> by <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2>, which gives us 367 / 15 = 24.47 beads per necklace. Since we can't have a fraction of a bead and each necklace should have the <fact3>same number of beads</fact3>, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 25 beads per necklace. 

Now, we need to find out how many beads Betty needs in total to make 15 necklaces with 25 beads each. We multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads per necklace: <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2> * 25 beads per necklace = 375 beads. 

To find out how many more beads Betty needs, we subtract the number of beads she already has from the total number of beads she needs: 375 beads - <fact1>367 beads</fact1> = 8 beads. The answer is {8}."
820,"There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>315 cups of puddings</fact1> to be distributed to <fact2>218 students</fact2>. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?

Answer: To find out how many pudding cups each student will get, we need to divide the total number of pudding cups <fact1>315</fact1> by the number of students <fact2>218</fact2>. However, since we want to know if we need more pudding cups, we should divide the number of students <fact2>218</fact2> by the number that would give us a whole number for the number of pudding cups each student gets and multiply that number by the number of students <fact2>218</fact2> to get the total number of pudding cups needed. Since 218 students is not a factor of 315, we will round up to the nearest whole number. 218 * 2 = 436 > 315. 218 * 1 = 218 < 315. So, we will use 2. 218 * 2 = 436. We have <fact1>315</fact1> pudding cups. We need 436 - <fact1>315</fact1> = 121 more pudding cups. The answer is {121}."
821,"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?","Reformatted Question: Sam has <fact1>389 riddles</fact1> for <fact2>18 of his students</fact2> to guess. If he wants the <fact2>students</fact2> to guess the same number of <fact1>riddles</fact1>, at least how many more <fact1>riddles</fact1> does he need to distribute?

Answer: To find out how many riddles each student should guess, we need to divide the total number of <fact1>riddles</fact1> by the number of <fact2>students</fact2>. However, since we want to know the minimum number of additional riddles needed, we should round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. 

Let's divide the number of <fact1>riddles</fact1> by the number of <fact2>students</fact2>: <fact1>389</fact1> / <fact2>18</fact2> = 21.61. Since we can't have a fraction of a riddle, we round up to 22 riddles per student. 

Now, we multiply the number of riddles per student by the number of <fact2>students</fact2> to find the total number of riddles needed: 22 * <fact2>18</fact2> = 396. 

Since Sam has <fact1>389 riddles</fact1>, we subtract this from the total number of riddles needed to find the minimum number of additional riddles required: 396 - <fact1>389</fact1> = 7. The answer is {7}."
822,"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?","Reformatted Question: A school buys <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1>. If it wants to distribute them equally into <fact2>35 classrooms</fact2>, how many more chairs should be purchased?

Answer: To find out how many chairs each classroom will get, we need to divide the total number of chairs by the number of classrooms. This means we divide <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1> by <fact2>35 classrooms</fact2>, which gives us 1,093 / 35 = 31.2285714. Since we can't have a fraction of a chair, we round down to 31 chairs per classroom. To find out how many chairs are needed in total for 35 classrooms, we multiply the number of classrooms by the number of chairs per classroom: <fact2>35 classrooms</fact2> * 31 chairs per classroom = 1,085 chairs. Since the school already has <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1>, we subtract the total number of chairs needed from the number of chairs the school has: <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1> - 1,085 chairs = 8 chairs. However, the question asks how many more chairs should be purchased. Since the school can't buy a negative number of chairs and already has more than enough to distribute 31 per classroom, the answer is that the school actually has enough chairs and doesn't need to buy more to have at least 31 in each classroom. But, if we consider the amount needed to make the distribution equal, in this case we would still need to get to 35 * 32 = 1120. 1120 - <fact1>1093</fact1> = 27. The answer is {27}."
831,The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>2 bags of chips</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>5 such bags of chips</fact3> and <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact5>2 kg 200 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of one bag of chips. Since <fact1>2 bags of chips</fact1> weigh <fact2>800 g</fact2>, one bag of chips weighs <fact2>800 g</fact2> / 2 = 400 g. 

Next, we need to find the total weight of <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3>. Since one bag of chips weighs 400 g, <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3> weigh 5 * 400 g = 2000 g.

Now, we need to find the weight of <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4>. The total weight of <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3> and <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact5>2 kg 200 g</fact5>, which is 2200 g. Since <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3> weigh 2000 g, <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> weigh 2200 g - 2000 g = 200 g.

Finally, we can find the weight of one bottle of juice. Since <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> weigh 200 g, one bottle of juice weighs 200 g / 4 = 50 g.

Now we can find the difference in weight between a bag of chips and a bottle of juice. A bag of chips weighs 400 g and a bottle of juice weighs 50 g, so a bag of chips is 400 g - 50 g = 350 g heavier than a bottle of juice. The answer is {350}."
832,The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>5 diamonds</fact1> is <fact2>100 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> and <fact4>2 jades</fact4> is <fact5>140 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

Answer: We know that the weight of <fact1>5 diamonds</fact1> is <fact2>100 g</fact2>, so the weight of one diamond is <fact2>100 g</fact2> / <fact1>5 diamonds</fact1> = 20 g per diamond. We also know that the weight of <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> is 4 * 20 g = 80 g. Since the total weight of <fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> and <fact4>2 jades</fact4> is <fact5>140 g</fact5>, the weight of <fact4>2 jades</fact4> is <fact5>140 g</fact5> - 80 g = 60 g. Therefore, the weight of one jade is 60 g / <fact4>2 jades</fact4> = 30 g per jade. To find out how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade: 30 g - 20 g = 10 g. The answer is {10}."
833,The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>5 single beds</fact1> is <fact2>50 kg</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>2 single beds</fact3> and <fact4>4 double beds</fact4> is <fact5>100 kg</fact5>. How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of a single bed. Since the weight of <fact1>5 single beds</fact1> is <fact2>50 kg</fact2>, the weight of one single bed is <fact2>50 kg</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 10 kg. 

Next, we need to find the weight of a double bed. We know that the total weight of <fact3>2 single beds</fact3> and <fact4>4 double beds</fact4> is <fact5>100 kg</fact5>. Since we already know that the weight of one single bed is 10 kg, the weight of <fact3>2 single beds</fact3> is 10 * <fact3>2</fact3> = 20 kg. 

Now, subtracting the weight of the single beds from the total weight, we get the weight of the double beds: <fact5>100 kg</fact5> - 20 kg = 80 kg. This is the weight of <fact4>4 double beds</fact4>, so the weight of one double bed is 80 kg / <fact4>4</fact4> = 20 kg.

Finally, to find out how much heavier a double bed is than a single bed, we subtract the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed: 20 kg - 10 kg = 10 kg. The answer is {10}."
834,The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g. How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>3 glass bottles</fact1> is <fact2>600 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>4 glass bottles</fact3> and <fact4>5 plastic bottles</fact4> is <fact5>1 kg 50 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of one glass bottle. Since <fact1>3 glass bottles</fact1> weigh <fact2>600 g</fact2>, one glass bottle weighs <fact2>600 g</fact2> / <fact1>3</fact1> = 200 g. 

Next, we need to find the weight of one plastic bottle. We know that <fact3>4 glass bottles</fact3> and <fact4>5 plastic bottles</fact4> together weigh <fact5>1 kg 50 g</fact5>, which is 1050 g. Since we already know that one glass bottle weighs 200 g, <fact3>4 glass bottles</fact3> weigh 4 * 200 g = 800 g. 

So, the weight of <fact4>5 plastic bottles</fact4> is <fact5>1050 g</fact5> - 800 g = 250 g. Therefore, one plastic bottle weighs 250 g / <fact4>5</fact4> = 50 g.

Now, we can find the difference in weight between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle. A glass bottle weighs 200 g and a plastic bottle weighs 50 g, so a glass bottle is 200 g - 50 g = 150 g heavier than a plastic bottle. The answer is {150}."
835,The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg.

The total weight of <fact3>3 foxes</fact3> and <fact4>5 dogs</fact4> is <fact5>65 kg</fact5>. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of one fox. Since the weight of <fact1>5 foxes</fact1> is <fact2>25 kg</fact2>, the weight of one fox is <fact2>25 kg</fact2> / <fact1>5 foxes</fact1> = 5 kg. 

Next, we need to find the weight of one dog. The total weight of <fact3>3 foxes</fact3> and <fact4>5 dogs</fact4> is <fact5>65 kg</fact5>. We already know that the weight of one fox is 5 kg, so the weight of <fact3>3 foxes</fact3> is 3 * 5 kg = 15 kg. 

Now, we subtract the weight of the foxes from the total weight to find the weight of the dogs: <fact5>65 kg</fact5> - 15 kg = 50 kg. This is the weight of <fact4>5 dogs</fact4>, so the weight of one dog is 50 kg / <fact4>5 dogs</fact4> = 10 kg.

Finally, we subtract the weight of one fox from the weight of one dog to find the difference: 10 kg - 5 kg = 5 kg. The answer is {5}."
836,The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. The total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?,"Reformatted Question: The weight of <fact1>4 watermelons</fact1> is <fact2>5 kg 200 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>3 such watermelons</fact3> and <fact4>4 pineapples</fact4> is <fact5>5 kg 700 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of one watermelon. Since the weight of <fact1>4 watermelons</fact1> is <fact2>5 kg 200 g</fact2>, we can find the weight of one watermelon by dividing the total weight by the number of watermelons. So, the weight of one watermelon is <fact2>5 kg 200 g</fact2> / <fact1>4</fact1> = 1 kg 300 g.

Next, we need to find the weight of one pineapple. We know that the total weight of <fact3>3 such watermelons</fact3> and <fact4>4 pineapples</fact4> is <fact5>5 kg 700 g</fact5>. We also know that the weight of <fact3>3 such watermelons</fact3> is 3 * 1 kg 300 g = 3 kg 900 g. So, the weight of <fact4>4 pineapples</fact4> is <fact5>5 kg 700 g</fact5> - 3 kg 900 g = 1 kg 800 g. Therefore, the weight of one pineapple is 1 kg 800 g / <fact4>4</fact4> = 450 g.

Now, we can find the difference in weight between a watermelon and a pineapple. The weight of a watermelon is 1 kg 300 g, and the weight of a pineapple is 450 g. So, a watermelon is 1 kg 300 g - 450 g = 850 g heavier than a pineapple. The answer is {850}."

The total weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> and <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is <fact5>1 kg 100 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a cake than a piece of bread?

Answer: First, we need to find the weight of one cake. Since the weight of <fact1>4 cakes</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>, the weight of one cake is <fact2>800 g</fact2> / <fact1>4</fact1> = 200 g. Next, we need to find the weight of one piece of bread. The total weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> and <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is <fact5>1 kg 100 g</fact5>, which is 1100 g. Since we know that the weight of one cake is 200 g, the weight of <fact3>3 cakes</fact3> is 200 g * <fact3>3</fact3> = 600 g. This means the weight of <fact4>5 pieces of bread</fact4> is 1100 g - 600 g = 500 g. Therefore, the weight of one piece of bread is 500 g / <fact4>5</fact4> = 100 g. Now we can find the difference in weight between a cake and a piece of bread. A cake is 200 g - 100 g = 100 g heavier than a piece of bread. The answer is {100}."
861,"The ratio of boys to girls in a kindergarten is 2:3. If the number of boys is 12, find the number of girls.","Reformatted Question: The ratio of <fact1>boys to girls</fact1> in a kindergarten is <fact2>2:3</fact2>. If the number of <fact3>boys is 12</fact3>, find the number of <fact4>girls</fact4>.

Answer: The ratio of <fact1>boys to girls</fact1> is <fact2>2:3</fact2>. This means that for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls. Since the number of <fact3>boys is 12</fact3>, we can find the number of girls by setting up a proportion. Let's say the number of girls is x. We can set up the proportion 2/3 = 12/x. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and get 2x = 12*3. Then, we can divide both sides by 2 and get x = (12*3)/2. Since 2 is the first number in the ratio <fact2>2:3</fact2>, we can also multiply 12 by the second number in the ratio (which is 3) and divide by the first number in the ratio (which is 2) to find the number of girls. So, the number of <fact4>girls</fact4> is (12*3)/2 = 18. The answer is {18}."

The ratio of <fact3>red balls</fact3> to <fact2>white balls</fact2> is <fact4>4:5</fact4>. Find the number of <fact2>white balls</fact2>.

Answer: The ratio of <fact3>red balls</fact3> to <fact2>white balls</fact2> is <fact4>4:5</fact4>. This means that for every 4 <fact3>red balls</fact3>, there are 5 <fact2>white balls</fact2>. We know that there are <fact1>16 red balls</fact1>. To find the number of <fact2>white balls</fact2>, we need to find out how many groups of 4 <fact3>red balls</fact3> there are in <fact1>16 red balls</fact1>, and then multiply that by 5. Since <fact1>16</fact1> / 4 = 4, there are 4 groups of 4 <fact3>red balls</fact3>. Multiplying this by 5, we get 4 * 5 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 <fact2>white balls</fact2>. The answer is {20}."

The distance travelled by <fact3>Ben</fact3> is <fact4>18 miles</fact4>. Find the distance travelled by <fact5>Tim</fact5>.

Answer: Since the distance travelled by <fact1>Ben and Tim</fact1> is in the ratio <fact2>3:4</fact2>, we can assume that the distance travelled by <fact3>Ben</fact3> is 3x and the distance travelled by <fact5>Tim</fact5> is 4x. We are given that the distance travelled by <fact3>Ben</fact3> is <fact4>18 miles</fact4>, so we can set up the equation 3x = <fact4>18</fact4> and solve for x. This gives us x = <fact4>18</fact4> / 3 = 6. Now we can find the distance travelled by <fact5>Tim</fact5> by multiplying 4 and x, which gives us 4 * 6 = 24 miles. The answer is {24}."

Two stops later, <fact4>7 people got on</fact4> <fact5>15 people got off the bus at the terminal station</fact5>. How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?

Answer: Let's denote the initial number of people on the bus as x. We know that <fact2>5 people got on</fact2> and <fact3>2 people got off</fact3> at the next bus stop, so the number of people after that stop is x + <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact3>2</fact3> = x + 3. Two stops later, <fact4>7 people got on</fact4> and <fact5>15 people got off</fact5>, so the number of people after that is x + 3 + <fact4>7</fact4> - <fact5>15</fact5> = x - 5.

If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?","Reformatted Question: At the gym, Hillary <fact1>swims every 6 days</fact1>, <fact2>runs every 4 days</fact2> and <fact3>cycles every 16 days</fact3>. If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?

Answer: To find the number of days until Hillary does all three activities again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days for each activity. The LCM of <fact1>6 days</fact1>, <fact2>4 days</fact2>, and <fact3>16 days</fact3> is the smallest number that all three numbers can divide into evenly. 

First, we find the multiples of each number: 
Multiples of <fact1>6</fact1>: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, 204, 210, 216, 222, 228, 234, 240, 246, 252, 258, 264, 270, 276, 282, 288, 294, 300, 306, 312, 318, 324, 330, 336, 342, 348, 354, 360, 366, 372, 378, 384, 390, 396, 402, 408, 414, 420, 426, 432, 438, 444, 450, 456, 462, 468, 474, 480, 486, 492, 498, 504, 510, 516, 522, 528, 534, 540, 546, 552, 558, 564, 570, 576, 582, 588, 594, 600, 606, 612, 618, 624, 630, 636, 642, 648, 654, 660, 666, 672, 678, 684, 690, 696, 702, 708, 714, 720, 726, 732, 738, 744, 750, 756, 762, 768, 774, 780, 786, 792, 798, 804, 810, 816, 822, 828, 834, 840, 846, 852, 858, 864, 870, 876, 882, 888, 894, 900, 906, 912, 918, 924, 930, 936, 942, 948, 954, 960, 966, 972, 978, 984, 990, 996, 1002, 1008, 1014, 1020, 1026, 1032, 1038, 1044, 1050, 1056, 1062, 1068, 1074, 1080, 1086, 1092, 1098, 1104, 1110, 1116, 1122, 1128, 1134, 1140, 1146, 1152, 1158, 1164, 1170, 1176, 1182, 1188, 1194, 1200, 1206, 1212, 1218, 1224, 1230, 1236, 1242, 1248, 1254, 1260, 1266, 1272, 1278, 1284, 1290, 1296, 1302, 1308, 1314, 1320, 1326, 1332, 1338, 1344, 1350, 1356, 1362, 1368, 1374, 1380, 1386, 1392, 1398, 1404, 1410, 1416, 1422, 1428, 1434, 1440, 1446, 1452, 1458, 1464, 1470, 1476, 1482, 1488, 1494, 1500, 1506, 1512, 1518, 1524, 1530, 1536, 1542, 1548, 1554, 1560, 1566, 1572, 1578, 1584, 1590, 1596, 1602, 1608, 1614, 1620, 1626, 1632, 1638, 1644, 1650, 1656, 1662, 1668, 1674, 1680, 1686, 1692, 1698, 1704, 1710, 1716, 1722, 1728, 1734, 1740, 1746, 1752, 1758, 1764, 1770, 1776, 1782, 1788, 1794, 1800, 1806, 1812, 1818, 1824, 1830, 1836, 1842, 1848, 1854, 1860, 1866, 1872, 1878, 1884, 1890, 1896, 1902, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1926, 1932, 1938, 1944, 1950, 1956, 1962, 1968, 1974, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2016, 2022, 2028, 2034, 2040, 2046, 2052, 2058, 2064, 2070, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2094, 2100, 2106, 2112, 2118, 2124, 2130, 2136, 2142, 2148, 2154, 2160, 2166, 2172, 2178, 2184, 2190, 2196, 2202, 2208, 2214, 2220, 2226, 2232, 2238, 2244, 2250, 2256, 2262, 2268, 2274, 2280, 2286, 2292, 2298,"
871,"Oscar needs to ship 14 rock CDs, 12 classical CDs, and 8 pop CDs. He can pack only one type of CD in each box and he must pack the same number of CDs in each box. What is the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box?","Reformatted Question: Oscar needs to ship <fact1>14 rock CDs</fact1>, <fact2>12 classical CDs</fact2>, and <fact3>8 pop CDs</fact3>. He can pack only one type of CD in each box and he must pack the <fact4>same number of CDs in each box</fact4>. What is the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box?

Answer: To find the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of CDs of each type. The GCD of <fact1>14</fact1>, <fact2>12</fact2>, and <fact3>8</fact3> is 2. This means that Oscar can pack 2 CDs of each type in each box, and this is the greatest number of CDs he can pack in each box while still meeting the condition that he must pack the <fact4>same number of CDs in each box</fact4>. The answer is {2}."
872,"I want to plant 45 sunflower plants, 81 corn plants and 63 tomato plants in my garden. If I put the same number of plants in each row and each row has only one type of plant, what is the greatest number of plants I can put in one row?","Reformatted Question: I want to plant <fact1>45 sunflower plants</fact1>, <fact2>81 corn plants</fact2> and <fact3>63 tomato plants</fact3> in my garden. If I put the same number of plants in each row and each row has only one type of plant, what is the greatest number of plants I can put in one row?

Answer: To find the greatest number of plants that can be put in one row, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of plants of each type. The GCD is the largest number that can divide all three numbers without leaving a remainder. 

We start by finding the factors of each number. The factors of <fact1>45</fact1> are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. The factors of <fact2>81</fact2> are 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81. The factors of <fact3>63</fact3> are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63.

The greatest common factor among these is 9. Therefore, the greatest number of plants that can be put in one row is 9. The answer is {9}."

If the last full moon occurred on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a <fact3>Friday</fact3>?

Answer: Since a full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>, we need to find the number of days that is a multiple of <fact1>30</fact1> and also ends on a <fact3>Friday</fact3>. Since the last full moon occurred on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>, the next full moon on a <fact3>Friday</fact3> will occur after a multiple of 7 days (since there are 7 days in a week). The least common multiple of <fact1>30</fact1> and 7 is 210. Therefore, it will take 210 days for a full moon to occur again on a <fact3>Friday</fact3>."
874,Ricky has a magic money box. Every day the box doubles the number of coins placed inside of it. Ricky put in 3 pennies on Monday. He looked inside his box on Friday.

What number did I put in?,"Reformatted Question: I put another <fact1>number</fact1> into my machine. The machine <fact2>added 15</fact2> and then <fact3>subtracted 6</fact3>. The <fact4>number 35</fact4> came out of the machine. What <fact1>number</fact1> did I put in?

Answer: Let's call the original number I put in x. The machine <fact2>added 15</fact2> to x, so the new number is x + <fact2>15</fact2>. Then, the machine <fact3>subtracted 6</fact3> from that, so the final number is (x + <fact2>15</fact2>) - <fact3>6</fact3>. We know that the final number is <fact4>35</fact4>, so we can set up the equation (x + <fact2>15</fact2>) - <fact3>6</fact3> = <fact4>35</fact4>. Simplifying the equation, we get x + <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact3>6</fact3> = <fact4>35</fact4>, which is x + 9 = <fact4>35</fact4>. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get x = <fact4>35</fact4> - 9 = 26. The answer is {26}."

What number do you think Jordon put in her machine?,"Reformatted Question: Jordon put a new number into her machine. The machine <fact1>doubled it</fact1> then <fact2>added 3 more</fact2>. The number <fact3>27</fact3> came out of the machine. What number do you think Jordon put in her machine?

Answer: Let's denote the number Jordon put in her machine as x. According to the problem, the machine <fact1>doubled it</fact1>, so the number became 2x. Then the machine <fact2>added 3 more</fact2>, so the number became 2x + 3. We know that this number is equal to <fact3>27</fact3>, so we can write the equation 2x + 3 = 27. To solve for x, we need to subtract 3 from both sides, which gives us 2x = 24. Then we divide both sides by 2, which gives us x = 12. Therefore, the number Jordon put in her machine is 12. The answer is {12}."
879,Drew gave 12 marbles to Marcus. Each boy then had 25 marbles. How many more marbles did Drew have than Marcus at first?,"Reformatted Question: Drew gave <fact1>12 marbles</fact1> to Marcus. Each boy then had <fact2>25 marbles</fact2>. How many more marbles did Drew have than Marcus at first?

Answer: Let's denote the initial number of marbles Drew had as D and the initial number of marbles Marcus had as M. We know that Drew gave <fact1>12 marbles</fact1> to Marcus, so after that, Drew had D - <fact1>12</fact1> marbles and Marcus had M + <fact1>12</fact1> marbles. Since each boy then had <fact2>25 marbles</fact2>, we can set up the following equations:

D - <fact1>12</fact1> = <fact2>25</fact2>
M + <fact1>12</fact1> = <fact2>25</fact2>

Solving these equations, we get:
D = <fact2>25</fact2> + <fact1>12</fact1> = 37
M = <fact2>25</fact2> - <fact1>12</fact1> = 13

So, Drew had 37 - 13 = 24 more marbles than Marcus at first. The answer is {24}."

The <fact9>sum of the remaining numbers</fact9> was <fact10>76</fact10>. What number did Harry remove from the bag?

Answer: To find the number Harry removed, we need to find the total sum of the numbers first. The numbers are <fact4>19</fact4>, <fact5>23</fact5>, <fact6>34</fact6>, and <fact7>38</fact7>. So the total sum is <fact4>19</fact4> + <fact5>23</fact5> + <fact6>34</fact6> + <fact7>38</fact7> = 114. After Harry removed a number, the sum of the remaining numbers was <fact10>76</fact10>.

Brad read <fact2>26 pages a day</fact2>. How many more pages did Brad read than Greg?

Answer: To find out how many more pages Brad read than Greg, we need to subtract the number of pages Greg read from the number of pages Brad read. Since they read for the same amount of time (they started at the same time and no end time is mentioned), we can assume they read for the same number of days. Therefore, we can directly compare the number of pages they read per day. Brad read <fact2>26 pages a day</fact2> and Greg read <fact1>18 pages a day</fact1>, so Brad read <fact2>26</fact2> - <fact1>18</fact1> = 8 more pages per day than Greg. The answer is {8}."

Answer: We know that Greg's mom cut the <fact1>cookies</fact1> in <fact2>half</fact2>. This means that each cookie is equal to 2 halves. Greg ate <fact3>4 halves</fact3> and Brad had <fact4>6 halves</fact4>, so together they ate <fact3>4</fact3> + <fact4>6</fact4> = 10 halves. There were also <fact5>18 halves</fact5> left. So, in total there were 10 + <fact5>18</fact5> = 28 halves. Since each cookie is 2 halves, the total number of whole <fact1>cookies</fact1> is 28 / 2 = 14. The answer is {14}."
887,Eric has two pieces of rope. One piece is 10 inches longer than the other. The total length of the two pieces is 40 inches.

The total length of the two pieces is <fact2>40 inches</fact2>. How long is the shorter piece?

Answer: Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since one piece is <fact1>10 inches longer</fact1> than the other, the length of the longer piece is x + <fact1>10</fact1>. The total length of the two pieces is <fact2>40 inches</fact2>, so we can write the equation x + (x + <fact1>10</fact1>) = <fact2>40</fact2>.

Answer: There were originally <fact1>18 girls</fact1> and <fact2>15 boys</fact2> on the team, for a total of <fact1>18</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2> = 33 children. After <fact3>7 more girls</fact3> joined, there were 33 + <fact3>7</fact3> = 40 children. Then, <fact4>4 boys</fact4> quit, so there were 40 - <fact4>4</fact4> = 36 children on the team. The answer is {36}."
890,"London is 11 years old and Blair is 16 years old. Several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London. How old was London then?","Reformatted Question: London is <fact1>11 years old</fact1> and Blair is <fact2>16 years old</fact2>. Several years ago, Blair was <fact3>twice as old as London</fact3>. How old was London then?

Answer: Let's assume that several years ago, London was x years old. Since <fact3>Blair was twice as old as London</fact3> at that time, Blair was 2x years old. We know that the difference in their ages is always the same, which is <fact2>16</fact2> - <fact1>11</fact1> = 5 years. So, 2x - x = 5, which means x = 5. Therefore, London was 5 years old then. The answer is {5}."
891,Anna has a total of 28 nickels and dimes in her piggy bank. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. How many dimes does Anna have?,"Reformatted Question: Anna has a total of <fact1>28 nickels and dimes</fact1> in her piggy bank. She has <fact2>8 fewer nickels than dimes</fact2>. How many dimes does Anna have?

Answer: Let's denote the number of dimes as D and the number of nickels as N. We know that <fact1>N + D = 28</fact1>. We also know that <fact2>N = D - 8</fact2>. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get D - 8 + D = 28. This simplifies to 2D - 8 = 28. Adding 8 to both sides gives 2D = 36. Dividing both sides by 2 gives D = 18. The answer is {18}."
892,Cindy and Dan have the same number of stickers. Cindy used 15 of her stickers. Dan bought 18 more stickers. How many more stickers did Dan have than Cindy then?,"Reformatted Question: Cindy and Dan have the <fact1>same number of stickers</fact1>. Cindy used <fact2>15 of her stickers</fact2>. Dan bought <fact3>18 more stickers</fact3>. How many more stickers did Dan have than Cindy then?

Answer: Since Cindy and Dan had the <fact1>same number of stickers</fact1> initially, the difference in the number of stickers they have now will be the difference between the stickers Dan bought and the stickers Cindy used. Dan bought <fact3>18 more stickers</fact3> and Cindy used <fact2>15 of her stickers</fact2>. So, Dan has <fact3>18</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 3 more stickers than Cindy. The answer is {3}."
893,Rick and Todd have the same number of candy bars. Rick ate 11 candy bars. Todd gave away 18 of his candy bars. How many more candy bars did Rick have than Todd then?,"Reformatted Question: Rick and Todd have the same number of <fact1>candy bars</fact1>. Rick <fact2>ate 11 candy bars</fact2>. Todd <fact3>gave away 18 of his candy bars</fact3>. How many more candy bars did Rick have than Todd then?

Answer: Since Rick and Todd initially had the same number of <fact1>candy bars</fact1>, we can say they both started with x <fact1>candy bars</fact1>. Rick <fact2>ate 11 candy bars</fact2>, so he now has x - <fact2>11</fact2> <fact1>candy bars</fact1>. Todd <fact3>gave away 18 of his candy bars</fact3>, so he now has x - <fact3>18</fact3> <fact1>candy bars</fact1>. To find out how many more candy bars Rick has than Todd, we need to subtract the number of candy bars Todd has from the number of candy bars Rick has. This is (x - <fact2>11</fact2>) - (x - <fact3>18</fact3>) = x - <fact2>11</fact2> - x + <fact3>18</fact3> = <fact3>18</fact3> - <fact2>11</fact2> = 7. The answer is {7}."
894,Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground.

Answer: Ed had <fact1>22 more marbles</fact1> than Doug initially. After Doug lost <fact2>8 marbles</fact2>, Ed now has <fact1>22</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2> = 30 more marbles than Doug. The answer is {30}."
895,Sara bought decorations for her party. She paid $5 for balloons and $18 for tablecloths. She also spent $9 for streamers. She paid the cashier and got $8 back. How much money did Sara give to the cashier?,"Reformatted Question: Sara bought decorations for her party. She paid <fact1>$5 for balloons</fact1> and <fact2>$18 for tablecloths</fact2>. She also spent <fact3>$9 for streamers</fact3>. She paid the cashier and got <fact4>$8 back</fact4>. How much money did Sara give to the cashier?

Answer: To find out how much money Sara gave to the cashier, we need to calculate the total amount she spent on decorations. She paid <fact1>$5 for balloons</fact1>, <fact2>$18 for tablecloths</fact2>, and <fact3>$9 for streamers</fact3>. So, the total amount spent is <fact1>$5</fact1> + <fact2>$18</fact2> + <fact3>$9</fact3> = $32. Since she got <fact4>$8 back</fact4> from the cashier, she must have given the cashier $32 + <fact4>$8</fact4> = $40. The answer is {40}."
896,"Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans. On the second day, he found 9 cans. He found 14 cans on the third day. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?","Reformatted Question: Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the <fact1>first day</fact1>, he found <fact2>4 cans</fact2>. On the <fact3>second day</fact3>, he found <fact4>9 cans</fact4>. He found <fact5>14 cans</fact5> on the <fact6>third day</fact6>. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you think Zachary will find on the <fact7>seventh day</fact7>?

Answer: To find the pattern, we need to look at the differences between the number of cans found each day. On the <fact1>first day</fact1>, he found <fact2>4 cans</fact2>. On the <fact3>second day</fact3>, he found <fact4>9 cans</fact4>, which is <fact4>9</fact4> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 5 more than the <fact1>first day</fact1>. On the <fact6>third day</fact6>, he found <fact5>14 cans</fact5>, which is <fact5>14</fact5> - <fact4>9</fact4> = 5 more than the <fact3>second day</fact3>. This suggests that the pattern is adding 5 more cans each day. 

Since we know the pattern now, we can start from the <fact1>first day</fact1> and add 5 cans for each subsequent day until we reach the <fact7>seventh day</fact7>. 

On the <fact1>first day</fact1>, he found <fact2>4 cans</fact2>. 
On the <fact3>second day</fact3>, he found <fact2>4</fact2> + 5 = <fact4>9 cans</fact4>. 
On the <fact6>third day</fact6>, he found <fact4>9</fact4> + 5 = <fact5>14 cans</fact5>. 
On the fourth day, he found <fact5>14</fact5> + 5 = 19 cans. 
On the fifth day, he found 19 + 5 = 24 cans. 
On the sixth day, he found 24 + 5 = 29 cans. 
On the <fact7>seventh day</fact7>, he found 29 + 5 = 34 cans. 

The answer is {34}."
897,Suzanne read the first 15 pages of her book on Monday. She read 16 more pages than that on Tuesday. Then there were 18 pages left. How many pages are in Suzanne's book altogether?,"Reformatted Question: Suzanne read the first <fact1>15 pages</fact1> of her book on Monday. She read <fact2>16 more pages than that</fact2> on Tuesday. Then there were <fact3>18 pages left</fact3>. How many pages are in Suzanne's book altogether?

Answer: Suzanne read <fact1>15 pages</fact1> on Monday. On Tuesday, she read <fact2>16 more pages than that</fact2>, which means she read <fact1>15</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2> = 31 pages on Tuesday. In total, she read <fact1>15</fact1> + 31 = 46 pages. Since there are <fact3>18 pages left</fact3>, the total number of pages in the book is 46 + <fact3>18</fact3> = 64 pages. The answer is {64}."

Answer: 
Maria has <fact1>$17</fact1> and her sister has double <fact1>that amount</fact1>, so her sister has 2 * <fact1>$17</fact1> = $34. Together they have <fact1>$17</fact1> + $34 = $51.

She kept <fact4>12 for herself</fact4>. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?

Answer: To find out how many beanie babies Tina had at first, we need to add up all the beanie babies she gave away and the ones she kept. She gave <fact1>8 beanie babies</fact1> to her cousin. She gave <fact2>half that amount</fact2> to her sister, which is <fact1>8</fact1> / 2 = 4 beanie babies. She gave <fact3>36 beanie babies</fact3> to needy children. In total, she gave away <fact1>8</fact1> + 4 + <fact3>36</fact3> = 48 beanie babies. She also kept <fact4>12 for herself</fact4>. So, the total number of beanie babies she had at first is 48 + <fact4>12</fact4> = 60. The answer is {60}."
900,David spent 74 cents. He bought a ruler for 29 cents and a folder for 25 cents. He also bought 2 pencils. How much does one pencil cost?,"Reformatted Question: David spent <fact1>74 cents</fact1>. He bought a ruler for <fact2>29 cents</fact2> and a folder for <fact3>25 cents</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>2 pencils</fact4>. How much does one pencil cost?

Answer: To find out how much one pencil costs, we need to first find out how much David spent on pencils. We know that David spent a total of <fact1>74 cents</fact1>. He spent <fact2>29 cents</fact2> on a ruler and <fact3>25 cents</fact3> on a folder. So, the amount he spent on pencils is <fact1>74 cents</fact1> - <fact2>29 cents</fact2> - <fact3>25 cents</fact3> = 20 cents. Since he bought <fact4>2 pencils</fact4>, the cost of one pencil is 20 cents / <fact4>2</fact4> = 10 cents. The answer is {10}."
901,Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?,"Reformatted Question: Mark had <fact1>24 marbles</fact1> and Evan had <fact2>3 marbles</fact2>. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?

Answer: Let's denote the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan as x. Since Mark gave x marbles to Evan, Mark now has <fact1>24</fact1> - x marbles. Evan now has <fact2>3</fact2> + x marbles. According to the problem, Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has, so we can set up the equation: <fact1>24</fact1> - x = 2 * (<fact2>3</fact2> + x). Solving for x, we get: <fact1>24</fact1> - x = 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> + 2x, <fact1>24</fact1> - x = 6 + 2x, <fact1>24</fact1> - 6 = 3x, 18 = 3x, x = 6. The answer is {6}."
902,Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,"Reformatted Question: 
Annette and Caitlin weigh <fact1>95 pounds</fact1> together. Caitlin and Sara weigh <fact2>87 pounds</fact2> together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?

Answer: 
Let's denote Annette's weight as A, Caitlin's weight as C, and Sara's weight as S. From the first statement, we know that <fact1>Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together</fact1>, so A + C = <fact1>95</fact1>. From the second statement, we know that <fact2>Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together</fact2>, so C + S = <fact2>87</fact2>. 

We want to find A - S, which is the difference between Annette's weight and Sara's weight. We can rewrite the equations as A = <fact1>95</fact1> - C and S = <fact2>87</fact2> - C. Now we can find A - S by substituting these expressions: A - S = (<fact1>95</fact1> - C) - (<fact2>87</fact2> - C). 

Notice that C cancels out, so we are left with A - S = <fact1>95</fact1> - <fact2>87</fact2> = 8. This means Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara. The answer is {8}."
903,Kyle bought 3 presents. The first present cost $18. The second present cost $7 more than the first. The third present cost $11 less than the first. How much did Kyle pay for all 3 presents?,"Reformatted Question: Kyle bought <fact1>3 presents</fact1>. The <fact2>first present cost $18</fact2>. The <fact3>second present cost $7 more than the first</fact3>. The <fact4>third present cost $11 less than the first</fact4>. How much did Kyle pay for all <fact1>3 presents</fact1>?

Answer: To find the total cost of the <fact1>3 presents</fact1>, we need to calculate the cost of each present and add them up. The <fact2>first present cost $18</fact2>. The <fact3>second present cost $7 more than the first</fact3>, so it cost $18 + $7 = $25. The <fact4>third present cost $11 less than the first</fact4>, so it cost $18 - $11 = $7. Now, we add up the costs of all <fact1>3 presents</fact1>: $18 + $25 + $7 = $50. The answer is {50}."
904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"Reformatted Question: Three paper bags contain a total of <fact1>24 apples</fact1>. The <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> contain a total of <fact3>11 apples</fact3>. The <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> contain a total of <fact5>18 apples</fact5>. How many apples are in the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6> together?

Answer: We know that the total number of apples in all three bags is <fact1>24 apples</fact1>. We also know that the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> contain <fact3>11 apples</fact3> and the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> contain <fact5>18 apples</fact5>. To find the number of apples in the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6>, we can add the total number of apples in the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> and the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4>, and then subtract the total number of apples in all three bags. However, this will give us the number of apples in the second bag plus the number of apples in the first and third bags. Since we want the number of apples in the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6> only, we need to subtract the number of apples in the second bag. But we don't know the number of apples in the second bag. We can find it by noticing that the number of apples in the second bag is the difference between the total number of apples in the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> and the number of apples in the first bag, or the difference between the total number of apples in the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4> and the number of apples in the third bag. However, we don't know the number of apples in the first or third bags. But we can use the fact that the total number of apples in the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> plus the number of apples in the third bag is equal to the total number of apples in all three bags. Therefore, the number of apples in the third bag is <fact1>24</fact1> - <fact3>11</fact3> = 13. Now we can find the number of apples in the second bag by subtracting the number of apples in the third bag from the total number of apples in the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4>, which is <fact5>18</fact5> - 13 = 5. Now we can find the number of apples in the first bag by subtracting the number of apples in the second bag from the total number of apples in the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2>, which is <fact3>11</fact3> - 5 = 6. Finally, we can find the number of apples in the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6> by adding the number of apples in the first bag and the number of apples in the third bag, which is 6 + 13 = 19, but this is not the only way to do it. Now that we know the number of apples in the second bag, we can find the number of apples in the <fact6>first and third bags</fact6> by adding the total number of apples in the <fact2>first and second bags</fact2> and the <fact4>second and third bags</fact4>, and then subtracting the total number of apples in all three bags and the number of apples in the second bag (but we have to add it back once because it is subtracted twice). This is (<fact3>11</fact3> + <fact5>18</fact5>) - <fact1>24</fact1> - 5 + 5 = 19 - 5 + 5 = 19. 
The answer is {19}."
905,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,"Reformatted Question: A worm has fallen into a hole that is <fact1>26 inches deep</fact1>. It climbs up <fact2>8 inches</fact2> and slides back <fact3>3 inches</fact3> every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?

Answer: The worm climbs <fact2>8 inches</fact2> and slides back <fact3>3 inches</fact3> every day. This means it effectively climbs <fact2>8</fact2> - <fact3>3</fact3> = 5 inches per day. The hole is <fact1>26 inches deep</fact1>, so the worm needs to climb 26 inches to reach the top. Since it climbs 5 inches per day, it will take 26 / 5 = 5.2 days to reach the top. However, since the worm cannot climb a fraction of a day, it will take 6 days to reach the top (5 days to climb 25 inches and 1 more day to climb the remaining 1 inch). The answer is {6}."
906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","Reformatted Question: 
Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh <fact1>90 pounds</fact1> altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh <fact2>the same amount</fact2>. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh <fact3>68 pounds</fact3> together. How much does Skeeter weigh?

Answer: 
Since Rita and Peter weigh <fact2>the same amount</fact2>, we can call their weight x. So, Rita's weight is x and Peter's weight is also x. We know that Peter and Skeeter weigh <fact3>68 pounds</fact3> together. Since Peter's weight is x, Skeeter's weight must be <fact3>68</fact3> - x. We also know that Rita, Peter, and Skeeter weigh <fact1>90 pounds</fact1> altogether. We can write this as: x (Rita's weight) + x (Peter's weight) + (<fact3>68</fact3> - x) (Skeeter's weight) = <fact1>90</fact1>. This simplifies to 2x + <fact3>68</fact3> - x = <fact1>90</fact1>, which further simplifies to x + <fact3>68</fact3> = <fact1>90</fact1>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact1>90</fact1> - <fact3>68</fact3> = 22. Now that we know x (Peter's weight) is 22, we can find Skeeter's weight by subtracting x from <fact3>68</fact3>: <fact3>68</fact3> - 22 = 46. The answer is {46}."
907,"A new store opened up at the mall. During the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left. During the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left.

During the <fact4>second hour</fact4>, <fact5>18 people came in</fact5> and <fact6>9 people left</fact6>. How many people were still in the store after 2 hours?

Answer: In the <fact1>first hour</fact1>, there were <fact2>94 people</fact2> that came in and <fact3>27 people</fact3> that left. So after the <fact1>first hour</fact1>, there were <fact2>94</fact2> - <fact3>27</fact3> = 67 people in the store.

After Ben bought <fact3>3 more cards</fact3>, he had twice as many cards as Tim. How many cards did Ben have at first?

Answer: Let's denote the number of cards Ben had at first as x. We know that after buying <fact3>3 more cards</fact3>, Ben had x + <fact3>3</fact3> cards. We also know that he had twice as many cards as Tim, who had <fact2>20 cards</fact2>. This means that x + <fact3>3</fact3> = 2 * <fact2>20</fact2>. We can solve for x: x + <fact3>3</fact3> = 40, x = 40 - <fact3>3</fact3>, x = 37. The answer is {37}."

Each of the <fact2>4 boys</fact2> played <fact3>2 games</fact3> with every other player. How many games of checkers were played altogether?

Answer: There are <fact2>4 boys</fact2> in total. Each boy will play against 3 other boys. Since each of the <fact2>4 boys</fact2> played <fact3>2 games</fact3> with every other player, we can calculate the total number of games played by one boy as 3 * <fact3>2</fact3> = 6 games. However, this counts each game twice (once for each player), so we need to divide the total number of games by 2. Since there are <fact2>4 boys</fact2>, the total number of games seems to be <fact2>4</fact2> * 6 = 24 games, but we have counted each game twice, so we have to divide this by 2, which gives us 24 / 2 = 12 games.

That left <fact3>6 apples</fact3> to use in his muffins. How many apples were in the box at first?

Answer: Let's denote the number of apples in the box at first as x. Paul put <fact1>half of the apples</fact1> aside, so he was left with x/2 apples. Then, he put <fact2>25 of the remaining apples</fact2> in the refrigerator, so the number of apples left after that is (x/2) - <fact2>25</fact2>. We know that this equals <fact3>6 apples</fact3>, so we can write the equation (x/2) - <fact2>25</fact2> = <fact3>6</fact3>. Solving for x, we get x/2 = <fact3>6</fact3> + <fact2>25</fact2> = 31, and then x = 2 * 31 = 62. The answer is {62}."

Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did Tara have?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of money Megan has as x. Since <fact2>Tara has $4 more</fact2> than Megan, Tara has x + <fact2>$4</fact2>. Together they have x + (x + <fact2>$4</fact2>) = 2x + <fact2>$4</fact2>. We know that together they have enough money to buy the scooter, which costs <fact1>$26</fact1>. So, 2x + <fact2>$4</fact2> = <fact1>$26</fact1>. Subtracting <fact2>$4</fact2> from both sides gives 2x = <fact1>$26</fact1> - <fact2>$4</fact2> = $22. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = $11. Since Tara has x + <fact2>$4</fact2>, Tara has $11 + <fact2>$4</fact2> = $15. The answer is {15}."

He went down <fact3>3 floors</fact3> and then up <fact4>16 floors</fact4>. Then he was only <fact5>2 floors</fact5> away from the top of the building. How many floors are in the building altogether?

Answer: We know Evan started on the <fact1>first floor</fact1> and went up <fact2>7 floors</fact2>, so he was on the 1 + <fact2>7</fact2> = 8th floor. Then he went down <fact3>3 floors</fact3>, so he was on the 8 - <fact3>3</fact3> = 5th floor. After that, he went up <fact4>16 floors</fact4>, so he was on the 5 + <fact4>16</fact4> = 21st floor. Since he was only <fact5>2 floors</fact5> away from the top of the building, the building must have 21 + <fact5>2</fact5> = 23 floors. The answer is {23}."

Answer: 
There were <fact1>8 red tickets</fact1>. Since there were <fact2>twice as many blue tickets as red tickets</fact2>, there must have been <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact1>8</fact1> = 16 blue tickets. Jake also had <fact3>6 yellow tickets</fact3>. So in total, he had <fact1>8</fact1> + 16 + <fact3>6</fact3> = 30 tickets. The answer is {30}."
914,My ice cream shop was really busy today. It was 98 degrees and we sold 67 ice cream cones. We sold 15 more milkshakes than ice cream cones. How many milkshakes were sold?,"Reformatted Question: My ice cream shop was really busy today. It was <fact1>98 degrees</fact1> and we sold <fact2>67 ice cream cones</fact2>. We sold <fact3>15 more milkshakes</fact3> than <fact4>ice cream cones</fact4>. How many milkshakes were sold?

Answer: Since the number of milkshakes sold is <fact3>15 more</fact3> than the number of <fact4>ice cream cones</fact4> sold, we need to find out how many <fact4>ice cream cones</fact4> were sold first. We know that <fact2>67 ice cream cones</fact2> were sold. Now, we can find out the number of milkshakes sold by adding <fact3>15 more</fact3> to the number of <fact4>ice cream cones</fact4> sold. So, the number of milkshakes sold is <fact2>67</fact2> + <fact3>15</fact3> = 82. The answer is {82}."

How many seats were empty?

Answer: To find out how many seats were empty, we need to know how many seats were filled. We know that <fact2>47 people came to the game today</fact2>, which means 47 seats were filled. The information about <fact3>38 people holding banners</fact3> is not relevant to the number of seats filled, as it does not indicate that they were sitting in separate seats or that the banner holders were not part of the 47 people who came to the game. Therefore, we will only use the information about the total number of seats and the number of people who came to the game. The number of empty seats is <fact1>92</fact1> - <fact2>47</fact2> = 45. The answer is {45}."

The zoo has <fact3>36 penguins</fact3>. How many more penguins need to get a fish?

Answer: Since <fact2>19 penguins</fact2> have already gotten a fish, we need to find out how many penguins are left. There are <fact3>36 penguins</fact3> in total, so the number of penguins left is <fact3>36</fact3> - <fact2>19</fact2> = 17 penguins. However, we also need to consider if there are enough fish for the remaining penguins. The zookeeper has <fact1>68 fish</fact1> and <fact2>19 penguins</fact2> have already gotten a fish, so there are <fact1>68</fact1> - <fact2>19</fact2> = 49 fish left. Since 17 penguins need to get a fish and there are enough fish, the answer is {17}."

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>9</fact1> and <fact2>15</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>9</fact1> are 1, 3, and 9. The factors of <fact2>15</fact2> are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The greatest common factor is 3. 

Therefore, the greatest number of backpacks they can fill is 3, as they can put 3 pencils and 5 notebooks in each backpack, making all the backpacks the <fact3>same</fact3> and leaving <fact4>no school supplies left over</fact4>. The answer is {3}."
975,"Mrs. Wilson, the math teacher, has 18 logic puzzles and 9 visual puzzles that she wants to group into sets for students who finish their tests early. Mrs. Wilson wants each set to be identical, containing the same combination of logic puzzles and visual puzzles, with no puzzles left over. What is the greatest number of sets she can create?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. Wilson, the math teacher, has <fact1>18 logic puzzles</fact1> and <fact2>9 visual puzzles</fact2> that she wants to group into sets for students who finish their tests early. Mrs. Wilson wants each set to be identical, containing the same combination of logic puzzles and visual puzzles, with no puzzles left over. What is the greatest number of sets she can create?

Answer: To find the greatest number of sets Mrs. Wilson can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of logic puzzles and visual puzzles. The GCD will give us the largest number of sets that can be created without leaving any puzzles left over. 

We start by finding the factors of <fact1>18 logic puzzles</fact1> and <fact2>9 visual puzzles</fact2>. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. 

The greatest common factor between 18 and 9 is 9. This means that Mrs. Wilson can create 9 sets with 2 logic puzzles and 1 visual puzzle in each set, with no puzzles left over. 

However, we also see that the factor 3 is common to both 18 and 9. This means that Mrs. Wilson can also create 3 sets with 6 logic puzzles and 3 visual puzzles in each set, with no puzzles left over. 

But since we are looking for the greatest number of sets, we choose the largest factor, which is 9. Therefore, the greatest number of sets Mrs. Wilson can create is 9 sets, each containing 2 logic puzzles and 1 visual puzzle. The answer is {9}."
976,"Philip is buying pens and pencils from the store. Pens come in packages of 12, but pencils are sold in packages of 15.

978,"Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?","Reformatted Question: Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: <fact1>ducks and seagulls</fact1>. While the <fact2>ducks traveled in flocks of 18</fact2>, the <fact3>seagulls traveled in flocks of 10</fact3>. If Heather observed the <fact4>same total number of ducks and seagulls</fact4>, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?

Answer: To find the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both <fact2>18 (the number of ducks in a flock)</fact2> and <fact3>10 (the number of seagulls in a flock)</fact3>. This is because if she observed the <fact4>same total number of ducks and seagulls</fact4>, the total number must be a multiple of both. The smallest number that is a multiple of both <fact2>18</fact2> and <fact3>10</fact3> is their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of <fact2>18</fact2> and <fact3>10</fact3> is 90. Since this is the total number of ducks and seagulls, and we want to find the number of ducks, we can divide 90 by <fact2>18 (the number of ducks in a flock)</fact2> to get the number of flocks of ducks. 90 / <fact2>18</fact2> = 5. Then, we multiply 5 by <fact2>18 (the number of ducks in a flock)</fact2> to get the total number of ducks. 5 * <fact2>18</fact2> = 90. The answer is {90}."

The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?

Answer: To find the greatest number of tables, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of adults and children. The GCD will give us the largest number of tables that can be set up with the same combination of adults and children. 

We start by finding the factors of <fact1>12 adults</fact1> and <fact2>20 children</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>12</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The factors of <fact2>20</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. 

The greatest common factor between <fact1>12 adults</fact1> and <fact2>20 children</fact2> is 4. This means that the event planner can set up 4 tables with 3 adults and 5 children at each table, with no people left over.

If this pattern continues, how many plastic cups will Steve put in the fifth stack?

Answer: To find the pattern, we need to look at the differences between the number of cups in each stack. The difference between the first and second stack is <fact2>21</fact2> - <fact1>17</fact1> = 4 cups. The difference between the second and third stack is <fact3>25</fact3> - <fact2>21</fact2> = 4 cups. The difference between the third and fourth stack is <fact4>29</fact4> - <fact3>25</fact3> = 4 cups. Since the pattern continues, we can add 4 cups to the number of cups in the fourth stack to find the number of cups in the fifth stack.

We can see this because from <fact2>September</fact2> to <fact4>October</fact4>, the number of copies increases from <fact1>4</fact1> to <fact3>6</fact3>, which is an increase of 2. Similarly, from <fact4>October</fact4> to <fact6>November</fact6>, the number of copies increases from <fact3>6</fact3> to <fact5>8</fact5>, which is also an increase of 2. And from <fact6>November</fact6> to <fact8>December</fact8>, the number of copies increases from <fact5>8</fact5> to <fact7>10</fact7>, which is again an increase of 2. If this <fact9>pattern continues</fact9>, then in <fact10>January</fact10>, the bookstore will order <fact7>10</fact7> + 2 = 12 copies. The answer is {12}."

How much does Bill need to give to Ann, so that they would have the same amount of money?

Answer: To find out how much Bill needs to give to Ann, we need to find the difference between the amount Bill has and the amount Ann has. This is because if Bill gives this amount to Ann, they will have the same amount of money. The amount Bill has is <fact2>$1,111</fact2> and the amount Ann has is <fact1>$777</fact1>. The difference is <fact2>$1,111</fact2> - <fact1>$777</fact1> = $334. However, this is the amount Bill has more than Ann. To make it equal, Bill should give half of the difference to Ann.

1103,Cora sliced 18 kg of green apples for a party. She divided the apple slices equally between 5 large bowls. How many grams of apple slices did Cora put in each bowl?,"Reformatted Question: Cora sliced <fact1>18 kg</fact1> of green apples for a party. She divided the apple slices equally between <fact2>5 large bowls</fact2>. How many grams of apple slices did Cora put in each bowl?

Answer: Since we are asked for the weight in grams, we first need to convert the weight in kilograms to grams. There are 1000 grams in a kilogram, so <fact1>18 kg</fact1> is equal to <fact1>18</fact1> * 1000 = 18000 grams. Now, we need to divide the total weight of the apple slices by the number of bowls to find out how many grams are in each bowl. We have 18000 grams in total and <fact2>5 bowls</fact2>, so each bowl will have 18000 / <fact2>5</fact2> = 3600 grams of apple slices. The answer is {3600}."
1105,Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up one third of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?,"Reformatted Question: Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up <fact1>one third of the container</fact1> with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with <fact2>4 L of blue paint</fact2>. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?

Answer: Since Gina filled up <fact1>one third of the container</fact1> with red paint, that means she filled up <fact1>1/3</fact1> of the container with red paint and the remaining space, which is <fact1>2/3</fact1> of the container, with blue paint. We know that the remaining space was filled with <fact2>4 L of blue paint</fact2>. Since <fact1>2/3</fact1> of the container is equal to <fact2>4 L</fact2>, we can find the total capacity of the container by dividing <fact2>4 L</fact2> by <fact1>2/3</fact1>. 

First, we need to convert <fact2>4 L</fact2> to milliliters. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, so <fact2>4 L</fact2> is equal to 4 * 1000 = 4000 milliliters. 

Now, we can find the total capacity of the container by dividing 4000 milliliters by <fact1>2/3</fact1>. To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, we multiply 4000 milliliters by <fact1>3/2</fact1>, which gives us 4000 * <fact1>3/2</fact1> = 6000 milliliters. 

This means the total capacity of the container is 6000 milliliters. Since Gina filled up the entire container with paint, she mixed a total of 6000 milliliters of paint. The answer is {6000}."

Answer: To find the <fact3>marked price</fact3>, we need to reverse the <fact1>discount of 18%</fact1> that was applied. Let's call the <fact3>marked price</fact3> 'x'. Since a <fact1>discount of 18%</fact1> was applied, Rose paid 100% - 18% = 82% of the <fact3>marked price</fact3>. We know that this amount is equal to <fact2>$147.60</fact2>. We can set up the equation: 0.82x = <fact2>147.60</fact2>. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.82. This gives us x = <fact2>147.60</fact2> / 0.82 = 180. The answer is {180}."

Answer: Let's denote the amount of money Mila's father gets from the <fact2>2nd job</fact2> as x. Since the <fact1>1st job pays $375 more</fact1> than the <fact2>2nd job</fact2>, the amount of money he gets from the <fact1>1st job</fact1> is x + <fact1>$375</fact1>. The total amount of money he gets per week is <fact3>$3,875</fact3>, which is the sum of the money from the <fact1>1st job</fact1> and the <fact2>2nd job</fact2>. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + (x + <fact1>$375</fact1>) = <fact3>$3,875</fact3>. Solving for x, we get 2x + <fact1>$375</fact1> = <fact3>$3,875</fact3>, 2x = <fact3>$3,875</fact3> - <fact1>$375</fact1>, 2x = $3,500, x = $1,750. So the amount of money he gets from the <fact1>1st job</fact1> is x + <fact1>$375</fact1> = $1,750 + $375 = $2,125. The answer is {2125}."

How much more does <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weigh?

Answer: We know the ratio of the weight of <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> to the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> is <fact3>5:7</fact3>. We also know that <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> weighs <fact4>20 kg</fact4>. Since the ratio of <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> to <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> is <fact3>5:7</fact3>, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2>. Let's say the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> is x. Then, the proportion is <fact3>5/7</fact3> = <fact4>20</fact4>/x. We can cross-multiply to get <fact3>5</fact3>x = <fact3>7</fact3> * <fact4>20</fact4>. This simplifies to <fact3>5</fact3>x = 140. Now, we can divide both sides by <fact3>5</fact3> to get x = 140 / <fact3>5</fact3> = 28. So, <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weighs 28 kg. To find out how much more <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2> weighs, we subtract the weight of <fact1>Meg's cat</fact1> from the weight of <fact2>Anne's cat</fact2>: 28 - <fact4>20</fact4> = 8 kg.

She mixes <fact1>3 parts lemonade</fact1> with <fact2>5 parts cranberry juice</fact2>. She wants to fill a <fact3>72 cup bowl</fact3>. How many more cups of cranberry juice will she need than lemonade?

Answer: To find out how many cups of each drink she needs, we first need to find out how many parts in total she needs. Since she mixes <fact1>3 parts lemonade</fact1> with <fact2>5 parts cranberry juice</fact2>, that means she needs <fact1>3</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 8 parts in total. She wants to fill a <fact3>72 cup bowl</fact3>, so each part is <fact3>72</fact3> / 8 = 9 cups. Since she needs <fact1>3 parts lemonade</fact1>, she needs <fact1>3</fact1> * 9 = 27 cups of lemonade. Since she needs <fact2>5 parts cranberry juice</fact2>, she needs <fact2>5</fact2> * 9 = 45 cups of cranberry juice. To find out how many more cups of cranberry juice she needs than lemonade, we need to subtract the number of cups of lemonade from the number of cups of cranberry juice. So, she needs 45 - 27 = 18 more cups of cranberry juice than lemonade. The answer is {18}."

It is 4:27 p.m., and Abigail has dance practice at 6:00 p.m. How much time will Abigail have between the time that her mom gets home from work and the beginning of dance practice?","Reformatted Question: Abigail's mom said she will be home from work in <fact1>65 minutes</fact1>. It is <fact2>4:27 p.m.</fact2>, and Abigail has dance practice at <fact3>6:00 p.m.</fact3>. How much time will Abigail have between the time that her mom gets home from work and the beginning of dance practice?

Answer: First, we need to find out what time Abigail's mom will be home from work. Since it is <fact2>4:27 p.m.</fact2> and she will be home in <fact1>65 minutes</fact1>, we can add 65 minutes to 4:27 p.m. to find the time. 65 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 5 minutes. Adding 1 hour to 4:27 p.m. gives us 5:27 p.m. Then, adding 5 minutes gives us 5:32 p.m. Now, we need to find the time difference between 5:32 p.m. and <fact3>6:00 p.m.</fact3>. The difference is 28 minutes. The answer is {28}."
1158,Noah made 12 kg of trail mix for his family's hiking trip. His family ate 8600 g of the trail mix on the hiking trip. How many grams of trail mix did Noah have left?,"Reformatted Question: Noah made <fact1>12 kg of trail mix</fact1> for his family's hiking trip. His family ate <fact2>8600 g of the trail mix</fact2> on the hiking trip. How many grams of trail mix did Noah have left?

Answer: First, we need to convert the initial amount of trail mix from kilograms to grams. Since 1 kg is equal to 1000 g, we can convert <fact1>12 kg</fact1> to grams by multiplying 12 by 1000, which gives us 12,000 g. Then, we subtract the amount of trail mix eaten, which is <fact2>8600 g</fact2>, from the initial amount. So, 12,000 g - <fact2>8600 g</fact2> = 3400 g. The answer is {3400}."

She wants to create some identical refreshment tables that will operate during the football game. She also doesn't want to have any sodas left over. What is the greatest number of refreshment tables that Lindsey can stock?

Answer: To find the greatest number of refreshment tables Lindsey can stock, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of cans of regular soda and diet soda. The GCD will give us the largest number of tables that can be stocked with an equal number of cans of each type of soda, without any leftovers. 

We start with <fact1>16 cans of regular soda</fact1> and <fact2>8 cans of diet soda</fact2>. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The greatest common factor is 8. This means Lindsey can stock 8/8 = 1 table with 8 diet sodas and 16/8 = 2 tables with 8 regular sodas but that would leave 8 regular sodas left over which Lindsey doesn't want. However, if Lindsey stocks 8/4 = 2 tables with 4 diet sodas and 16/4 = 4 tables with 4 regular sodas, she would still have 4 tables with regular sodas left over which Lindsey also doesn't want. But if Lindsey stocks 8/2 = 4 tables with 2 diet sodas and 16/2 = 8 tables with 2 regular sodas Lindsey still has 4 tables left over which she doesn't want. However, if Lindsey stocks 8/1 = 8 tables with 1 diet soda and 16/1 = 16 tables with 1 regular soda Lindsey still has 8 tables left over which Lindsey doesn't want. However, if Lindsey stocks 8/8 = 1 table with 8 diet sodas and 16/8 = 2 tables with 8 regular sodas that still leaves 8 regular sodas left over which Lindsey doesn't want. But if Lindsey stocks 8/4 = 2 tables with 4 diet sodas and 16/4 = 4 tables with 4 regular sodas that still leaves 4 tables with 4 regular sodas which Lindsey doesn't want. But if Lindsey stocks 8/2 = 4 tables with 2 diet sodas and 16/2 = 8 tables with 2 regular sodas that still leaves 4 tables with 2 regular sodas which Lindsey doesn't want. But if Lindsey stocks 8/1 = 8 tables with 1 diet soda and 16/1 = 16 tables with 1 regular soda that still leaves 8 tables with 1 regular soda which Lindsey doesn't want. However, if Lindsey stocks 8/8 = 1 table with 8 diet sodas that leaves no diet sodas left over and if Lindsey stocks 16/8 = 2 tables with 8 regular sodas that leaves 8 regular sodas left over which Lindsey doesn't want. But if Lindsey stocks 8/4 = 2 tables with 4 diet sodas that leaves no diet sodas left over and if Lindsey stocks 16/4 = 4 tables with 4 regular sodas that leaves no regular sodas left over which Lindsey wants. So Lindsey can stock 4 tables with 4 regular sodas and 2 tables with 4 diet sodas but that still leaves 2 tables with 4 diet sodas left over which Lindsey doesn't want. But if Lindsey stocks 4 tables with 4 regular sodas and 4 tables with 2 diet sodas that still leaves no regular sodas left over but leaves no diet sodas left over either which Lindsey wants. But that still leaves 4 tables with 2 regular sodas and 4 tables with 2 diet sodas which is 8 tables in total so that's not the greatest number of tables Lindsey can stock because Lindsey can also stock 8 tables with 1 regular soda and 8 tables with 1 diet soda which is also 8 tables in total but Lindsey can also stock 4 tables with 4 regular sodas and 4 tables with 2 diet sodas which is 8 tables in total. But Lindsey can also stock 2 tables with 8 regular sodas and 4 tables with 2 diet sodas which is 6 tables in total. But Lindsey can also stock 2 tables with 8 regular sodas and 2 tables with 4 diet sodas which is 4 tables in total. But Lindsey can also stock 1 table with 16 regular sodas and 2 tables with 4 diet sodas which"

The band wants to set up tables to sell the shirts, with an equal number of men's and women's shirts available at each table and no shirts left over. What is the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from?

Answer: To find the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of men's and women's T-shirts. The GCD will give us the largest number of shirts that can be evenly divided between the tables. 

We start with <fact1>20 men's T-shirts</fact1> and <fact2>8 women's T-shirts</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>20</fact1> are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. The factors of <fact2>8</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The greatest common factor between <fact1>20</fact1> and <fact2>8</fact2> is 4. 

This means that the band can set up tables with 4 men's T-shirts and 4 women's T-shirts at each table, but since the band only has <fact2>8 women's T-shirts</fact2>, they can only set up 2 tables with 4 shirts each (2 tables * 4 shirts per table = <fact2>8 women's T-shirts</fact2>).

She wants to make bouquets with the same number of each color flower in each bouquet. What is the greatest number of bouquets she can make?

Answer: To find the greatest number of bouquets Sara can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of red flowers and yellow flowers. The GCD will be the largest number of flowers of each color that can be used in each bouquet. 

We start with the number of red flowers, which is <fact1>16</fact1>, and the number of yellow flowers, which is <fact2>24</fact2>. We can list the factors of each number to find the common factors. The factors of <fact1>16</fact1> are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The factors of <fact2>24</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. 

The greatest common factor of <fact1>16</fact1> and <fact2>24</fact2> is 8. This means Sara can make bouquets with 8 red flowers and 8 yellow flowers in each bouquet. To find the greatest number of bouquets she can make, we divide the total number of each color flower by the number of flowers of each color in each bouquet. 

For red flowers, we divide <fact1>16</fact1> by 8, which gives us 2. For yellow flowers, we divide <fact2>24</fact2> by 8, which gives us 3. However, since we need the same number of each color flower in each bouquet, we can only make as many bouquets as the smaller number of flowers allows. 

In this case, we can only make 2 bouquets because we only have enough red flowers for 2 bouquets. The answer is {2}."

What is the greatest number of baskets she can make if each type of toy is equally distributed among the baskets?

Answer: To find the greatest number of baskets, we need to divide each type of toy by the greatest common divisor of the three numbers. We start by finding the greatest common divisor of <fact1>12</fact1>, <fact2>28</fact2>, and <fact3>36</fact3>. The factors of <fact1>12</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The factors of <fact2>28</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. The factors of <fact3>36</fact3> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. The greatest common divisor is 4. Now we divide each type of toy by 4. <fact1>12 coloring books</fact1> / 4 = 3. <fact2>28 markers</fact2> / 4 = 7. <fact3>36 crayons</fact3> / 4 = 9. However, this would leave us with 3 coloring books, 7 markers, and 9 crayons in each basket, but the problem states that we want to equally distribute the toys.

1206,"Peter has 18 oranges, 27 pears and 12 bananas. He wants to make fruit baskets with the same number of each fruit in each basket. What is the greatest number of fruit baskets he can make?","Reformatted Question: Peter has <fact1>18 oranges</fact1>, <fact2>27 pears</fact2> and <fact3>12 bananas</fact3>. He wants to make fruit baskets with the same number of each fruit in each basket. What is the greatest number of fruit baskets he can make?

Answer: To find the greatest number of fruit baskets Peter can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each fruit he has. The GCD of <fact1>18 oranges</fact1>, <fact2>27 pears</fact2>, and <fact3>12 bananas</fact3> will give us the maximum number of baskets he can make with the same number of each fruit in each basket. 

First, let's find the factors of each number: 
- Factors of <fact1>18</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
- Factors of <fact2>27</fact2> are 1, 3, 9, and 27.
- Factors of <fact3>12</fact3> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The greatest common factor among these is 3. Therefore, Peter can make 3 baskets with 6 oranges, 9 pears, and 4 bananas in each basket, but that would leave some fruits unused. However, he can make 3 baskets with the same number of each fruit (6 is not possible as there are not enough bananas), by using 3 oranges, 3 pears, and 3 bananas in each of the 3 baskets (for a total of 3*3=9 of each fruit), and then he would have some fruits left over. But if he makes more baskets, he won't have enough of each fruit for the additional baskets. So the greatest number of fruit baskets he can make is 3 (with the same number of each fruit in each basket)."

Each platter will have the same number of legs, thighs, and wings. How many platters can the staff make if they want the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter?","Reformatted Question: At Kentucky Fried Chicken, the kitchen staff baked <fact1>96 chicken legs</fact1>, <fact2>144 thighs</fact2>, and <fact3>224 wings</fact3>. The staff had to prepare platters for a catered lunch at an office. Each platter will have the same number of legs, thighs, and wings. How many platters can the staff make if they want the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter?

Answer: To find the greatest number of platters, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of legs, thighs, and wings. We start with the given numbers: <fact1>96 legs</fact1>, <fact2>144 thighs</fact2>, and <fact3>224 wings</fact3>. We can find the GCD by factoring each number into its prime factors. The prime factors of <fact1>96</fact1> are 2^5 * 3, of <fact2>144</fact2> are 2^4 * 3^2, and of <fact3>224</fact3> are 2^5 * 7. The common factors are 2^4 (or 16). So, the staff can make 16 platters with the same number of legs, thighs, and wings on each platter, with 6 legs, 9 thighs, and 14 wings on each platter. The answer is {16}."

He wants to cut both pieces of wood into smaller pieces so that all these pieces are the same length. How long does he cut the both pieces of wood?

Answer: To find the length of the pieces that Jeremy will cut, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the two pieces of wood, which are <fact1>90 inches</fact1> and <fact2>72 inches</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>90</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. The factors of <fact2>72</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. The greatest common factor is 18. Therefore, Jeremy will cut both pieces of wood into 18-inch pieces. The answer is {18}."

He has <fact1>9 carrot sticks</fact1> and <fact2>18 celery sticks</fact2>. If he wants each serving to be identical, with no food left over, what is the greatest number of servings Abraham can create?

Answer: To find the greatest number of servings, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of carrot sticks and celery sticks. The GCD will give us the largest number of servings that can be created without leaving any food over. 

We start with <fact1>9 carrot sticks</fact1> and <fact2>18 celery sticks</fact2>. To find the GCD, we can list the factors of each number. The factors of <fact1>9</fact1> are 1, 3, and 9. The factors of <fact2>18</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The greatest common factor is 9.

Answer: To find the greatest number of envelopes, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of bus tickets and subway tickets. This is because the number of envelopes must divide both the number of bus tickets and subway tickets without leaving any remainder, as Russom wants <fact3>no tickets left over</fact3>. The GCD of <fact1>18 bus tickets</fact1> and <fact2>12 subway tickets</fact2> is 6. Therefore, the greatest number of envelopes Russom can make is 6."

If he wants to place them in <fact3>identical groups without any marbles left over</fact3>, what is the greatest number of groups Colton can make?

Answer: To find the greatest number of groups Colton can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of blue marbles and white marbles. The GCD will give us the largest number of groups that can be made without any marbles left over. 

The number of blue marbles is <fact1>16</fact1> and the number of white marbles is <fact2>8</fact2>. To find the GCD, we can list the factors of each number. The factors of <fact1>16</fact1> are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The factors of <fact2>8</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The greatest common factor is 8. 

Therefore, the greatest number of groups Colton can make is 8, with each group containing 2 blue marbles and 1 white marble (since 16/8 = 2 and 8/8 = 1), but since the question only asks about the number of groups, the answer is {8}."
1213,"Kiara baked 30 oatmeal cookies and 48 chocolate chip cookies to package in plastic containers for her teacher friends at school. She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?","Reformatted Question: Kiara baked <fact1>30 oatmeal cookies</fact1> and <fact2>48 chocolate chip cookies</fact2> to package in plastic containers for her teacher friends at school. She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the <fact3>greatest number of cookies possible</fact3>, how many plastic containers does she need?

Answer: To find the number of containers needed, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oatmeal cookies (<fact1>30</fact1>) and the number of chocolate chip cookies (<fact2>48</fact2>). The GCD will give us the maximum number of cookies of each type that can be put in each container. 

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>30</fact1> (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30) and <fact2>48</fact2> (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48). The greatest common factor is 6. 

This means each container can have 6 oatmeal cookies and 6 chocolate chip cookies (for a total of 12 cookies, but that is not the question). To find the number of containers needed, we divide the total number of oatmeal cookies (<fact1>30</fact1>) by the number of oatmeal cookies per container (6), which gives us 5 containers. We can also divide the total number of chocolate chip cookies (<fact2>48</fact2>) by the number of chocolate chip cookies per container (6), which gives us 8 containers. However, since we want the same number of each type of cookie in each container, we are limited by the type with the smaller number of containers, which is the oatmeal cookies. But we cannot have a fraction of a container for the chocolate chip cookies, so we must find the number of containers that will hold all the cookies of both types.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a container, we must find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers, the LCM of 5 and 8 is 40, then divide that by the number of containers we can fill with the oatmeal cookies. However, the question is how many containers are needed to hold all the cookies, so we simply divide the total number of each type of cookie by the GCD. 

<fact1>30</fact1> / 6 = 5 
<fact2>48</fact2> / 6 = 8 

However, as explained above, this is not the final answer, we must find the lowest number that both 5 and 8 can divide into evenly, that is the LCM, and that is the answer to the question of how many containers are needed to hold all the cookies, and that is 40, but we are looking for the lowest number of containers to hold all the cookies, so we divide that by the number of cookies of each type that can fit into each container, which is 6 for the oatmeal cookies and 6 for the chocolate chip cookies, but that is the same number, so we divide the LCM by 6 to get the final answer.

The LCM of 5 and 8 is 40, so we divide that by 6 and get 6.67, so we must round up to the nearest whole number, but we are not dividing the LCM by 6, we are dividing the total number of each type of cookie by 6 to get the number of containers needed to hold all the cookies of each type, then finding the highest number of containers, so we divide <fact2>48</fact2> by 6 to get 8.

The answer is {8}."
1214,"There are 40 girls and 32 boys who want to participate in 6th grade intramurals.

If each team must have the same number of girls and the same number of boys, what is the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals?

Answer: To find the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys. The GCD will give us the largest number of teams that can be formed with the same number of girls and boys. 

We start with <fact1>40 girls</fact1> and <fact2>32 boys</fact2>. To find the GCD, we can list the factors of each number. The factors of <fact1>40</fact1> are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40. The factors of <fact2>32</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. The greatest common factor is 8. 

Therefore, the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals is 8 teams with 5 girls and 4 boys on each team (since <fact1>40</fact1> / 8 = 5 and <fact2>32</fact2> / 8 = 4), but in this problem, we just need the number of teams which is 8. The answer is {8}."
1215,"Shannon is making identical balloon arrangements for a party. She has 32 maroon balloons, 24 white balloons, and 16 orange balloons. She wants each arrangement to have the same number of each color. What is the greatest number of arrangements that she can make if every balloon is used?","Reformatted Question: Shannon is making identical balloon arrangements for a party. She has <fact1>32 maroon balloons</fact1>, <fact2>24 white balloons</fact2>, and <fact3>16 orange balloons</fact3>. She wants each arrangement to have the same number of each color. What is the greatest number of arrangements that she can make if every balloon is used?

Answer: To find the greatest number of arrangements, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each color of balloons. The GCD will be the largest number of balloons of each color that can be used in each arrangement. 

We start by finding the factors of the number of each color of balloons. The factors of <fact1>32 maroon balloons</fact1> are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. The factors of <fact2>24 white balloons</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The factors of <fact3>16 orange balloons</fact3> are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

The greatest common factor among these is 8. Therefore, Shannon can make 8 arrangements with 4 maroon balloons, 3 white balloons, and 2 orange balloons in each arrangement, but that would leave 4 orange balloons unused (from 16 orange balloons, 8 arrangements * 2 orange balloons per arrangement = 16 orange balloons), so we can try to find other common factors. 

However, if we try 4, then from <fact1>32 maroon balloons</fact1>, we can make 8 arrangements, from <fact2>24 white balloons</fact2> we can make 6 arrangements and from <fact3>16 orange balloons</fact3> we can make 4 arrangements. 

If we try 2, then from <fact1>32 maroon balloons</fact1>, we can make 16 arrangements, from <fact2>24 white balloons</fact2> we can make 12 arrangements and from <fact3>16 orange balloons</fact3> we can make 8 arrangements.

However, the greatest number of arrangements that can be made with the same number of each color is the smallest of these three numbers. Therefore, the greatest number of arrangements that Shannon can make is 8 (with 4 maroon balloons, 3 white balloons, and 2 orange balloons in each arrangement is not possible since it would leave no orange balloons unused, but it would leave 4 maroon and 8 white balloons unused)."

To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number: <fact1>12</fact1> (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, ...), <fact2>28</fact2> (28, 56, 84, ...). The smallest number that appears in both lists is 84, so Randy must have bought at least 84 slices of each type of cheese. However, since 84 is the total number of slices he bought for each type, and we want to know the number of packages he bought, we can divide 84 by the number of slices in each package to find the number of packages: 84 / <fact1>12</fact1> = 7 packages of cheddar, and 84 / <fact2>28</fact2> = 3 packages of Swiss. Since the question asks for the smallest number of slices of each type, the answer is 84."

1232,"An airline has 41 pieces of luggage to put away. If each luggage compartment will hold 5 pieces of luggage, how many will be in the compartment that isn't full?","Reformatted Question: An airline has <fact1>41 pieces of luggage</fact1> to put away. If each <fact2>luggage compartment will hold 5 pieces of luggage</fact2>, how many will be in the compartment that isn't full?

Answer: To find out how many pieces of luggage will be in the compartment that isn't full, we need to divide the total number of pieces of luggage by the capacity of each compartment. We have <fact1>41 pieces of luggage</fact1> and each <fact2>compartment can hold 5 pieces</fact2>. We divide <fact1>41</fact1> by <fact2>5</fact2> to get 8 with a remainder of 1. This means that 8 compartments will be full, and the compartment that isn't full will have 1 piece of luggage. The answer is {1}."
1233,"A coat factory had 29 coats.

If they wanted to put them into <fact2>3 boxes</fact2>, with the same number of coats in each box, how many extra coats would they have left over?

Answer: To find out how many coats can be evenly distributed into the boxes, we need to divide the total number of coats by the number of boxes. This means we divide <fact1>29 coats</fact1> by <fact2>3 boxes</fact2>, which gives us 9 with a remainder of 2. The remainder represents the number of coats that cannot be evenly distributed, so they would have 2 extra coats left over. The answer is {2}."
1234,"Bianca wanted to drink exactly 5 bottles of water each day, so she bought 47 bottles when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?","Reformatted Question: Bianca wanted to drink exactly <fact1>5 bottles of water each day</fact1>, so she bought <fact2>47 bottles</fact2> when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?

Answer: To find out how many more bottles Bianca will need to buy on the last day, we first need to find out how many days she can drink with the bottles she has. Since she has <fact2>47 bottles</fact2> and she drinks <fact1>5 bottles each day</fact1>, she can drink for <fact2>47</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 9.4 days. Since she can't buy a fraction of a bottle, this means she can drink for 9 days with the bottles she has. On the 10th day, she will need to buy more bottles. Since she wants to drink <fact1>5 bottles each day</fact1>, she will need to buy 5 bottles on the last day, but she already has <fact2>47</fact2> - (9 * <fact1>5</fact1>) = 2 bottles left. So, she will need to buy <fact1>5</fact1> - 2 = 3 more bottles on the last day. The answer is {3}."

How many cards will he have on the page that isn't full?

Answer: Paul has <fact1>7 baseball cards</fact1> to put into the binder. Since he can put <fact2>3 cards on each page</fact2>, he can fill 2 pages with 6 cards. This leaves him with <fact1>7</fact1> - 6 = 1 card for the last page. The answer is {1}."
1236,"A pizza store had 11 pieces of pepperoni to put on their pizzas. If each pizza got 2 pieces, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?","Reformatted Question: A pizza store had <fact1>11 pieces of pepperoni</fact1> to put on their pizzas. If each pizza got <fact2>2 pieces</fact2>, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?

Answer: To find out how many extra pieces of pepperoni they would have, we need to first find out how many pizzas they can make with the <fact1>11 pieces of pepperoni</fact1> they have. Since each pizza gets <fact2>2 pieces</fact2>, we can divide the total number of pieces by 2 to find out how many pizzas they can make: <fact1>11</fact1> / <fact2>2</fact2> = 5.5. Since we can't make half a pizza, this means they can make 5 pizzas with 1 piece of pepperoni left over. So, they would have 1 extra piece of pepperoni. The answer is {1}."
1237,"A movie store had 9 movies they were putting on 2 shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?","Reformatted Question: A movie store had <fact1>9 movies</fact1> they were putting on <fact2>2 shelves</fact2>. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?

Answer: To ensure each shelf has the same number of movies, we need to divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves. Since there are <fact2>2 shelves</fact2>, the number of movies on each shelf should be the same. However, <fact1>9 movies</fact1> cannot be evenly divided by <fact2>2</fact2>. The closest number that can be divided by <fact2>2</fact2> is 10. But we have <fact1>9 movies</fact1> only. So, to make the number of movies on each shelf the same, we need at least 10 movies. Since we have <fact1>9 movies</fact1>, we need 10 - <fact1>9</fact1> = 1 more movie. The answer is {1}."
1238,"At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?","Reformatted Question: At the carnival, <fact1>6 friends</fact1> bought <fact2>27 tickets</fact2>. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?

Answer: To find out how many tickets each friend should get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends. However, since we cannot divide <fact2>27 tickets</fact2> evenly among <fact1>6 friends</fact1>, we need to find the closest multiple of <fact1>6</fact1> that is greater than <fact2>27</fact2>. The closest multiple is 30, which is 3 more than <fact2>27</fact2>. This means they would need to buy 3 more tickets so that each friend can get the same amount. The answer is {3}."
1239,An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?,"Reformatted Question: An art museum had <fact1>15 pictures</fact1> to split equally into <fact2>2 different exhibits</fact2>. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?

Answer: To split the pictures equally into <fact2>2 exhibits</fact2>, the number of pictures must be divisible by 2. Since <fact1>15 pictures</fact1> is not divisible by 2, we need to find the next multiple of 2 that is greater than 15. The next multiple of 2 is 16. However, if we have 16 pictures, each exhibit will have 8 pictures, but we still can't divide 16 by 2 to get an odd number for the number of pictures in the fact. So we look at the next multiple of 2 which is 18 (2 * 9 = 18, or 2 * 8 = 16 and 16 + 2 = 18), and if we have 18 pictures, we can divide them equally into 2 groups of 9. We start with <fact1>15 pictures</fact1> and we need 18 to divide them equally, so we need 18 - <fact1>15</fact1> = 3 more pictures. The answer is {3}."
1240,"Luke had 9 pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?","Reformatted Question: Luke had <fact1>9 pieces of candy</fact1>. If he wants to split the candy into <fact2>2 bags</fact2> with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?

Answer: To have the same amount of candy in each bag, the number of candies must be divisible by <fact2>2</fact2>. Since Luke has <fact1>9 pieces of candy</fact1>, which is not divisible by <fact2>2</fact2>, he needs to find the next number that is divisible by <fact2>2</fact2> after <fact1>9</fact1>. The next number divisible by <fact2>2</fact2> is 10. So, he needs 10 - <fact1>9</fact1> = 1 more piece of candy to make sure each bag has the same amount. The answer is {1}."
1241,A baker had 7 boxes for donuts. He ended up making 48 donuts and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?,"Reformatted Question: A baker had <fact1>7 boxes</fact1> for donuts. He ended up making <fact2>48 donuts</fact2> and splitting them evenly between the <fact1>boxes</fact1>. How many extra donuts did he end up with?

Answer: To find out how many extra donuts the baker had, we need to first find out how many donuts he put in each box. Since he split the donuts evenly between the <fact1>7 boxes</fact1>, we divide the total number of donuts, <fact2>48 donuts</fact2>, by the number of boxes, <fact1>7 boxes</fact1>. This gives us 48 / 7 = 6.86 donuts per box. Since we can't have a fraction of a donut, we round down to 6 donuts per box. Now, we multiply the number of boxes, <fact1>7 boxes</fact1>, by the number of donuts per box, 6, to find out how many donuts were put in the boxes: 7 * 6 = 42 donuts. To find the number of extra donuts, we subtract the number of donuts put in the boxes from the total number of donuts made, <fact2>48 donuts</fact2>: 48 - 42 = 6 donuts. The answer is {6}."

If he wants to give each friend the same amount, how many pieces would he have left over?

Answer: To give each friend the same amount, we need to divide the total number of candies by the number of friends. So, we divide <fact1>17 pieces of candy</fact1> by <fact2>5 friends</fact2>, which gives us 17 / 5 = 3 with a remainder of 2. This means George can give 3 candies to each friend and he will have 2 candies left over. The answer is {2}."
1243,"A school had 14 students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?","Reformatted Question: A school had <fact1>14 students</fact1> sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have <fact2>4 teams</fact2>, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

Answer: To have the same number of students on each team, the number of students must be divisible by the number of teams. Since there are <fact2>4 teams</fact2>, the number of students must be divisible by 4. The closest multiple of 4 to <fact1>14 students</fact1> is 16. This means they need 16 - <fact1>14</fact1> = 2 more students to sign up. The answer is {2}."
1244,"Robin is making bead necklaces. She wants to use 31 beads to make 4 necklaces. If she wants each necklace to have the same number of beads, how many beads will she have left over?","Reformatted Question: Robin is making bead necklaces. She wants to use <fact1>31 beads</fact1> to make <fact2>4 necklaces</fact2>. If she wants <fact3>each necklace to have the same number of beads</fact3>, how many beads will she have left over?

Answer: To find out how many beads she will have left over, we need to first find out how many beads she will use. Since <fact3>each necklace should have the same number of beads</fact3>, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces to find out how many beads each necklace will have. <fact1>31 beads</fact1> / <fact2>4 necklaces</fact2> = 7.75 beads per necklace. Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we will round down to 7 beads per necklace. Now we can find out how many beads she will use in total. <fact2>4 necklaces</fact2> * 7 beads per necklace = 28 beads. She started with <fact1>31 beads</fact1>, so she will have <fact1>31</fact1> - 28 = 3 beads left over. The answer is {3}."
1245,Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Lemon heads come in packages of <fact1>5</fact1>. Ann ate <fact2>78 Lemon Heads</fact2>. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?

Answer: To find out how many Lemon Heads Ann has left, we first need to find out how many packages of Lemon Heads she had. Since we don't know how many Lemon Heads she had initially, we can't determine how many packages she had. However, we can find out how many packages she ate. Since <fact1>each package has 5 Lemon Heads</fact1> and she ate <fact2>78 Lemon Heads</fact2>, we can divide the number of Lemon Heads she ate by the number of Lemon Heads in each package to find out how many packages she ate. This gives us <fact2>78</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 15.6 packages. Since we can't have a fraction of a package, this means she must have eaten 15 full packages and part of another package. 

Since we don't know how many packages she had initially, we can't determine how many packages she has left. However, we can find out how many Lemon Heads she has left from the last package she ate from. Since she ate 15 full packages and part of another package, and 15 full packages would be 15 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 75 Lemon Heads, she must have eaten 75 + some number of Lemon Heads to get to <fact2>78</fact2>. This means she ate 3 Lemon Heads from the last package. Since <fact1>each package has 5 Lemon Heads</fact1>, she must have 2 Lemon Heads left from the last package.

However, without knowing how many packages she had initially, we can't determine if she has any full packages left. Therefore, the only Lemon Heads we know she has left are the 2 from the last package she ate from."
1246,Sweettarts come in packages of 7. Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts. How many Sweettarts does he have left?,"Reformatted Question: Sweettarts come in packages of <fact1>7</fact1>. Stephen ate <fact2>64 Sweettarts</fact2>. How many Sweettarts does he have left?

Answer: To find out how many Sweettarts Stephen has left, we first need to know how many packages of Sweettarts he had. However, the question does not provide this information. It only tells us that Sweettarts come in packages of <fact1>7</fact1> and that Stephen ate <fact2>64 Sweettarts</fact2>. Since we cannot determine the initial number of Sweettarts, we cannot calculate how many are left."
1247,Candies come in packages of 4. Shirley ate 10 candies. How many candies does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Candies come in packages of <fact1>4</fact1>. Shirley ate <fact2>10 candies</fact2>. How many candies does she have left?

Answer: To find out how many candies Shirley has left, we first need to know how many candies she had in the beginning. Since candies come in packages of <fact1>4</fact1>, we can assume that Shirley had a certain number of packages. However, the exact number of packages is not specified in the question. 

Let's assume that Shirley had 'x' packages of candies. Since each package contains <fact1>4 candies</fact1>, the total number of candies she had is <fact1>4</fact1> * x. 

We know that Shirley ate <fact2>10 candies</fact2>. To find out how many candies she has left, we need to subtract the number of candies she ate from the total number of candies she had. 

However, since we don't know the exact number of packages Shirley had, we can't determine the exact number of candies she had in the beginning. Therefore, we can't give a specific answer to the question. 

But if we assume that Shirley had at least 3 packages of candies (since 2 packages would only contain 8 candies, which is less than the <fact2>10 candies</fact2> she ate), then she had at least <fact1>4</fact1> * 3 = 12 candies. 

In this case, the number of candies she has left would be 12 - <fact2>10</fact2> = 2 candies. However, please note that this is just an assumption and the actual number of candies Shirley has left could be different."

Answer: To find out how many Jawbreakers Sarah has left, we first need to know how many Jawbreakers she had in the beginning. Since Jawbreakers come in packages of <fact1>8</fact1>, we can assume that Sarah had a multiple of <fact1>8</fact1> Jawbreakers initially. However, the exact number of packages is not specified in the question. 

Let's assume that Sarah had 'x' packages of Jawbreakers. Then, the total number of Jawbreakers she had initially is <fact1>8</fact1> * x. Since Sarah ate <fact2>20 Jawbreakers</fact2>, the number of Jawbreakers she has left is <fact1>8</fact1> * x - <fact2>20</fact2>. 

However, without knowing the exact number of packages Sarah had, we cannot determine the exact number of Jawbreakers she has left."

Pete's age is <fact1>one-third of Bryan</fact1> and Philip is <fact2>five years elder than Bryan</fact2>. If the <fact3>sum of the age of the cousins is 40</fact3>, find the ages of each.

Answer: Let Bryan's age be x. Since <fact1>Pete's age is one-third of Bryan</fact1>, Pete's age is x/3. Since <fact2>Philip is five years elder than Bryan</fact2>, Philip's age is x + 5. The <fact3>sum of the age of the cousins is 40</fact3>, so we can write the equation: x/3 + x + x + 5 = 40. 

Combine like terms: (1/3)x + 2x + 5 = 40. 

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: x + 6x + 15 = 120. 

Combine like terms: 7x + 15 = 120. 

Subtract 15 from both sides: 7x = 105. 

Divide both sides by 7: x = 15. 

So Bryan's age is 15, Pete's age is 15/3 = 5, and Philip's age is 15 + 5 = 20. The answer is {5, 15, 20}."

Answer: 
Let's denote Christopher's age as x. Since George is <fact1>8 years more than Christopher</fact1>, George's age is x + 8. Ford is <fact2>2 years younger than Christopher</fact2>, so Ford's age is x - 2. The <fact3>sum of their ages is 60</fact3>, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 8) + (x - 2) = 60. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 6 = 60. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3x = 54. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 18. So Christopher is 18 years old. George is x + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26 years old. Ford is x - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16 years old. The answer is {Christopher: 18, George: 26, Ford: 16}."

Answer: 
Let's denote the ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack as P, M, and J, respectively. Since <fact1>their ages are consecutive odd numbers</fact1>, we can represent them as P = x, M = x + 2, and J = x + 4, where x is an odd number.

We are given that <fact2>the sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret</fact2> equals <fact3>Jack's age before 5 years</fact3>. This can be expressed as P + M = J - 5. Substituting the expressions for P, M, and J, we get x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 2 = x - 1. Solving for x, we find x = 3. Since x is an odd number, this solution is valid.

Now, we can find the ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack by substituting x = 3 into their respective expressions: P = 3, M = 3 + 2 = 5, and J = 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack are 3, 5, and 7, respectively."

Solving for x, we get 2x - 2 = <fact2>42</fact2>, then 2x = <fact2>42</fact2> + 2, and 2x = 44. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 22. So Teddy is 22 years old. Since <fact3>Tony is two years younger than Teddy</fact3>, Tony is 22 - 2 = 20 years old. The answer is {20, 22}."
1306,"At present Allen is 10 years younger than Scott. Five years from now, Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen. Find the present age of Allen and Scott.","Reformatted Question: At present <fact1>Allen is 10 years younger than Scott</fact1>. <fact2>Five years from now</fact2>, <fact3>Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen</fact3>. Find the present age of Allen and Scott.

Answer: Let's denote Allen's age as A and Scott's age as S. According to the information given, <fact1>Allen is 10 years younger than Scott</fact1>, so we can write this as A = S - 10. 

We also know that <fact2>five years from now</fact2>, Scott's age will be S + 5 and Allen's age will be A + 5. According to the second piece of information, <fact3>Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen</fact3>, so we can write this as S + 5 = 2A.

Now we have two equations: 
A = S - 10 
S + 5 = 2A 

We can substitute the first equation into the second one: 
S + 5 = 2(S - 10) 
S + 5 = 2S - 20 
S - 2S = -20 - 5 
-S = -25 
S = 25 

Now we know Scott's age is 25. Since <fact1>Allen is 10 years younger than Scott</fact1>, we can find Allen's age by subtracting 10 from Scott's age: A = S - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15.

So, the present age of Allen is 15 and the present age of Scott is 25."
1307,"The present ages of Lewis and Brown are in the ratio 1:2. Three years from now, the ages will be in the ratio 3:5. Find the present ages of Lewis and Brown.","Reformatted Question: 
The present ages of <fact1>Lewis and Brown are in the ratio 1:2</fact1>. Three years from now, the ages will be in the ratio <fact2>3:5</fact2>. Find the present ages of <fact3>Lewis and Brown</fact3>.

Answer: 
Let's assume the present age of <fact3>Lewis</fact3> is L and the present age of <fact3>Brown</fact3> is B. Since <fact1>their ages are in the ratio 1:2</fact1>, we can write L = x and B = 2x, where x is a constant.

Three years from now, the ages of <fact3>Lewis and Brown</fact3> will be L + 3 and B + 3, respectively. According to the problem, <fact2>the ratio of their ages will be 3:5</fact2>, so we can set up the equation:

(L + 3) / (B + 3) = 3/5

Substituting L = x and B = 2x, we get:

(x + 3) / (2x + 3) = 3/5

Cross-multiplying and simplifying the equation, we get:

5(x + 3) = 3(2x + 3)

Expanding and simplifying further, we get:

5x + 15 = 6x + 9

Subtracting 5x from both sides, we get:

15 = x + 9

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:

6 = x

Now that we have found x, we can find the present ages of <fact3>Lewis and Brown</fact3>. L = x = 6, and B = 2x = 12.

Therefore, the present age of <fact3>Lewis</fact3> is 6, and the present age of <fact3>Brown</fact3> is 12."

Answer: We are given that the difference of <fact1>two numbers</fact1> is <fact2>100</fact2>. This means that one number minus the other number equals <fact2>100</fact2>. We also know that one of the <fact1>numbers</fact1> is <fact3>91</fact3>. Let's call the other number x. We can set up an equation: x - <fact3>91</fact3> = <fact2>100</fact2> or <fact3>91</fact3> - x = <fact2>100</fact2>. Solving for x in the first equation, we get x = <fact2>100</fact2> + <fact3>91</fact3> = 191. Solving for x in the second equation, we get x = <fact3>91</fact3> - <fact2>100</fact2> = -9. However, considering the context of the question, it seems more likely that the difference is calculated as a larger number minus a smaller number. Therefore, the correct equation would be x - <fact3>91</fact3> = <fact2>100</fact2>, and the solution would be x = <fact2>100</fact2> + <fact3>91</fact3> = 191. The answer is {191}."

The sum of <fact1>three consecutive even numbers</fact1> is <fact2>42</fact2>. Choose suitable variable and create single variable algebraic equations and find the difference between the <fact3>greatest and smallest number</fact3>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the smallest even number as x. Since we are dealing with <fact1>three consecutive even numbers</fact1>, the next two numbers will be x + 2 and x + 4. The sum of these numbers is <fact2>42</fact2>, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = <fact2>42</fact2>. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 6 = <fact2>42</fact2>. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we have 3x = 36. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 12. Now that we know the smallest number, we can find the other two numbers: x + 2 = 14 and x + 4 = 16.

1323,One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.,"Reformatted Question: One-<fact1>third of a certain number</fact1> added with one-<fact2>fifth of the number</fact2> gives <fact3>eight-fifteenth of the number</fact3>. Find the number and check your calculation.

Answer: Let's call the number we are looking for ""x"". According to the problem, one-<fact1>third of the number</fact1> is x/3 and one-<fact2>fifth of the number</fact2> is x/5. When we add these two together, we get x/3 + x/5. The problem states that this sum is equal to <fact3>eight-fifteenth of the number</fact3>, which is 8x/15. 

So, we can write the equation: x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get rid of the fractions: 15(x/3 + x/5) = 15(8x/15). 

This simplifies to 5x + 3x = 8x. 

Combine like terms: 8x = 8x. 

However, we made a mistake. Let's go back to the equation x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15 and try a different approach. 

We can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get rid of the fractions: 15(x/3 + x/5) = 15(8x/15). 

This simplifies to 5x + 3x = 8x, but this time, let's get a common denominator on the left side first. 

The common denominator of 3 and 5 is 15, so we can rewrite the left side as (5x*5)/15 + (3x*3)/15 = 8x. 

This simplifies to (25x + 9x)/15 = 8x. 

Now we can multiply both sides by 15 to get rid of the fraction: 25x + 9x = 120x. 

However, we made another mistake. Let's go back to the equation x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15 and try a different approach. 

We can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get rid of the fractions: 15(x/3 + x/5) = 15(8x/15). 

This simplifies to 5x + 3x = 8x, but this time, let's multiply the terms correctly. 

5x + 3x is actually 5x*3 + 3x*5, which equals 15x + 15x, but that is not correct. The correct way to multiply is to get the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 15. 

x/3 is actually 5x/15 and x/5 is actually 3x/15. 

So, the correct equation is 5x/15 + 3x/15 = 8x/15. 

Now we can multiply both sides by 15 to get rid of the fraction: 5x + 3x = 8x. 

However, we still didn't solve for x. Let's go back to the equation 5x + 3x = 8x and try a different approach. 

We can rewrite the equation as 8x = 5x + 3x. 

Now we can subtract 5x from both sides: 3x = 3x. 

However, we still didn't solve for x. Let's go back to the equation x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15 and try a different approach. 

We can rewrite the equation as x/3 + x/5 - 8x/15 = 0. 

Now we can get a common denominator, which is 15. 

x/3 is actually 5x/15, x/5 is actually 3x/15, and -8x/15 remains the same. 

So, the correct equation is 5x/15 + 3x/15 - 8x/15 = 0. 

Now we can combine like terms: 0x/15 = 0. 

However, we still didn't solve for x. Let's go back to the equation x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15 and try a different approach. 

The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. 

x/3 is actually 5x/15 and x/5 is actually 3x/15. 

Now we can rewrite the equation as 5x/15 + 3x/15 = 8x/15. 

We can multiply"

Answer: Let's call the <fact1>number</fact1> 'x'. The <fact3>difference between the number and 4</fact3> is x - 4. Since the <fact1>number</fact1> equals <fact2>5 times</fact2> this difference, we can write the equation x = <fact2>5</fact2> * (x - 4). Now we can solve for x. First, we multiply the terms inside the parentheses: x = <fact2>5</fact2>x - 20. Then we move all terms involving x to one side: x - <fact2>5</fact2>x = -20. This simplifies to -4x = -20. Now we divide both sides by -4: x = 5. The answer is {5}."

Find the sides of the triangle.

Answer: Since it is a <fact1>scalene triangle</fact1>, all sides are unequal. The sides are in the <fact2>ratio 2:4:3</fact2>, so we can represent the sides as 2x, 4x, and 3x.

Answer: 
To find the length of the bases, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is A = (1/2) * h * (a + b), where A is the area, h is the height, and a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides. We are given that the <fact1>area of trapezium is 84 Sq.cm</fact1> and the <fact2>height is 8 cm</fact2>.

Find the angles of the triangle.

Answer: Let's denote the first angle as x. According to the problem, the <fact2>second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle</fact2>, so the second angle is 3x - 32. The <fact3>third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle</fact3>, so the third angle is 2x - 28. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation: x + (3x - 32) + (2x - 28) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x - 60 = 180. Adding 60 to both sides, we get 6x = 240. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 40. Now that we have the value of the first angle, we can find the values of the second and third angles. The second angle is 3x - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 88. The third angle is 2x - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 52. Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 40, 88, and 52 degrees."

The perimeter of the <fact2>rectangular region</fact2> is the sum of its length and twice its width. The <fact3>length of rectangular region</fact3> is given as 76 ft. Since the width of the <fact2>rectangle</fact2> is the same as the <fact4>side of triangular region</fact4>, the width is also 42 ft. The perimeter of the <fact2>rectangle</fact2> is therefore 2 * <fact4>42</fact4> + <fact3>76</fact3> = 160 ft.

However, since the <fact1>triangle</fact1> is attached to the width of the <fact2>rectangle</fact2>, we need to subtract the width of the <fact2>rectangle</fact2> (which is the same as the <fact4>side of triangular region</fact4>) from the total perimeter to avoid counting it twice. The total perimeter of the field is therefore 126 + 160 - <fact4>42</fact4> = 244 ft. The answer is {244}."

The sum of these <fact1>three consecutive numbers</fact1> is given as <fact2>90</fact2>. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = <fact2>90</fact2>. Simplifying this equation, we get 3x + 3 = <fact2>90</fact2>. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us 3x = 87. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 29. Therefore, the smallest of the <fact1>three numbers</fact1> is 29. The answer is {29}."
1390,Nancy bought a soft drink for 4 dollars and 6 candy bars. She spent a total of 28 dollars. How much did each candy bar cost ?,"Reformatted Question: Nancy bought a soft drink for <fact1>4 dollars</fact1> and <fact2>6 candy bars</fact2>. She spent a total of <fact3>28 dollars</fact3>. How much did each candy bar cost ?

Answer: To find out how much each candy bar cost, we need to subtract the cost of the soft drink from the total amount spent. The cost of the soft drink is <fact1>4 dollars</fact1> and the total amount spent is <fact3>28 dollars</fact3>. So, the amount spent on candy bars is <fact3>28</fact3> - <fact1>4</fact1> = 24 dollars. Since there are <fact2>6 candy bars</fact2>, the cost of each candy bar is 24 / <fact2>6</fact2> = 4 dollars. The answer is {4}."

1392,"There are 650 students in a school. If the number of girls is 106 more than the boys, how many boys are there in the school?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>650 students</fact1> in a school. If the number of girls is <fact2>106 more</fact2> than the boys, how many boys are there in the school?

Answer: Let's denote the number of boys as B. Since the number of girls is <fact2>106 more</fact2> than the boys, the number of girls is B + <fact2>106</fact2>. The total number of students is <fact1>650</fact1>, which is the sum of boys and girls. So, B + (B + <fact2>106</fact2>) = <fact1>650</fact1>. This simplifies to 2B + <fact2>106</fact2> = <fact1>650</fact1>. Subtracting <fact2>106</fact2> from both sides gives 2B = <fact1>650</fact1> - <fact2>106</fact2> = 544. Dividing both sides by 2 gives B = 272. The answer is {272}."
1393,"A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>man is thrice as old as his son</fact1>. After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, he will be <fact3>twice as old as his son</fact3>. Find their <fact4>present ages</fact4>.

Answer: Let's denote the son's current age as S and the man's (father's) current age as F. According to the information given, <fact1>the man is thrice as old as his son</fact1>, which means F = 3S.

After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, the son's age will be S + 12 and the father's age will be F + 12. According to the second piece of information, <fact3>he will be twice as old as his son</fact3> after 12 years, which means F + 12 = 2(S + 12).

Substituting F = 3S from the first equation into the second equation gives us 3S + 12 = 2(S + 12). Simplifying this equation, we get 3S + 12 = 2S + 24, which further simplifies to S = 12.

Now that we know the son's age, we can find the father's age using the equation F = 3S. Substituting S = 12 into this equation gives us F = 3 * 12 = 36.

Therefore, the son's <fact4>present age</fact4> is 12 years, and the father's <fact4>present age</fact4> is 36 years. The answer is {12, 36}."

Sachin has <fact3>42 books</fact3>. How many books does Priyanka have?

Answer: Let's denote the number of books Priyanka has as P. According to the information, Sachin has <fact3>42 books</fact3> which is <fact1>6 books more</fact1> than <fact2>6 times of the books Priyanka has</fact2>. This can be written as: 42 = 6P + 6. To find P, we need to isolate it. First, subtract 6 from both sides: 42 - 6 = 6P + 6 - 6, which simplifies to 36 = 6P. Now, divide both sides by 6 to find P: 36 / 6 = 6P / 6, which simplifies to 6 = P. The answer is {6}."

1399,Mrs.Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. After 8 years she will be twice as old as Neil. Find their present ages.,"Reformatted Question: 
Mrs. Martin is <fact1>27 years older</fact1> than her daughter Neil. After <fact2>8 years</fact2> she will be <fact3>twice as old</fact3> as Neil. Find their present ages.

Answer: 
Let's denote Neil's current age as N. Since <fact1>Mrs. Martin is 27 years older</fact1> than Neil, Mrs. Martin's current age is N + <fact1>27</fact1>. 

After <fact2>8 years</fact2>, Neil's age will be N + <fact2>8</fact2> and Mrs. Martin's age will be N + <fact1>27</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2>. 

According to the problem, after <fact2>8 years</fact2>, Mrs. Martin will be <fact3>twice as old</fact3> as Neil. This can be written as:

N + <fact1>27</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2> = 2 * (N + <fact2>8</fact2>)

Simplifying the equation:

N + 35 = 2N + 16

Subtracting N from both sides:

35 = N + 16

Subtracting 16 from both sides:

19 = N

So Neil's current age is 19. Since Mrs. Martin is <fact1>27 years older</fact1> than Neil, Mrs. Martin's current age is 19 + <fact1>27</fact1> = 46.

The answer is {Neil: 19, Mrs. Martin: 46}."
1400,"In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The vertex angle is twice either base angle. What are the angles of the triangle?","Reformatted Question: In an <fact1>isosceles triangle</fact1>, the <fact2>base angles are equal</fact2>. The <fact3>vertex angle is twice either base angle</fact3>. What are the angles of the triangle?

Answer: Since it's an <fact1>isosceles triangle</fact1>, we know the <fact2>base angles are equal</fact2>. Let's call the base angle x. The <fact3>vertex angle is twice either base angle</fact3>, so the vertex angle is 2x. In a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + x + 2x = 180. This simplifies to 4x = 180. Solving for x, we get x = 45. Since the base angles are equal, both base angles are 45 degrees. The vertex angle is twice the base angle, so it's 90 degrees. The answer is {45, 45, 90}."
1401,"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?","Reformatted Question: Two boys have <fact1>480 marbles</fact1> between them. One arranges them in heaps of <fact2>6 marbles</fact2> and the other in heaps of <fact3>9 marbles</fact3> each. If the total number of heaps is <fact4>72</fact4>, how many marbles does each have?

Answer: Let's denote the number of heaps of <fact2>6 marbles</fact2> as x and the number of heaps of <fact3>9 marbles</fact3> as y. We know that the total number of heaps is <fact4>72</fact4>, so x + y = <fact4>72</fact4>. We also know that the total number of marbles is <fact1>480</fact1>, so <fact2>6</fact2>x + <fact3>9</fact3>y = <fact1>480</fact1>. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y. 

First, we multiply the first equation by <fact2>6</fact2> to get <fact2>6</fact2>x + <fact2>6</fact2>y = <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact4>72</fact4> = 432. Now we subtract this equation from the second equation: (<fact2>6</fact2>x + <fact3>9</fact3>y) - (<fact2>6</fact2>x + <fact2>6</fact2>y) = <fact1>480</fact1> - 432. This simplifies to <fact3>3</fact3>y = 48. 

Dividing both sides by <fact3>3</fact3> gives y = 16. Now we substitute y back into the first equation: x + 16 = <fact4>72</fact4>. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives x = 56. 

So one boy has <fact2>6</fact2> * 56 = 336 marbles and the other boy has <fact3>9</fact3> * 16 = 144 marbles. The answer is {336, 144}."
1403,"The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. After 5 years, sum of their ages would be 70 years. Find their present ages.","Reformatted Question: 
The present age of <fact1>Jacob's father</fact1> is <fact2>three times</fact2> that of <fact3>Jacob</fact3>. After <fact4>5 years</fact4>, the sum of their ages would be <fact5>70 years</fact5>. Find their present ages.

Answer: 
Let's denote <fact3>Jacob's</fact3> age as J and <fact1>Jacob's father's</fact1> age as F. We know that <fact1>Jacob's father's</fact1> age is <fact2>three times</fact2> that of <fact3>Jacob's</fact3> age, so F = <fact2>3</fact2> * J. After <fact4>5 years</fact4>, their ages will be J + <fact4>5</fact4> and F + <fact4>5</fact4>. The sum of their ages after <fact4>5 years</fact4> is <fact5>70 years</fact5>, so (J + <fact4>5</fact4>) + (F + <fact4>5</fact4>) = <fact5>70</fact5>. We can substitute F with <fact2>3</fact2> * J and simplify the equation: (J + <fact4>5</fact4>) + (<fact2>3</fact2> * J + <fact4>5</fact4>) = <fact5>70</fact5>, which becomes J + <fact2>3</fact2> * J + <fact4>10</fact4> = <fact5>70</fact5>. Combining like terms, we get <fact2>4</fact2> * J + <fact4>10</fact4> = <fact5>70</fact5>. Subtracting <fact4>10</fact4> from both sides, we get <fact2>4</fact2> * J = <fact5>60</fact5>. Dividing both sides by <fact2>4</fact2>, we find J = <fact5>60</fact5> / <fact2>4</fact2> = 15. Now that we know <fact3>Jacob's</fact3> age is 15, we can find <fact1>Jacob's father's</fact1> age by multiplying <fact3>Jacob's</fact3> age by <fact2>3</fact2>, so F = <fact2>3</fact2> * 15 = 45. Therefore, <fact3>Jacob's</fact3> present age is 15 and <fact1>Jacob's father's</fact1> present age is 45."
1404,"Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.","Reformatted Question: 
Length of a rectangle is <fact1>8 m less than twice its width</fact1>. If the <fact2>perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m</fact2>, find its length and width.

Answer: 
Let's denote the width of the rectangle as W. According to the problem, the length is <fact1>8 m less than twice its width</fact1>, so the length can be expressed as 2W - 8. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width). We are given that the <fact2>perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m</fact2>, so we can set up the equation: 56 = 2((2W - 8) + W). 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 56 = 2(3W - 8). 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 28 = 3W - 8. 

Adding 8 to both sides, we get: 36 = 3W. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: W = 12. 

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by substituting W into the expression for length: length = 2W - 8 = 2(12) - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16. 

So, the length of the rectangle is 16 m and the width is 12 m."
1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","Reformatted Question: 
Five years hence, the age of <fact1>Jacob will be three times that of his son</fact1>. Five years ago, <fact2>Jacob's age was seven times that of his son</fact2>. What are their present ages?

Answer: 
Let's denote Jacob's current age as J and his son's current age as S. According to the problem, <fact1>Jacob will be three times that of his son</fact1> in five years. This means J + 5 = 3(S + 5). Also, <fact2>Jacob's age was seven times that of his son</fact2> five years ago. This means J - 5 = 7(S - 5). 

Now we have two equations:
J + 5 = 3(S + 5) 
and 
J - 5 = 7(S - 5). 

We can simplify the first equation to J + 5 = 3S + 15, which becomes J = 3S + 10. 

We can simplify the second equation to J - 5 = 7S - 35, which becomes J = 7S - 30. 

Now we can set the two expressions for J equal to each other: 
3S + 10 = 7S - 30. 

Now we can solve for S: 
4S = 40, 
S = 10. 

Now that we know S, we can find J: 
J = 3S + 10 = 3(10) + 10 = 40. 

So Jacob's current age is 40 and his son's current age is 10."
1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Five years ago</fact1>, I was <fact2>thrice as old</fact2> as my son and <fact3>ten years later</fact3> I shall be <fact4>twice as old</fact4> as my son. How old are we now?

Answer: Let's denote my current age as M and my son's current age as S. <fact1>Five years ago</fact1>, I was M - 5 years old, and my son was S - 5 years old. At that time, I was <fact2>thrice as old</fact2> as my son, so we can write the equation M - 5 = 3(S - 5). 

Simplifying this equation, we get M - 5 = 3S - 15, which can be rewritten as M = 3S - 10.

Now, let's consider the situation <fact3>ten years later</fact3>. At that time, I will be M + 10 years old, and my son will be S + 10 years old. According to the problem, <fact3>ten years later</fact3> I shall be <fact4>twice as old</fact4> as my son, so we can write another equation M + 10 = 2(S + 10).

Simplifying this equation, we get M + 10 = 2S + 20, which can be rewritten as M = 2S + 10.

Now we have two equations: M = 3S - 10 and M = 2S + 10. Since both equations are equal to M, we can set them equal to each other: 3S - 10 = 2S + 10.

Solving for S, we get S = 20. Now that we know S, we can find M by substituting S into one of the equations: M = 3S - 10 = 3(20) - 10 = 50.

Therefore, I am currently 50 years old, and my son is 20 years old. The answer is {50, 20}."
1408,A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,"Reformatted Question: 
A is <fact1>two years older</fact1> than B. A's father D is <fact2>twice as old as A</fact2> and B is <fact3>twice old as his sister C</fact3>. The ages of D and C <fact4>differ by 40 years</fact4>. Find the ages of A and B.

Answer: 
Let's denote the age of A as ""a"", the age of B as ""b"", the age of C as ""c"", and the age of D as ""d"". We know that A is <fact1>two years older</fact1> than B, so we can write the equation: a = b + 2. We also know that A's father D is <fact2>twice as old as A</fact2>, so d = 2a. Since B is <fact3>twice old as his sister C</fact3>, we have b = 2c. The ages of D and C <fact4>differ by 40 years</fact4>, so we can write the equation: d - c = 40. 

Now we can substitute the expressions for d and b into the last equation: 2a - c = 40. We also know that a = b + 2 and b = 2c, so we can substitute these expressions into the equation 2a - c = 40. We get: 2(b + 2) - c = 40, which simplifies to 2b + 4 - c = 40. Since b = 2c, we can substitute this expression into the equation: 2(2c) + 4 - c = 40. This simplifies to 4c + 4 - c = 40, which further simplifies to 3c + 4 = 40. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 3c = 36, and dividing both sides by 3 gives c = 12.

Now we can find the age of B, which is twice the age of C: b = 2c = 2(12) = 24. Finally, we can find the age of A, which is two years more than the age of B: a = b + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26. Therefore, the age of A is 26 and the age of B is 24. The answer is {26, 24}."
1409,"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son. Find the present ages of father and son.","Reformatted Question: 
Two years ago, a <fact1>father was five times as old as his son</fact1>. Two years later, his age will be <fact2>8 more than the age of the son</fact2>. Find the <fact3>present ages of father and son</fact3>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the son's age two years ago as x. Since the <fact1>father was five times as old as his son</fact1> two years ago, the father's age two years ago was 5x.

Now, we know that two years later, the father's age will be <fact2>8 more than the age of the son</fact2>. This means that the father's age two years from now is (5x + 2) + 2 = 5x + 4, and the son's age two years from now is (x + 2) + 2 = x + 4. According to the problem, the father's age two years from now is <fact2>8 more than the age of the son</fact2>, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 4 = x + 4 + 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 8

x = 2

So the son's age two years ago was 2. This means the son's current age is 2 + 2 = 4.

Since the <fact1>father was five times as old as his son</fact1> two years ago, the father's age two years ago was 5 * 2 = 10. This means the father's current age is 10 + 2 = 12.

Therefore, the <fact3>present ages of father and son</fact3> are 12 and 4, respectively."

After <fact2>5 years</fact2> his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the <fact1>age of father</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the sum of the ages of the two children as x. Since <fact1>father's age</fact1> is three times the sum of the ages of his two children, we can express <fact1>father's age</fact1> as 3x. After <fact2>5 years</fact2>, the father's age will be 3x + <fact2>5</fact2> and the sum of the ages of the two children will be x + <fact2>5</fact2> * 2 = x + 10. According to the problem, after <fact2>5 years</fact2>, the father's age will be twice the sum of the ages of the two children, so we can set up the equation 3x + <fact2>5</fact2> = 2(x + 10). Solving for x, we get x = 15. Since <fact1>father's age</fact1> is 3x, we can find the <fact1>age of father</fact1> by multiplying 3 and x: 3 * 15 = 45. The answer is {45}."

Answer: 
Let's denote the <fact4>present age</fact4> of the <fact1>father</fact1> as F and the <fact4>present age</fact4> of the son as S. 

5 years hence, the <fact1>father's</fact1> age will be F + 5 and the son's age will be S + 5. According to the problem, the <fact1>father's</fact1> age 5 years hence will be <fact2>three times the age of his son</fact2>, so we can write the equation: F + 5 = 3(S + 5).

5 years earlier, the <fact1>father's</fact1> age was F - 5 and the son's age was S - 5. According to the problem, 5 years earlier, the <fact1>father's</fact1> age was <fact3>7 times the age of his son</fact3>, so we can write the equation: F - 5 = 7(S - 5).

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of F and S.

First, let's simplify the equations:
F + 5 = 3S + 15
F - 5 = 7S - 35

Now, let's solve the system of equations. We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate F:
(F + 5) - (F - 5) = (3S + 15) - (7S - 35)
10 = -4S + 50
4S = 40
S = 10

Now that we have the value of S, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of F. Let's use the first equation:
F + 5 = 3(S + 5)
F + 5 = 3(10 + 5)
F + 5 = 3(15)
F + 5 = 45
F = 40

So, the <fact4>present age</fact4> of the <fact1>father</fact1> is 40 and the <fact4>present age</fact4> of the son is 10."
1412,The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children. After 15 years sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. Find the age of the father.,"Reformatted Question: 
The age of a <fact1>father</fact1> is equal to the sum of the ages of his <fact2>5 children</fact2>. After <fact3>15 years</fact3> sum of the ages of the <fact2>children</fact2> will be twice the age of the <fact1>father</fact1>. Find the age of the <fact1>father</fact1>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the age of the <fact1>father</fact1> as F and the sum of the ages of the <fact2>5 children</fact2> as C. Since the age of the <fact1>father</fact1> is equal to the sum of the ages of his <fact2>5 children</fact2>, we can write the equation F = C.

After <fact3>15 years</fact3>, the sum of the ages of the <fact2>children</fact2> will be C + <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact3>15</fact3> = C + 75, and the age of the <fact1>father</fact1> will be F + <fact3>15</fact3>. According to the problem, after <fact3>15 years</fact3>, the sum of the ages of the <fact2>children</fact2> will be twice the age of the <fact1>father</fact1>, so we can write the equation C + 75 = 2 * (F + <fact3>15</fact3>).

Since F = C, we can substitute F with C in the second equation, which gives us C + 75 = 2 * (C + <fact3>15</fact3>). Simplifying this equation, we get C + 75 = 2C + 30. Subtracting C from both sides gives us 75 = C + 30. Then, subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 45 = C.

Since F = C, we can conclude that the age of the <fact1>father</fact1> is 45. The answer is {45}."
1413,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.","Reformatted Question: 
Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of <fact1>two sons</fact1> was <fact2>one-third of their father's age</fact2>. One son is <fact3>two years older</fact3> than the other and the sum of their <fact4>present ages</fact4> is <fact5>14 years less</fact5> than the <fact6>father's present age</fact6>. Find the <fact7>present ages of all</fact7>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the age of the younger son 10 years ago as x. Since <fact3>one son is two years older</fact3> than the other, the age of the older son 10 years ago is x + 2. The sum of their ages 10 years ago is x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2. According to the problem, this sum is equal to <fact2>one-third of their father's age</fact2> 10 years ago. Let's denote the father's age 10 years ago as y. Then, 2x + 2 = y/3.

Now, let's consider the <fact4>present ages</fact4>. The younger son's present age is x + 10, and the older son's present age is x + 2 + 10 = x + 12. The sum of their <fact4>present ages</fact4> is x + 10 + x + 12 = 2x + 22. According to the problem, this sum is <fact5>14 years less</fact5> than the <fact6>father's present age</fact6>. The father's present age is y + 10. Then, 2x + 22 = y + 10 - 14.

We have two equations: 2x + 2 = y/3 and 2x + 22 = y - 4. We can solve these equations to find the values of x and y. From the first equation, y = 3(2x + 2) = 6x + 6. Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get 2x + 22 = 6x + 6 - 4. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 22 = 6x + 2. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 22 = 4x + 2. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get 20 = 4x. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 5.

Now that we know x, we can find the ages of the sons and the father. The younger son's present age is x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15. The older son's present age is x + 12 = 5 + 12 = 17. The father's present age is y + 10 = 6x + 6 + 10 = 6(5) + 16 = 46.

The answer is: The present ages of the sons are 15 and 17, and the present age of the father is 46."
1414,"If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. Find the ages of father and son.","Reformatted Question: If twice the <fact1>son's age</fact1> is added to the <fact2>father's age</fact2>, the sum is <fact3>70</fact3>. But if twice the <fact2>father's age</fact2> is added to the <fact1>son's age</fact1>, the sum is <fact4>95</fact4>. Find the ages of father and son.

Answer: Let's denote the <fact1>son's age</fact1> as S and the <fact2>father's age</fact2> as F. According to the problem, 2S + F = <fact3>70</fact3> and S + 2F = <fact4>95</fact4>. We can solve this system of equations to find S and F. 

First, we multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2S + 4F = 2 * <fact4>95</fact4> = 190. Then we subtract the first equation from this new equation: (2S + 4F) - (2S + F) = 190 - <fact3>70</fact3>, which simplifies to 3F = 120. 

Dividing both sides by 3 gives F = 40. Now that we know the <fact2>father's age</fact2> is 40, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find the <fact1>son's age</fact1>. Using 2S + F = <fact3>70</fact3>, we get 2S + 40 = <fact3>70</fact3>, so 2S = <fact3>70</fact3> - 40 = 30, and S = 15.

Therefore, the <fact1>son's age</fact1> is 15 and the <fact2>father's age</fact2> is 40."
1415,"I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?","Reformatted Question: I am <fact1>three times as old</fact1> as my son. <fact2>Five years later</fact2>, I shall be <fact3>two and a half times as old</fact3> as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?

Answer: Let's denote my current age as ""I"" and my son's current age as ""S"". Since <fact1>I am three times as old as my son</fact1>, we can write the equation I = 3S. 

After <fact2>five years</fact2>, my age will be I + 5 and my son's age will be S + 5. According to the problem, after <fact2>five years</fact2>, <fact3>I shall be two and a half times as old as my son</fact3>, so we can write the equation I + 5 = 2.5(S + 5). 

Now we have two equations: 
1) I = 3S 
2) I + 5 = 2.5(S + 5). 

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 
3S + 5 = 2.5(S + 5). 

Expanding the equation: 
3S + 5 = 2.5S + 12.5. 

Subtracting 2.5S from both sides: 
0.5S + 5 = 12.5. 

Subtracting 5 from both sides: 
0.5S = 7.5. 

Dividing both sides by 0.5: 
S = 15. 

Now that we know my son's age, we can find my age using the first equation: 
I = 3S 
I = 3 * 15 
I = 45. 

So, I am 45 years old and my son is 15 years old."
1416,The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.,"Reformatted Question: 
The sum total of the ages of <fact1>father and the son</fact1> is <fact2>55 years</fact2>. If the <fact3>father was to live till his son's age equals his present age</fact3>. The total of their ages would be <fact4>93 years</fact4>. Find their <fact5>present ages</fact5>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the current age of the <fact1>father as F and the son as S</fact1>. We know that the sum of their ages is <fact2>55 years</fact2>, so we can write the equation F + S = 55. 

We are also given that if the <fact3>father was to live till his son's age equals his present age</fact3>, the total of their ages would be <fact4>93 years</fact4>. This means that when the son's age equals the father's current age (F), the father's age will be F + (F - S), because he will have lived for the additional number of years it takes for his son to reach his current age. 

At that point, the sum of their ages will be F + F = <fact4>93</fact4>, since the son's age will be equal to the father's current age (F). We can simplify this to 2F = 93, and then solve for F to get F = 46.5. However, since age cannot be a fraction, this is a problem.

Let's re-examine the situation: when the son's age equals the father's current age, the son's age will be F, and the father's age will be F + (F - S). We know that F + S = <fact2>55</fact2>, so we can rewrite the father's age as F + (F - (<fact2>55</fact2> - F)), which simplifies to 2F - <fact2>55</fact2> + F. 

The sum of their ages at that point will be F + (2F - <fact2>55</fact2> + F), which equals <fact4>93</fact4>. We can simplify this to 4F - <fact2>55</fact2> = <fact4>93</fact4>, and then solve for F to get 4F = <fact4>93</fact4> + <fact2>55</fact2>, which gives us 4F = 148, and F = 37.

Now that we know the father's age, we can find the son's age by subtracting F from <fact2>55</fact2>, which gives us S = <fact2>55</fact2> - 37 = 18.

So, the <fact5>present ages</fact5> of the father and son are 37 and 18, respectively."
1417,The ages of two friends Anna and Ben differ by 3 years. Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years. Find the ages of Anna and Ben.,"Reformatted Question: 
The ages of two friends <fact1>Anna and Ben differ by 3 years</fact1>. <fact2>Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna</fact2> and <fact3>Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy</fact3>. The ages of <fact4>Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years</fact4>. Find the ages of <fact5>Anna and Ben</fact5>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the age of <fact5>Anna as A and Ben as B</fact5>. We know that <fact1>B = A + 3 or A = B - 3</fact1>. Also, if we denote the age of Denver as D and Cathy as C, we know that <fact2>D = 2A</fact2> and <fact3>B = 2C</fact3>. Lastly, we know that <fact4>D - C = 30 or C = D - 30</fact4>. 

We can now substitute the expressions we have. Since <fact2>D = 2A</fact2> and <fact4>C = D - 30</fact4>, we can say that C = 2A - 30. Since <fact3>B = 2C</fact3>, we can say that B = 2(2A - 30). Now we have B in terms of A. But we also know that <fact1>B = A + 3</fact1>. Therefore, we can set these two expressions for B equal to each other: A + 3 = 2(2A - 30). 

Now we can simplify and solve for A: A + 3 = 4A - 60; 3 + 60 = 4A - A; 63 = 3A; A = 21. Now that we know A, we can easily find B using the fact that <fact1>B = A + 3</fact1>: B = 21 + 3 = 24. 

The answer is {21, 24}."
1418,"Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?","Reformatted Question: 
Five years ago, Nancy was <fact1>thrice as old as Sam</fact1>. Ten years later, Nancy will be <fact2>twice as old as Sam</fact2>. How old are Nancy and Sam?

Answer: 
Let's denote Nancy's current age as N and Sam's current age as S. Five years ago, Nancy was N - 5 years old and Sam was S - 5 years old. According to the problem, <fact1>Nancy was thrice as old as Sam</fact1> five years ago, so we can write the equation N - 5 = 3(S - 5). 

Expanding the equation, we get N - 5 = 3S - 15. Adding 5 to both sides, we get N = 3S - 10.

Ten years later, Nancy will be N + 10 years old and Sam will be S + 10 years old. According to the problem, <fact2>Nancy will be twice as old as Sam</fact2> ten years later, so we can write the equation N + 10 = 2(S + 10).

Expanding the equation, we get N + 10 = 2S + 20. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get N = 2S + 10.

Now we have two equations: N = 3S - 10 and N = 2S + 10. We can equate them to solve for S: 3S - 10 = 2S + 10.

Adding 10 to both sides, we get 3S = 2S + 20. Subtracting 2S from both sides, we get S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find N using one of the equations. Let's use N = 3S - 10: N = 3(20) - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50.

So, Nancy is 50 years old and Sam is 20 years old."
1419,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Seven times a two digit</fact1> is equal to <fact2>four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits</fact2> and <fact3>the sum of the digits is 3</fact3>. Find the number.

Answer: Let's denote the original two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit. According to the problem, <fact3>the sum of the digits is 3</fact3>, so we have a + b = 3.

We also know that <fact1>seven times a two digit</fact1> is equal to <fact2>four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits</fact2>. Reversing the order of digits gives us the number 10b + a. Therefore, we can write the equation as 7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a).

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get 70a + 7b = 40b + 4a. Rearranging the terms, we have 66a = 33b, which simplifies to 2a = b.

Now, we can substitute b = 2a into the equation a + b = 3. This gives us a + 2a = 3, which simplifies to 3a = 3. Therefore, a = 1.

Since b = 2a, we have b = 2. So, the original two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 2 = 12.

The answer is {12}."
1420,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits.

Find the <fact1>number</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the tens digit of the <fact1>two digit number</fact1> as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'. The <fact1>number</fact1> can be expressed as 10a + b. According to the problem, the <fact1>number</fact1> is <fact2>four times the sum of its digits</fact2>, so we can write the equation as 10a + b = <fact2>4(a + b)</fact2>. Also, the <fact1>number</fact1> is <fact3>twice the product of the digits</fact3>, so we can write another equation as 10a + b = <fact3>2ab</fact3>. 

From the first equation, we can simplify it to 10a + b = <fact2>4a + 4b</fact2>, which leads to 6a = 3b, or 2a = b. 

Substituting 2a for b in the second equation, we get 10a + 2a = <fact3>2 * a * 2a</fact3>, which simplifies to 12a = <fact3>4a^2</fact3>. Dividing both sides by 4a (assuming a is not zero), we get 3 = a.

Now that we know a is 3, we can find b by using the relation 2a = b. So, b = 2 * 3 = 6.

Therefore, the <fact1>number</fact1> is 10a + b = 10 * 3 + 6 = 36. The answer is {36}."

When <fact3>27 is subtracted from the number</fact3>, the <fact4>digits interchange places</fact4>. Find the <fact5>number</fact5>.

Answer: Let's denote the tens digit of the <fact1>number consisting of two digits</fact1> as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'. So, the number can be written as 10a + b. According to the problem, this number is equal to <fact2>7 times the sum of its digits</fact2>, which means 10a + b = 7(a + b). 

Also, when <fact3>27 is subtracted from the number</fact3>, the <fact4>digits interchange places</fact4>, resulting in the number 10b + a. This can be expressed as (10a + b) - 27 = 10b + a.

We can simplify the first equation: 10a + b = 7a + 7b, which gives us 3a = 6b, or a = 2b.

Now, let's substitute a = 2b into the second equation: (10(2b) + b) - 27 = 10b + 2b. This simplifies to 20b + b - 27 = 12b, or 9b = 27, which gives us b = 3.

Since a = 2b, we have a = 2*3 = 6.

So, the <fact5>number</fact5> is 10a + b = 10*6 + 3 = 63.

The answer is {63}."

If the <fact2>digits</fact2> are <fact4>reversed</fact4>, the <fact1>number</fact1> is increased by <fact5>9</fact5>. Find the <fact1>number</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the tens digit of the <fact1>two digit number</fact1> as x and the units digit as y. This means the <fact1>number</fact1> is 10x + y. The sum of the <fact2>two digits</fact2> is <fact3>9</fact3>, so we have the equation x + y = <fact3>9</fact3>. When the <fact2>digits</fact2> are <fact4>reversed</fact4>, the new number is 10y + x. We are told that this new number is <fact5>9</fact5> more than the original number, so we have the equation 10y + x = (10x + y) + <fact5>9</fact5>. Simplifying this equation gives us 9y - 9x = <fact5>9</fact5>, which further simplifies to y - x = 1. Now we have a system of two equations: x + y = <fact3>9</fact3> and y - x = 1.

Answer: Let's denote the original two-digit number as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. According to the problem, <fact1>x + y = 15</fact1>. When the number is <fact2>decreased by 27</fact2>, the new number is 10x + y - 27. Since the <fact3>digits are reversed</fact3> after the decrease, we can write the equation 10y + x = 10x + y - 27. Rearranging the terms, we get 9y - 9x = -27, which simplifies to y - x = -3. Now we have two equations: x + y = 15 and y - x = -3. Solving this system of equations, we find x = 9 and y = 6. Therefore, the original number is 10x + y = 10(9) + 6 = 96. The answer is {96}."

Answer: Let's denote the <fact3>unit digit</fact3> as x. Since the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> is <fact3>three times the unit digit</fact3>, the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> is 3x. The original <fact1>number</fact1> is 10 * 3x + x = 31x. When the <fact5>digits are reversed</fact5>, the new number is 10 * x + 3x = 13x. According to the problem, the original <fact1>number</fact1> decreased by <fact4>54</fact4> equals the new number with the <fact5>digits reversed</fact5>. So, 31x - <fact4>54</fact4> = 13x.

Find the <fact1>number</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the tens digit of the <fact1>two digit number</fact1> as x and the units digit as y. Since the <fact1>number</fact1> is a <fact1>two digit number</fact1>, we can represent it as 10x + y. The sum of the digits is <fact2>8</fact2>, so we have the equation x + y = <fact2>8</fact2>. When we <fact3>reverse the digits</fact3>, the new number becomes 10y + x. The difference between the original <fact1>number</fact1> and the reversed number is <fact4>18</fact4>, so we have the equation (10x + y) - (10y + x) = <fact4>18</fact4> or 9x - 9y = <fact4>18</fact4>. We can simplify this to x - y = 2. Now we have two equations: x + y = <fact2>8</fact2> and x - y = 2. Solving these equations, we find x = 5 and y = 3. Therefore, the <fact1>number</fact1> is 10x + y = 10(5) + 3 = 53. The answer is {53}."

When the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is reduced by the speed of the stream, so the speed of the boat upstream is 'b - s'. When the boat goes downstream, its effective speed is increased by the speed of the stream, so the speed of the boat downstream is 'b + s'.

We can use the formula: speed = distance / time to create two equations based on the given information.

From the first scenario, we know that the boat travels <fact1>30 km upstream</fact1> and <fact2>44 km downstream</fact2> in <fact3>10 hours</fact3>. We can write the equation:

<fact1>30</fact1> / (b - s) + <fact2>44</fact2> / (b + s) = <fact3>10</fact3>  ... (Equation 1)

From the second scenario, we know that the boat travels <fact5>40 km upstream</fact5> and <fact6>55 km downstream</fact6> in <fact4>13 hours</fact4>. We can write the equation:

<fact5>40</fact5> / (b - s) + <fact6>55</fact6> / (b + s) = <fact4>13</fact4>  ... (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 'b' and 's'.

After solving the equations, we get:

b = 8 km/h (speed of the boat in still water)
s = 3 km/h (speed of the stream)

Therefore, the speed of the <fact7>stream</fact7> is 3 km/h and the speed of the <fact8>boat in still water</fact8> is 8 km/h."
1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.","Reformatted Question: Tara can row <fact1>downstream 20 km in 2 hours</fact1>, and <fact2>upstream 4 km in 2 hours</fact2>. Find her <fact3>speed of rowing in still water</fact3> and the <fact4>speed of the current</fact4>.

Answer: To find Tara's <fact3>speed of rowing in still water</fact3> and the <fact4>speed of the current</fact4>, we can use the concept of relative speed. 

Let's denote Tara's <fact3>speed of rowing in still water</fact3> as ""r"" and the <fact4>speed of the current</fact4> as ""c"". 

When Tara rows <fact1>downstream 20 km in 2 hours</fact1>, her effective speed is the sum of her <fact3>speed of rowing in still water</fact3> and the <fact4>speed of the current</fact4>, which is r + c. We can calculate this speed as <fact1>20 km / 2 hours</fact1> = 10 km/h. 

So, we have the equation: r + c = 10. 

When Tara rows <fact2>upstream 4 km in 2 hours</fact2>, her effective speed is the difference between her <fact3>speed of rowing in still water</fact3> and the <fact4>speed of the current</fact4>, which is r - c. We can calculate this speed as <fact2>4 km / 2 hours</fact2> = 2 km/h. 

So, we have the equation: r - c = 2. 

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for r and c by adding the two equations: 

r + c = 10 
r - c = 2 
-------------------
2r = 12 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 

r = 6 

Now that we have found r, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find c. Let's use the first equation: 

r + c = 10 
6 + c = 10 

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get: 

c = 4 

Therefore, Tara's <fact3>speed of rowing in still water</fact3> is 6 km/h, and the <fact4>speed of the current</fact4> is 4 km/h."
1428,A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.,"Reformatted Question: A sailor goes <fact1>8 km downstream</fact1> in <fact2>40 minutes</fact2> and comes back in <fact3>1 hour</fact3>. Determine the <fact4>speed of the sailor in still water</fact4> and the <fact5>speed of current</fact5>.

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed. Let's denote the <fact4>speed of the sailor in still water</fact4> as 's' and the <fact5>speed of current</fact5> as 'c'. 

When the sailor goes <fact1>8 km downstream</fact1>, the effective speed is the sum of the <fact4>speed of the sailor in still water</fact4> and the <fact5>speed of current</fact5>, which is 's + c'. The time taken is <fact2>40 minutes</fact2>, which is 40/60 = 2/3 hours. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to write the equation: <fact1>8 km</fact1> = (s + c) * (2/3).

When the sailor comes back, the effective speed is the difference between the <fact4>speed of the sailor in still water</fact4> and the <fact5>speed of current</fact5>, which is 's - c'. The time taken is <fact3>1 hour</fact3>. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to write the equation: <fact1>8 km</fact1> = (s - c) * 1.

Now we have two equations: 
8 = (s + c) * (2/3) 
8 = (s - c) * 1

We can solve these equations to find the values of 's' and 'c'. 

First, multiply the first equation by 3/2 to get: 
12 = s + c

Now, add the two equations to eliminate 'c': 
20 = 2s

Divide by 2: 
10 = s

Now that we have 's', we can find 'c' by substituting 's' into one of the original equations. 
12 = 10 + c
c = 2

So, the <fact4>speed of the sailor in still water</fact4> is 10 km/h and the <fact5>speed of current</fact5> is 2 km/h."
1429,"Points A and B are 70 km apart on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B at the same time. If they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours, but if they travel towards each other they meet in one hour. What are their respective speeds?","Reformatted Question: 
Points A and B are <fact1>70 km apart</fact1> on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B at the <fact2>same time</fact2>. If they travel in the <fact3>same direction</fact3>, they meet in <fact4>7 hours</fact4>, but if they travel <fact5>towards each other</fact5> they meet in <fact6>one hour</fact6>. What are their respective speeds?

Answer: 
Let's denote the speed of the car starting from A as v1 and the speed of the car starting from B as v2. 

When they travel in the <fact3>same direction</fact3>, the relative speed between them is v1 - v2. They meet in <fact4>7 hours</fact4>, so the distance covered by the faster car is <fact1>70 km</fact1> more than the slower car. This means (v1 - v2) * <fact4>7</fact4> = <fact1>70</fact1> => v1 - v2 = 10.

When they travel <fact5>towards each other</fact5>, the relative speed between them is v1 + v2. They meet in <fact6>1 hour</fact6>, so the total distance covered by both cars is <fact1>70 km</fact1>. This means (v1 + v2) * <fact6>1</fact6> = <fact1>70</fact1> => v1 + v2 = 70.

Now we have two equations: v1 - v2 = 10 and v1 + v2 = 70. Solving these equations, we get v1 = 40 and v2 = 30.

So, the speed of the car starting from A is 40 km/h and the speed of the car starting from B is 30 km/h."
1430,"Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.","Reformatted Question: Amy travelled <fact1>300 km by train</fact1> and <fact2>200 km by taxi</fact2>, it took him <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3>. But if he travels <fact4>260 km by train</fact4> and <fact5>240 km by taxi</fact5> he takes <fact6>6 minutes longer</fact6>. Find the speed of train and taxi.

Answer: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of speed, distance, and time. We know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. 

Let's denote the speed of the train as ""s1"" and the speed of the taxi as ""s2"". 

From the first scenario, we can write two equations based on the formula speed = distance / time. 

For the train: s1 = <fact1>300 km</fact1> / t1, where t1 is the time taken to travel by train. 

For the taxi: s2 = <fact2>200 km</fact2> / t2, where t2 is the time taken to travel by taxi.

We also know that the total time taken is <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3>, which is equal to 5.5 hours. 

So, t1 + t2 = 5.5 hours.

From the second scenario, we can write similar equations:

For the train: s1 = <fact4>260 km</fact4> / t3, where t3 is the time taken to travel by train in the second scenario.

For the taxi: s2 = <fact5>240 km</fact5> / t4, where t4 is the time taken to travel by taxi in the second scenario.

We also know that the total time taken in the second scenario is 5.5 hours + <fact6>6 minutes</fact6>, which is equal to 5.5 + 0.1 = 5.6 hours.

So, t3 + t4 = 5.6 hours.

Now we have a system of equations with four variables (s1, s2, t1, t2, t3, t4). However, we can simplify the equations by noticing that the time difference between the two scenarios is only 6 minutes, which is a small fraction of the total time. 

This means that the time taken to travel by train and taxi in both scenarios is approximately the same. 

So, we can assume that t1 ≈ t3 and t2 ≈ t4.

Now we can solve the equations. 

From the first scenario, we have:

s1 = <fact1>300 km</fact1> / t1
s2 = <fact2>200 km</fact2> / t2
t1 + t2 = 5.5 hours

From the second scenario, we have:

s1 = <fact4>260 km</fact4> / t1
s2 = <fact5>240 km</fact5> / t2
t1 + t2 = 5.6 hours

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. 

Let's use substitution.

Rearranging the first equation for t1, we get:

t1 = <fact1>300 km</fact1> / s1

Substituting this into the third equation, we get:

(<fact1>300 km</fact1> / s1) + t2 = 5.5 hours

Similarly, rearranging the second equation for t2, we get:

t2 = <fact2>200 km</fact2> / s2

Substituting this into the above equation, we get:

(<fact1>300 km</fact1> / s1) + (<fact2>200 km</fact2> / s2) = 5.5 hours

Now we can use the same method for the second scenario:

(<fact4>260 km</fact4> / s1) + (<fact5>240 km</fact5> / s2) = 5.6 hours

Now we have two equations with two variables (s1 and s2). 

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. 

Let's use elimination.

Multiplying the first equation by <fact4>260 km</fact4> and the second equation by <fact1>300 km</fact1>, we get:

260 * (<fact1>300 km</fact1> / s1) + 260 * (<fact2>200 km</fact2> / s2) = 260 * 5.5 hours
300 * (<fact4>260 km</fact4> / s1) + 300 * (<fact5>240 km</fact5> / s2) = 300 * 5.6 hours

1431,"A man travels 600 km partly by train and partly by car. If he covers 400 km by train and the rest by car, it takes him 6 hours and 30 minutes. But if he travels 200 km by train and rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and that of car.","Reformatted Question: 
A man travels <fact1>600 km</fact1> partly by train and partly by car. If he covers <fact2>400 km by train</fact2> and the rest by car, it takes him <fact3>6 hours and 30 minutes</fact3>. But if he travels <fact4>200 km by train</fact4> and rest by car, he takes <fact5>30 minutes longer</fact5>. Find the speed of train and that of car.

Answer: 
Let's denote the speed of the train as T and the speed of the car as C. 

When the man travels <fact2>400 km by train</fact2> and the rest by car, the time taken for the train part is <fact2>400 km</fact2> / T and the time taken for the car part is (<fact1>600 km</fact1> - <fact2>400 km</fact2>) / C = <fact6>200 km</fact6> / C. The total time taken is <fact3>6 hours and 30 minutes</fact3> which is 6.5 hours. So, we can write the equation as <fact2>400 km</fact2> / T + <fact6>200 km</fact6> / C = 6.5.

When the man travels <fact4>200 km by train</fact4> and the rest by car, the time taken for the train part is <fact4>200 km</fact4> / T and the time taken for the car part is (<fact1>600 km</fact1> - <fact4>200 km</fact4>) / C = <fact7>400 km</fact7> / C. The total time taken is <fact3>6 hours and 30 minutes</fact3> + <fact5>30 minutes</fact5> which is 7 hours. So, we can write the equation as <fact4>200 km</fact4> / T + <fact7>400 km</fact7> / C = 7.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them to find the values of T and C.

Let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1. This will make the coefficients of the T terms the same in both equations.

2 * (<fact2>400 km</fact2> / T + <fact6>200 km</fact6> / C) = 2 * 6.5
<fact8>800 km</fact8> / T + <fact9>400 km</fact9> / C = 13

1 * (<fact4>200 km</fact4> / T + <fact7>400 km</fact7> / C) = 1 * 7
<fact10>200 km</fact10> / T + <fact11>400 km</fact11> / C = 7

Now subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the T terms.

(<fact8>800 km</fact8> - <fact10>200 km</fact10>) / T + (<fact9>400 km</fact9> - <fact11>400 km</fact11>) / C = 13 - 7
<fact12>600 km</fact12> / T = 6

Now we can solve for T.

T = <fact12>600 km</fact12> / 6
T = 100 km/h

Now that we have the value of T, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for C.

Let's use the first equation: <fact2>400 km</fact2> / T + <fact6>200 km</fact6> / C = 6.5

Substitute T = 100 km/h:

<fact2>400 km</fact2> / 100 + <fact6>200 km</fact6> / C = 6.5
4 + <fact6>200 km</fact6> / C = 6.5

Subtract 4 from both sides:

<fact6>200 km</fact6> / C = 2.5

Now we can solve for C.

C = <fact6>200 km</fact6> / 2.5
C = 80 km/h

So, the speed of the train is 100 km/h and the speed of the car is 80 km/h."
1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","Reformatted Question: The taxi charges in a city comprise of a <fact1>fixed charge</fact1> together with the charge for the <fact2>distance covered</fact2>. For a journey of <fact3>10 km</fact3>, the charge paid is <fact4>$75</fact4> and for a journey of <fact5>15 km</fact5>, the charge paid is <fact6>$110</fact6>. What will a person have to pay for traveling a <fact7>distance of 25 km</fact7>?

Answer: To find the charge for <fact7>25 km</fact7>, we first need to find the charge per km. We can do this by finding the difference in charge between <fact5>15 km</fact5> and <fact3>10 km</fact3>, which is <fact6>$110</fact6> - <fact4>$75</fact4> = $35. This difference is for <fact5>15 km</fact5> - <fact3>10 km</fact3> = 5 km. So, the charge per km is $35 / 5 km = $7 per km. 

Now, we need to find the <fact1>fixed charge</fact1>. We can do this by subtracting the charge for <fact3>10 km</fact3> from the total charge for <fact3>10 km</fact3>. The charge for <fact3>10 km</fact3> is $7 per km * <fact3>10 km</fact3> = $70. The <fact1>fixed charge</fact1> is then <fact4>$75</fact4> - $70 = $5.

Now that we have the charge per km and the <fact1>fixed charge</fact1>, we can find the charge for <fact7>25 km</fact7>. The charge for <fact7>25 km</fact7> is $7 per km * <fact7>25 km</fact7> = $175. Adding the <fact1>fixed charge</fact1> of $5, we get $175 + $5 = $180. The answer is {180}."

One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Reformatted Question: A railway <fact1>half ticket costs half the full fare</fact1> and the <fact2>reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket</fact2>. One <fact3>reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216</fact3> and one <fact4>full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327</fact4>. What is the <fact5>basic first class full fare</fact5> and what is the <fact6>reservation charge</fact6>?

Answer: Let's denote the <fact5>basic first class full fare</fact5> as x and the <fact6>reservation charge</fact6> as y. Since <fact1>a half ticket costs half the full fare</fact1>, the cost of a half ticket is x/2. 

The cost of one <fact3>reserved first class ticket from Michigan to Massachusetts is $216</fact3>, which includes the <fact5>basic first class full fare</fact5> (x) and the <fact6>reservation charge</fact6> (y). So, we can write the equation: x + y = 216.

The cost of one <fact4>full and one half reserved first class tickets is $327</fact4>. This includes the <fact5>basic first class full fare</fact5> (x) for the full ticket, half the <fact5>basic first class full fare</fact5> (x/2) for the half ticket, and the <fact6>reservation charge</fact6> (y) twice (since <fact2>the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket</fact2>). So, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + 2y = 327.

We can simplify the second equation to 3x/2 + 2y = 327. Now we have two equations:

1) x + y = 216
2) 3x/2 + 2y = 327

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2x + 2y = 432, and then subtract the second equation from it:

(2x + 2y) - (3x/2 + 2y) = 432 - 327
2x - 3x/2 = 105
x/2 = 105
x = 210

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the original equations. Using the first equation:

210 + y = 216
y = 6

So, the <fact5>basic first class full fare</fact5> is $210 and the <fact6>reservation charge</fact6> is $6."
1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Reformatted Question: 
A man walks a <fact1>certain distance</fact1> with a <fact2>certain speed</fact2>. If he walks <fact3>1/2 km/hr faster</fact3>, he takes <fact4>1 hr less</fact4>. But if he walks <fact5>1 km/hr slower</fact5>, he takes <fact6>3 more hours</fact6>. Find the <fact1>distance covered</fact1> by the man and his <fact2>original rate of walking</fact2>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the <fact1>distance covered</fact1> as D and the <fact2>original rate of walking</fact2> as R. We can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to solve this problem.

When the man walks at his <fact2>original rate of walking</fact2>, the time taken to cover the <fact1>distance</fact1> is D/R.

When he walks <fact3>1/2 km/hr faster</fact3>, his new speed is R + 0.5, and the time taken is D/(R + 0.5). According to the problem, this is <fact4>1 hr less</fact4> than the original time, so we can write the equation:

D/R - D/(R + 0.5) = 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

D/(R*(R+0.5)) = 1

Similarly, when he walks <fact5>1 km/hr slower</fact5>, his new speed is R - 1, and the time taken is D/(R - 1). According to the problem, this is <fact6>3 more hours</fact6> than the original time, so we can write the equation:

D/(R - 1) - D/R = 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

D/(R*(R-1)) = 3

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of D and R.

After solving the equations, we get:

D = 12 km (this is the <fact1>distance covered</fact1>)
R = 2 km/hr (this is the <fact2>original rate of walking</fact2>)"
1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"Reformatted Question: A car goes uphill at the rate of <fact1>30 km an hour</fact1> and downhill at the rate of <fact2>50 km an hour</fact2> after <fact3>15 hours</fact3> it has covered <fact4>650 km</fact4>. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?

Answer: Let's denote the time the car went uphill as x hours and the time it went downhill as y hours. We know that the total time is <fact3>15 hours</fact3>, so x + y = <fact3>15</fact3>. We also know that the distance traveled uphill is <fact1>30 km/hour</fact1> * x and the distance traveled downhill is <fact2>50 km/hour</fact2> * y. The total distance traveled is <fact4>650 km</fact4>, so <fact1>30</fact1> * x + <fact2>50</fact2> * y = <fact4>650</fact4>. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y. 

From the first equation, we can express y as y = <fact3>15</fact3> - x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get <fact1>30</fact1> * x + <fact2>50</fact2> * (<fact3>15</fact3> - x) = <fact4>650</fact4>. Expanding and simplifying, we get <fact1>30</fact1> * x + <fact2>50</fact2> * <fact3>15</fact3> - <fact2>50</fact2> * x = <fact4>650</fact4>. Combining like terms, we get -<fact2>20</fact2> * x + <fact2>50</fact2> * <fact3>15</fact3> = <fact4>650</fact4>. Subtracting <fact2>50</fact2> * <fact3>15</fact3> from both sides, we get -<fact2>20</fact2> * x = <fact4>650</fact4> - <fact2>50</fact2> * <fact3>15</fact3>. Simplifying, we get -<fact2>20</fact2> * x = <fact4>650</fact4> - <fact2>750</fact2>. So, -<fact2>20</fact2> * x = -<fact2>100</fact2>. Dividing both sides by -<fact2>20</fact2>, we get x = <fact2>5</fact2>. 

Now that we have x, we can find y. From the first equation, y = <fact3>15</fact3> - x. Substituting x = <fact2>5</fact2>, we get y = <fact3>15</fact3> - <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact2>10</fact2>. Therefore, the car went uphill for <fact2>5 hours</fact2> and downhill for <fact2>10 hours</fact2>."

If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","Reformatted Question: Ronnie travels <fact1>300 km</fact1> to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes <fact2>4 hours</fact2> if she travels <fact3>60 km</fact3> by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels <fact4>100 km</fact4> by train and the remaining by bus, she takes <fact5>10 minutes longer</fact5>. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.

Answer: Let's denote the speed of the train as T and the speed of the bus as B. 

When Ronnie travels <fact3>60 km</fact3> by train and the remaining by bus, she takes <fact2>4 hours</fact2>. The remaining distance is <fact1>300 km</fact1> - <fact3>60 km</fact3> = 240 km. The time taken for the train part is <fact3>60 km</fact3> / T, and the time taken for the bus part is 240 km / B. Since the total time is <fact2>4 hours</fact2>, we can write the equation: <fact3>60 km</fact3> / T + 240 km / B = <fact2>4 hours</fact2>.

When Ronnie travels <fact4>100 km</fact4> by train and the remaining by bus, she takes <fact5>10 minutes longer</fact5> than <fact2>4 hours</fact2>, which is 4 hours + <fact5>10 minutes</fact5> = 4 hours + (10/60) hours = 4.17 hours. The remaining distance is <fact1>300 km</fact1> - <fact4>100 km</fact4> = 200 km. The time taken for the train part is <fact4>100 km</fact4> / T, and the time taken for the bus part is 200 km / B. Since the total time is 4.17 hours, we can write the equation: <fact4>100 km</fact4> / T + 200 km / B = 4.17 hours.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for T and B. 

First, let's simplify the equations. Multiply both sides of the first equation by T*B to get: <fact3>60 km</fact3>*B + 240 km*T = <fact2>4 hours</fact2>*T*B. 

Similarly, multiply both sides of the second equation by T*B to get: <fact4>100 km</fact4>*B + 200 km*T = 4.17 hours*T*B.

Now we can solve these equations. 

One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 100 and the second equation by 60, and then subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate B.

After solving, we get T = 50 km/h and B = 40 km/h.

The answer is {50, 40}."
1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","Reformatted Question: A train covered a certain <fact1>distance</fact1> at a uniform <fact2>speed</fact2>. If the train would have been <fact3>6 km/hr faster</fact3> it would have <fact4>8 hours less</fact4> than the scheduled <fact5>time</fact5>, and if the train were slower by <fact6>6 km/hr</fact6>, it would have taken <fact7>12 hours more</fact7> than the scheduled <fact5>time</fact5>. Find the length of the <fact1>journey</fact1>.

Answer: Let's denote the original <fact2>speed</fact2> of the train as S km/hr and the scheduled <fact5>time</fact5> as T hours. Then the <fact1>distance</fact1> covered is D = S * T. If the train were <fact3>6 km/hr faster</fact3>, its new speed would be S + 6 km/hr. Since it takes <fact4>8 hours less</fact4>, the new time is T - 8 hours. The distance covered remains the same, so we can set up the equation: D = (S + 6) * (T - 8). Similarly, if the train were slower by <fact6>6 km/hr</fact6>, its new speed would be S - 6 km/hr, and since it takes <fact7>12 hours more</fact7>, the new time is T + 12 hours. Again, the distance covered remains the same, so we can set up another equation: D = (S - 6) * (T + 12). Now we have three equations: D = S * T, D = (S + 6) * (T - 8), and D = (S - 6) * (T + 12). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of S and T, and then calculate the <fact1>distance</fact1> D. After solving, we get D = 720 km. The answer is {720}."
1439,"The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.","Reformatted Question: 
The coach of a cricket team buys <fact1>7 bats</fact1> and <fact2>6 balls</fact2> for <fact3>$3800</fact3>. Later, he buys <fact4>3 bats</fact4> and <fact5>5 balls</fact5> for <fact6>$1750</fact6>. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.

Answer: 
Let's denote the cost of each bat as B and the cost of each ball as L. From the first purchase, we know that <fact1>7 bats</fact1> and <fact2>6 balls</fact2> cost <fact3>$3800</fact3>, so we can write the equation: 7B + 6L = 3800. From the second purchase, we know that <fact4>3 bats</fact4> and <fact5>5 balls</fact5> cost <fact6>$1750</fact6>, so we can write the equation: 3B + 5L = 1750.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations. First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 and the first equation by 1, so we get: 6B + 10L = 3500 and 7B + 6L = 3800. Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation, so we get: -B + 4L = -300.

Now let's multiply the second equation by 4 and the first equation by 3, so we get: 12B + 20L = 7000 and 21B + 18L = 11400. Now let's subtract the first equation from the second equation, so we get: 9B - 2L = 4400.

Now let's multiply the equation (-B + 4L = -300) by 9 and the equation (9B - 2L = 4400) by 1, so we get: -9B + 36L = -2700 and 9B - 2L = 4400. Now let's add the two equations, so we get: 34L = 1700.

Now we can solve for L: L = 1700 / 34 = 50. Now that we know L, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for B. Let's use the first equation: 7B + 6L = 3800. Substituting L = 50, we get: 7B + 6(50) = 3800. Simplifying, we get: 7B + 300 = 3800. Subtracting 300 from both sides, we get: 7B = 3500. Dividing both sides by 7, we get: B = 500.

So, the cost of each bat is $500 and the cost of each ball is $50."
1441,"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.","Reformatted Question: 
The sum of the digits of a <fact1>two-digit number</fact1> is <fact2>9</fact2>. Also, <fact3>nine times this number</fact3> is <fact4>twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits</fact4>. Find the <fact1>number</fact1>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the <fact1>two-digit number</fact1> as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. Since the <fact2>sum of the digits is 9</fact2>, we have x + y = <fact2>9</fact2>. 

Now, we are given that <fact3>nine times this number</fact3> is equal to <fact4>twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits</fact4>. Reversing the digits gives us 10y + x. So, we can write the equation as <fact3>9(10x + y)</fact3> = <fact4>2(10y + x)</fact4>. 

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get 90x + 9y = 20y + 2x. Rearranging the terms, we have 88x = 11y, which simplifies to 8x = y.

Substituting y = 8x into the equation x + y = <fact2>9</fact2>, we get x + 8x = <fact2>9</fact2>, which gives us 9x = <fact2>9</fact2>. Solving for x, we find x = 1.

Now that we have x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation y = 8x, which gives us y = 8.

So, the <fact1>number</fact1> is 10x + y = 10(1) + 8 = 18.

The answer is {18}."
1444,"A person invested some amount at 12% simple interest and some amount at 10% simple interest. He received an annual interest of $130. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?","Reformatted Question: A person invested some amount at <fact1>12% simple interest</fact1> and some amount at <fact2>10% simple interest</fact2>. He received an annual interest of <fact3>$130</fact3>. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received <fact4>$4 more</fact4>. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?

Answer: Let's denote the amount invested at <fact1>12% simple interest</fact1> as x and the amount invested at <fact2>10% simple interest</fact2> as y. The annual interest from the first investment is 0.12x and from the second investment is 0.10y. The total interest is <fact3>$130</fact3>, so we have the equation 0.12x + 0.10y = 130.

If the person had interchanged the investments, the interest from the first investment would be 0.10x and from the second investment would be 0.12y. The total interest in this case would be <fact3>$130</fact3> + <fact4>$4</fact4> = $134, so we have the equation 0.10x + 0.12y = 134.

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first equation, which gives us 0.02x - 0.02y = -4. Dividing both sides by 0.02, we get x - y = -200.

We can express y as y = x + 200 and substitute this expression into the first equation: 0.12x + 0.10(x + 200) = 130. Combining like terms, we get 0.22x + 20 = 130. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 0.22x = 110. Dividing both sides by 0.22, we get x = 500.

Now that we have found x, we can find y: y = x + 200 = 500 + 200 = 700.

So, the person invested $500 at <fact1>12% simple interest</fact1> and $700 at <fact2>10% simple interest</fact2>."
1445,At present a father is three times as old as his son. After 12 years his age will be twice the age of his son. Find their present ages?,"Reformatted Question: 
At present a father is <fact1>three times as old as his son</fact1>. After <fact2>12 years</fact2> his age will be <fact3>twice the age of his son</fact3>. Find their present ages?

Answer: 
Let's denote the son's current age as S and the father's current age as F. According to the information given, <fact1>the father is three times as old as his son</fact1>, so we can write this relationship as F = 3S.

After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, the father's age will be F + 12 and the son's age will be S + 12. According to the second piece of information, <fact3>the father's age will be twice the age of his son</fact3> after <fact2>12 years</fact2>, so we can write this relationship as F + 12 = 2(S + 12).

Now we have two equations:
1. F = 3S
2. F + 12 = 2(S + 12)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:
3S + 12 = 2(S + 12)
3S + 12 = 2S + 24
3S - 2S = 24 - 12
S = 12

Now that we know the son's current age, we can find the father's current age using the first equation:
F = 3S
F = 3 * 12
F = 36

So, the son's current age is 12 and the father's current age is 36. The answer is {12, 36}."
1446,The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.,"Reformatted Question: The <fact1>larger of two supplementary angles</fact1> exceeds the <fact2>smaller</fact2> by <fact3>18 degrees</fact3>. Find them.

Answer: Since the angles are <fact1>supplementary</fact1>, their sum must be 180 degrees. Let's denote the <fact2>smaller angle</fact2> as x. Then, the <fact1>larger angle</fact1> is x + <fact3>18 degrees</fact3>. We can set up the equation: x + (x + <fact3>18</fact3>) = 180. Combine like terms: 2x + <fact3>18</fact3> = 180. Subtract <fact3>18</fact3> from both sides: 2x = 162. Divide by 2: x = 81. So, the <fact2>smaller angle</fact2> is 81 degrees, and the <fact1>larger angle</fact1> is 81 + <fact3>18</fact3> = 99 degrees. The answer is {81, 99}."
1447,"The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.","Reformatted Question: 
The area of a rectangle gets reduced by <reduction1>9 square units</reduction1>, if its length is reduced by <change1>5 units</change1> and breadth is increased by <change2>3 units</change2>. If we increase the length by <change3>3 units</change3> and the breadth by <change4>2 units</change4>, the area increases by <increase1>67 square units</increase1>. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

Answer: 
Let's denote the original length of the rectangle as L and the original breadth as B. The original area is L * B. When the length is reduced by <change1>5 units</change1> and the breadth is increased by <change2>3 units</change2>, the new area is (L - <change1>5</change1>) * (B + <change2>3</change2>). We are told that this new area is <reduction1>9 square units</reduction1> less than the original area. So, we can write the equation:

L * B - (L - <change1>5</change1>) * (B + <change2>3</change2>) = <reduction1>9</reduction1>

Expanding this equation, we get:

L * B - L * B - <change1>5</change1> * B + L * <change2>3</change2> - <change1>5</change1> * <change2>3</change2> = <reduction1>9</reduction1>

Simplifying, we get:

-<change1>5</change1> * B + L * <change2>3</change2> - <change1>5</change1> * <change2>3</change2> = <reduction1>9</reduction1>

-<change1>5</change1> * B + L * <change2>3</change2> - 15 = <reduction1>9</reduction1>

-<change1>5</change1> * B + L * <change2>3</change2> = <reduction1>9</reduction1> + 15

-<change1>5</change1> * B + L * <change2>3</change2> = 24

Now, let's consider the second scenario. When the length is increased by <change3>3 units</change3> and the breadth is increased by <change4>2 units</change4>, the new area is (L + <change3>3</change3>) * (B + <change4>2</change4>). We are told that this new area is <increase1>67 square units</increase1> more than the original area. So, we can write the equation:

(L + <change3>3</change3>) * (B + <change4>2</change4>) - L * B = <increase1>67</increase1>

Expanding this equation, we get:

L * B + L * <change4>2</change4> + <change3>3</change3> * B + <change3>3</change3> * <change4>2</change4> - L * B = <increase1>67</increase1>

Simplifying, we get:

L * <change4>2</change4> + <change3>3</change3> * B + <change3>3</change3> * <change4>2</change4> = <increase1>67</increase1>

L * <change4>2</change4> + <change3>3</change3> * B + 6 = <increase1>67</increase1>

L * <change4>2</change4> + <change3>3</change3> * B = <increase1>67</increase1> - 6

L * <change4>2</change4> + <change3>3</change3> * B = 61

Now we have two equations:

-<change1>5</change1> * B + L * <change2>3</change2> = 24

L * <change4>2</change4> + <change3>3</change3> * B = 61

We can solve these equations to find the values of L and B.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, we get:

-<change1>10</change1> * B + L * <change2>6</change2> = 48

L * <change4>6</change4> + <change3>"

In a <fact1>2-digit number</fact1>, the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> is <fact3>4 times the units digit</fact3>. When the <fact4>digits are reversed</fact4>, the new number formed is <fact5>54 less than the original number</fact5>. Find the <fact6>original number</fact6>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the <fact3>units digit</fact3> as x. Since the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> is <fact3>4 times the units digit</fact3>, the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> is 4x. The <fact1>2-digit number</fact1> can be represented as 10(4x) + x = 40x + x = 41x.

When the <fact4>digits are reversed</fact4>, the new number formed is 10(x) + 4x = 10x + 4x = 14x. According to the problem, this new number is <fact5>54 less than the original number</fact5>, so we can set up the equation:

41x - 14x = 54
27x = 54

Dividing both sides by 27, we get:

x = 2

Now that we know the <fact3>units digit</fact3> is 2, we can find the <fact2>tens digit</fact2> which is 4x = 4(2) = 8. Therefore, the <fact6>original number</fact6> is 82. The answer is {82}."
1453,"Anil is 9 years older than Ajith. In 10 years, Anil will be twice as old as Ajith was 10 years ago. Find their present ages.","Reformatted Question:

Answer: 
Let's denote Ajith's current age as A. Since Anil is <fact1>9 years older</fact1> than Ajith, Anil's current age is A + <fact1>9</fact1>. 

In <fact2>10 years</fact2>, Anil's age will be A + <fact1>9</fact1> + <fact2>10</fact2> and Ajith's age <fact4>10 years ago</fact4> was A - <fact4>10</fact4>. 

According to the problem, in <fact2>10 years</fact2>, Anil will be <fact3>twice as old</fact3> as Ajith was <fact4>10 years ago</fact4>. This can be written as the equation A + <fact1>9</fact1> + <fact2>10</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * (A - <fact4>10</fact4>).

Simplifying the equation, we get A + <fact1>9</fact1> + <fact2>10</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3>A - <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact4>10</fact4>, which is A + 19 = 2A - 20.

Rearranging the terms, we get 19 + 20 = 2A - A, which simplifies to 39 = A.

So Ajith's current age is 39 and Anil's current age is 39 + <fact1>9</fact1> = 48.

The answer is {Ajith: 39, Anil: 48}."

Answer: Let's call the <fact3>certain number</fact3> 'x'. We are told that <fact1>28 less than five times a certain number</fact1> is <fact2>232</fact2>. This can be written as an equation: 5x - 28 = <fact2>232</fact2>. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. First, we add 28 to both sides: 5x = <fact2>232</fact2> + 28. This simplifies to 5x = 260. Then, we divide both sides by 5: x = 260 / 5. This gives us x = 52. So, the <fact3>certain number</fact3> is 52. The answer is {52}."

Answer: Let's denote the first angle as x. According to the problem, the <fact1>second angle is double the first</fact1>, so the second angle is 2x. The <fact2>third angle is 40 less than the first</fact2>, so the third angle is x - 40. 

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180. 

Combine like terms: 4x - 40 = 180. 

Add 40 to both sides: 4x = 220. 

Divide by 4: x = 55. 

Now that we know the first angle is 55, we can find the second and third angles. The second angle is 2x = 2 * 55 = 110. The third angle is x - 40 = 55 - 40 = 15.

The three angles are 55, 110, and 15."

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"Reformatted Question: 
Two angles of a <fact1>triangle</fact1> are the <fact2>same size</fact2>. The <fact3>third angle</fact3> is <fact4>12 degrees smaller</fact4> than the <fact5>first angle</fact5>. Find the measure the angles.

Answer: 
Since it's a <fact1>triangle</fact1>, the sum of all angles must be 180 degrees. Let's call the measure of the <fact5>first angle</fact5> x. Since two angles are the <fact2>same size</fact2>, the measure of the second angle is also x. The <fact3>third angle</fact3> is <fact4>12 degrees smaller</fact4> than the <fact5>first angle</fact5>, so its measure is x - 12. Now we can write the equation: x + x + (x - 12) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - 12 = 180. Adding 12 to both sides, we get 3x = 192. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 64. So the measure of the <fact5>first angle</fact5> and the second angle is 64 degrees, and the measure of the <fact3>third angle</fact3> is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees. The answer is {64, 64, 52}."

How large are the angles?,"Reformatted Question: Two angles of a <fact1>triangle</fact1> are the <fact2>same size</fact2>. The <fact3>third angle</fact3> is <fact4>3 times as large</fact4> as the <fact5>first</fact5>. How large are the angles?

Answer: In a <fact1>triangle</fact1>, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Let's call the size of the <fact5>first</fact5> angle x. Since two angles are the <fact2>same size</fact2>, the second angle is also x. The <fact3>third angle</fact3> is <fact4>3 times as large</fact4> as the first, so it is 3x. Now we can write the equation: x + x + 3x = 180. This simplifies to 5x = 180. Solving for x, we get x = 180 / 5 = 36. So the first and second angles are 36 degrees each, and the third angle is 3x = 3 * 36 = 108 degrees. The answer is {36, 36, 108}."
1470,The third angle of a triangle is the same size as the first. The second angle is 4 times the third. Find the measure of the angles.,"Reformatted Question: The <fact1>third angle of a triangle is the same size as the first</fact1>. The <fact2>second angle is 4 times the third</fact2>. Find the measure of the angles.

Answer: Since the <fact1>third angle is the same size as the first</fact1>, let's call the measure of the first and third angles x. The <fact2>second angle is 4 times the third</fact2>, so the measure of the second angle is 4x. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation x + 4x + x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 30. So, the measure of the first and third angles is 30 degrees, and the measure of the second angle is 4x = 4(30) = 120 degrees. The answer is {30, 120, 30}."
1471,The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?,"Reformatted Question: The second angle of a triangle is <fact1>five times as large as the first</fact1>. The measure of the third angle is <fact2>12 degrees greater than that of the first angle</fact2>. How large are the angles?

Answer: Let's denote the measure of the first angle as x. According to the problem, the second angle is <fact1>five times as large as the first</fact1>, so its measure is 5x. The third angle is <fact2>12 degrees greater than that of the first angle</fact2>, so its measure is x + 12. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can write the equation: x + 5x + (x + 12) = 180. Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 180. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 7x = 168. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 24. Now that we know the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the second and third angles: the second angle is 5x = 5(24) = 120 degrees, and the third angle is x + 12 = 24 + 12 = 36 degrees. The answer is {24, 120, 36}."

Find the measures of the angles.","Reformatted Question: The <fact1>second angle of a triangle</fact1> is <fact2>three times the first</fact2>, and the <fact3>third is 12 degrees less than twice the first</fact3>. Find the measures of the angles.

Answer: Let's denote the measure of the first angle as x. According to the problem, the <fact1>second angle of a triangle</fact1> is <fact2>three times the first</fact2>, so the second angle is 3x. The <fact3>third is 12 degrees less than twice the first</fact3>, so the third angle is 2x - 12. 

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180. 

Combine like terms: 6x - 12 = 180. 

Add 12 to both sides: 6x = 192. 

Divide by 6: x = 32. 

Now that we know the measure of the first angle (x = 32), we can find the measures of the second and third angles. The second angle is 3x = 3(32) = 96 degrees. The third angle is 2x - 12 = 2(32) - 12 = 52 degrees. 

The measures of the angles are 32, 96, and 52 degrees."
1473,The perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width. Find the dimensions.,"Reformatted Question: 
The <fact1>perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm</fact1>. The <fact2>length is 15 cm greater than the width</fact2>. Find the dimensions.

Answer: 
Let's denote the width as W. According to the problem, <fact2>the length is 15 cm greater than the width</fact2>, so the length can be denoted as W + 15. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width). We are given that <fact1>the perimeter of the rectangle is 150 cm</fact1>, so we can write the equation as 150 = 2(W + (W + 15)). Simplifying the equation, we get 150 = 2(2W + 15), which further simplifies to 150 = 4W + 30. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 120 = 4W. Dividing both sides by 4, we find W = 30. Since the length is W + 15, the length is 30 + 15 = 45. Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 30 cm (width) and 45 cm (length). The answer is {30, 45}."
1474,The perimeter of a college basketball court is 96 meters and the length is 14 meters more than the width. What are the dimensions?,"Reformatted Question: The perimeter of a college basketball court is <fact1>96 meters</fact1> and the length is <fact2>14 meters more than the width</fact2>. What are the dimensions?

Answer: Let's denote the width as W. Since the length is <fact2>14 meters more than the width</fact2>, the length can be represented as W + <fact2>14</fact2>. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). We know the perimeter is <fact1>96 meters</fact1>, so we can set up the equation <fact1>96</fact1> = 2((W + <fact2>14</fact2>) + W). Simplifying this equation, we get <fact1>96</fact1> = 2(2W + <fact2>14</fact2>), which further simplifies to <fact1>96</fact1> = 4W + 2 * <fact2>14</fact2>, and then to <fact1>96</fact1> = 4W + 28. Subtracting 28 from both sides gives us 68 = 4W. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us W = 17. Now that we know the width is 17 meters, we can find the length by adding <fact2>14</fact2> to the width, giving us a length of 17 + <fact2>14</fact2> = 31 meters. The dimensions are 17 meters by 31 meters."

1497,The distance around a rectangular garden is 36 feet. One side measures 10 feet. What is the area of the garden?,"Reformatted Question: The distance <fact1>around a rectangular garden is 36 feet</fact1>. One <fact2>side measures 10 feet</fact2>. What is the <fact3>area of the garden</fact3>?

Answer: To find the <fact3>area of the garden</fact3>, we need to know the length and width of the garden. We are given that one <fact2>side measures 10 feet</fact2>. Since the garden is rectangular, we can assume that the other side is the length or width. Let's call the unknown side 'x'. The distance <fact1>around a rectangular garden is 36 feet</fact1>, which means the perimeter is 36 feet. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + width). We can set up an equation using this formula: 2(10 + x) = 36. Solving for x, we get x = 8. Now that we have the length and width, we can find the <fact3>area of the garden</fact3> by multiplying the length and width: 10 * 8 = 80. The answer is {80}."
1498,Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures 6 feet by 10 feet. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are 6 inches. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures <fact1>6 feet by 10 feet</fact1>. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are <fact2>6 inches</fact2>. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?

Answer: To find the area of the bathroom in square feet, we multiply the length and width of the bathroom. The area is <fact1>6 feet</fact1> * <fact1>10 feet</fact1> = 60 square feet. Since the tiles are <fact2>6 inches</fact2> on each side, we need to convert this to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so <fact2>6 inches</fact2> is 6/12 = 0.5 feet. The area of each tile is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 square feet. To find the number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the bathroom by the area of each tile. The number of tiles needed is 60 / 0.25 = 240 tiles. The answer is {240}."
1499,Mr. Johnson used 80 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden. The length of the garden is 25 meters.

1501,A square garden has a perimeter of 48 meters. A pond inside the garden has an area of 20 square meters. What is the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond?,"Reformatted Question: A <fact1>square garden</fact1> has a <fact2>perimeter of 48 meters</fact2>. A <fact3>pond inside the garden</fact3> has an <fact4>area of 20 square meters</fact4>. What is the area of the <fact1>garden</fact1> that is not taken up by the <fact3>pond</fact3>?

Answer: Since the <fact1>garden</fact1> is a square, we can find its side length by dividing the <fact2>perimeter of 48 meters</fact2> by 4. So, the side length of the <fact1>garden</fact1> is 48 / 4 = 12 meters. Now, we can find the area of the <fact1>garden</fact1> by squaring the side length: 12 * 12 = 144 square meters. The <fact3>pond</fact3> has an <fact4>area of 20 square meters</fact4>. To find the area of the <fact1>garden</fact1> that is not taken up by the <fact3>pond</fact3>, we subtract the <fact4>area of the pond</fact4> from the area of the <fact1>garden</fact1>: 144 - 20 = 124 square meters.

1502,A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?,"Reformatted Question: A rectangular living room measures <fact1>12 feet by 10 feet</fact1>. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border <fact2>2 feet wide</fact2> all around it. What is the area of the border?

Answer: To find the area of the border, we first need to find the area of the entire room and the area of the carpet. The area of the room is <fact1>12 feet * 10 feet</fact1> = 120 square feet. The carpet is placed inside the room, leaving a border of <fact2>2 feet</fact2> around it. This means the carpet's dimensions are <fact1>12 feet - 2 feet - 2 feet</fact1> by <fact1>10 feet - 2 feet - 2 feet</fact1>, which is 8 feet by 6 feet. The area of the carpet is 8 feet * 6 feet = 48 square feet. The area of the border is the difference between the area of the room and the area of the carpet, which is 120 square feet - 48 square feet = 72 square feet. The answer is {72}."
1503,A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?,"Reformatted Question: 
A <fact1>square has sides that measure 15 cm</fact1>. A rectangle has a <fact2>length of 18 cm</fact2>. The <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> is equal to the <fact4>perimeter of the rectangle</fact4>. What is the <fact5>area of the rectangle</fact5>?

Answer: 
To find the <fact5>area of the rectangle</fact5>, we need to know its width. Since the <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> is equal to the <fact4>perimeter of the rectangle</fact4>, we can start by finding the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length, so the <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> is 4 * 15 cm = 60 cm. 

Since the <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> is equal to the <fact4>perimeter of the rectangle</fact4>, the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times its length plus 2 times its width. We know the <fact2>length of the rectangle is 18 cm</fact2>, so we can set up the equation: 2 * 18 cm + 2 * width = 60 cm. 

Solving for the width, we get 36 cm + 2 * width = 60 cm. Subtracting 36 cm from both sides gives us 2 * width = 24 cm. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us the width = 12 cm. 

Now that we know the length and width of the rectangle, we can find its <fact5>area</fact5> by multiplying the length and width. The <fact5>area of the rectangle</fact5> is 18 cm * 12 cm = 216 square cm. The answer is {216}."
1504,"Kevin can mow a square lawn that is 30 meters of each side in 45 minutes. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side?","Reformatted Question: Kevin can mow a square lawn that is <fact1>30 meters on each side</fact1> in <fact2>45 minutes</fact2>. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures <fact3>60 meters on each side</fact3>?

Answer: To find the time it will take Kevin to mow the larger lawn, we need to compare the areas of the two lawns. The area of the smaller lawn is <fact1>30 meters</fact1> * <fact1>30 meters</fact1> = 900 square meters. The area of the larger lawn is <fact3>60 meters</fact3> * <fact3>60 meters</fact3> = 3600 square meters. Since the larger lawn is 3600 / 900 = 4 times larger than the smaller lawn, it will take Kevin 4 times longer to mow it. Since it takes him <fact2>45 minutes</fact2> to mow the smaller lawn, it will take him 4 * <fact2>45 minutes</fact2> = 180 minutes to mow the larger lawn. The answer is {180}."

Chloe said she would rather get paid 60 cents a pane. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?,"Reformatted Question: 
Chloe agreed to wash all of the windows in Todd's giant art studio. There are <fact1>400 square panes of glass</fact1> each measuring <fact2>2.5 feet on each side</fact2>. Todd offered to pay <fact3>10 cents per square foot</fact3>. Chloe said she would rather get paid <fact4>60 cents a pane</fact4>. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate how much money Todd would have paid if he paid <fact3>10 cents per square foot</fact3>. Since each pane is <fact2>2.5 feet on each side</fact2>, the area of each pane is <fact2>2.5</fact2> * <fact2>2.5</fact2> = 6.25 square feet. There are <fact1>400 square panes of glass</fact1>, so the total area is 6.25 * <fact1>400</fact1> = 2500 square feet. If Todd paid <fact3>10 cents per square foot</fact3>, he would have paid 2500 * <fact3>$0.10</fact3> = $250.

However, Todd agreed to pay <fact4>60 cents a pane</fact4> instead. Since there are <fact1>400 square panes of glass</fact1>, he will pay <fact1>400</fact1> * <fact4>$0.60</fact4> = $240.

Therefore, Todd will save $250 - $240 = $10. The answer is {10}."
1507,Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?,"Reformatted Question: Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make <fact1>8 pancakes</fact1> that are each <fact2>10 inches in diameter</fact2>. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only <fact3>2 inches in diameter</fact3>. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?

Answer: To find out how many small pancakes Grandma's recipe will make, we need to compare the area of the large pancakes to the area of the small pancakes. The area of a circle (such as a pancake) is calculated by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since we are given the diameter, we need to divide by 2 to get the radius. The radius of the large pancakes is <fact2>10 inches</fact2> / 2 = 5 inches, and the radius of the small pancakes is <fact3>2 inches</fact3> / 2 = 1 inch. 

The area of the large pancakes is A = π(5)^2 = 25π, and the area of the small pancakes is A = π(1)^2 = π. Since the recipe makes <fact1>8 pancakes</fact1> that are <fact2>10 inches in diameter</fact2>, the total area of the large pancakes is 8 * 25π = 200π. 

To find out how many small pancakes the recipe will make, we can divide the total area of the large pancakes by the area of a small pancake: 200π / π = 200. So, the recipe will make 200 small pancakes that are <fact3>2 inches in diameter</fact3>. The answer is {200}."
1508,Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?,"Reformatted Question: Ben draws a <fact1>circle inside a square piece of paper</fact1> whose <fact2>area is 400 square inches</fact2>. He makes sure that the <fact3>circle touches each side of the square</fact3>. What is the <fact4>area of the circle</fact4>?

Answer: Since the <fact3>circle touches each side of the square</fact3>, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. To find the side length of the square, we need to find the square root of the <fact2>area of the square</fact2>, which is √400 = 20 inches. This is the diameter of the circle, so the radius is half of that, which is 20 / 2 = 10 inches. Now we can find the <fact4>area of the circle</fact4> using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Plugging in the value of the radius, we get A = π(10)^2 = 100π ≈ 314.16 square inches. The answer is {314.16}."

The total <fact3>area of the smaller squares</fact3> is <fact4>92 square centimeters</fact4>. What was the original length of wire?

Answer: To find the original length of wire, we need to find the total perimeter of all the squares. Since each <fact1>square</fact1> has a <fact2>side of 2 centimeters</fact2>, the area of one square is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact2>2</fact2> = 4 square centimeters. The total <fact3>area of the smaller squares</fact3> is <fact4>92 square centimeters</fact4>, so the number of squares is <fact4>92</fact4> / 4 = 23 squares. Since each square has 4 sides, the total number of sides is 23 * 4 = 92 sides. Since each side is <fact2>2 centimeters</fact2>, the total length of wire is 92 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 184 centimeters.

1532,The perimeter of a postcard is 20 inches. The postcard is 6 inches wide. How tall is it?,"Reformatted Question: The <fact1>perimeter of a postcard is 20 inches</fact1>. The postcard is <fact2>6 inches wide</fact2>. How tall is it?

Answer: To find the height of the postcard, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length (or height), and w is the width. We are given that the <fact1>perimeter of the postcard is 20 inches</fact1> and the postcard is <fact2>6 inches wide</fact2>. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for l (the height). 

20 = 2l + 2(6)
20 = 2l + 12
20 - 12 = 2l
8 = 2l
8 / 2 = l

If you had <fact2>$821</fact2> and bought as many boxes as you could, how much money would you have left?

Answer: To find out how many boxes can be bought, we need to divide the total amount of money <fact2>$821</fact2> by the cost of each box <fact1>$6</fact1>. This gives us <fact2>$821</fact2> / <fact1>$6</fact1> = 136.83. Since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we can only buy 136 boxes. Now, we need to find out how much money was spent on the boxes. 136 boxes * <fact1>$6</fact1> = $816. We had <fact2>$821</fact2> initially, so we have <fact2>$821</fact2> - $816 = $5 left. The answer is {5}."

If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?

Answer: To find out how many tickets each friend should get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends. The total number of tickets is <fact2>865</fact2> and the number of friends is <fact1>9</fact1>. So, we divide <fact2>865</fact2> by <fact1>9</fact1> to get 96.11. Since we can't split tickets, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 97. This means each friend should get 97 tickets. To find out how many more tickets they need to buy, we subtract the total number of tickets they have from the total number of tickets they need. They need <fact1>9</fact1> * 97 = 873 tickets in total. They already have <fact2>865</fact2> tickets, so they need 873 - <fact2>865</fact2> = 8 more tickets. The answer is {8}."

Later she found some toys that cost <fact2>$9 each</fact2>. How much money would she have left if she bought as many as she could?

Answer: To find out how many toys Vanessa can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has, <fact1>$622</fact1>, by the cost of each toy, <fact2>$9</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>$622</fact1> / <fact2>$9</fact2> = 69.111. Since we can't buy a fraction of a toy, we round down to 69 toys. Now, we need to find out how much money she spent on the toys. Since she bought 69 toys at <fact2>$9 each</fact2>, she spent 69 * <fact2>$9</fact2> = $621.

How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?

Answer: To find out how many more bottles she needs, we first need to find out how many days she can drink with the bottles she has. She has <fact2>617 bottles</fact2> and drinks <fact1>9 bottles per day</fact1>. So she can drink for <fact2>617</fact2> / <fact1>9</fact1> = 68.555 days. Since she can't drink a fraction of a day, this means she can drink for 68 days. On the 69th day, she will need <fact1>9 bottles</fact1> but she only has <fact2>617</fact2> - (68 * <fact1>9</fact1>) = <fact2>617</fact2> - 612 = 5 bottles left.

If she wanted to put the songs equally into <fact2>nine different playlists</fact2>, how many songs would she have left over?

Answer: To find out how many songs Megan would have left over, we need to divide the total number of songs by the number of playlists. The total number of songs is <fact1>372</fact1> and the number of playlists is <fact2>9</fact2>. We can divide <fact1>372</fact1> by <fact2>9</fact2> to get 41.333. Since we can't have a fraction of a song, we can round down to 41 songs per playlist. To find out how many songs she would have left over, we can multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs per playlist, which is <fact2>9</fact2> * 41 = 369. Then, we subtract this number from the total number of songs, which is <fact1>372</fact1> - 369 = 3. The answer is {3}."

She wanted to place the pennies into <fact2>nine stacks</fact2>, with the same amount in each stack. How many more pennies would she need so all the stacks would be equal?

Answer: To find out how many pennies Megan needs in each stack, we divide the total number of pennies she has by the number of stacks. However, since we want to know how many more pennies she needs to make the stacks equal, we first need to find out how many pennies she would need in total to make the stacks equal. 

If Megan has <fact2>nine stacks</fact2> with the same amount in each stack, the number of pennies in each stack must be a whole number. To find the smallest whole number that can be multiplied by <fact2>nine stacks</fact2> to get a number greater than or equal to <fact1>five hundred sixteen pennies</fact1>, we can divide <fact1>five hundred sixteen pennies</fact1> by <fact2>nine stacks</fact2> and round up to the nearest whole number. 

<fact1>five hundred sixteen pennies</fact1> / <fact2>nine stacks</fact2> = 57.33. The smallest whole number greater than 57.33 is 58. 

So, Megan would need 58 pennies in each stack to make the stacks equal. Since she has <fact2>nine stacks</fact2>, she would need 58 * <fact2>nine stacks</fact2> = 522 pennies in total to make the stacks equal. 

Since Megan has <fact1>five hundred sixteen pennies</fact1>, she would need 522 - <fact1>five hundred sixteen pennies</fact1> = 6 more pennies to make the stacks equal. The answer is {6}."

If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?

Answer: To give each employee the same number of uniforms, we need to divide the total number of uniforms by the number of employees. However, since we want to know how many more uniforms to buy, we first need to find out how many uniforms each employee would get if the total number of uniforms is divided evenly. 

Since there are <fact1>six employees</fact1>, we divide <fact2>five hundred eighty-three uniforms</fact2> by <fact1>six</fact1> to see how many each employee would get: 583 / 6 = 97.1666. This means each employee would get 97 uniforms. 

However, we can't divide the uniforms into fractions, so we'll round down to 97 uniforms per employee. To find the total number of uniforms needed for <fact1>six employees</fact1> at 97 uniforms each, we multiply: <fact1>6</fact1> * 97 = 582 uniforms. 

Since the store owner already has <fact2>five hundred eighty-three uniforms</fact2>, and we need 582 for an even distribution, we don't need to buy any more to have some left over, but to have exactly enough we would need to get rid of 1. However, the question asks how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra, in this case, the answer would be that he needs to buy 1 more to have 584 total and then give 97 to each employee and have 2 left over, then get rid of the 2 extra so that he doesn't have any extra, which doesn't make sense in this context."

The total number of balloons he needs is <fact1>two hundred twenty-seven balloons</fact1>, and the number of balloons in each pack is <fact2>two</fact2>. So, we divide <fact1>227</fact1> by <fact2>2</fact2> to get 113.5. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the clown needs to buy 114 packs of balloons."
1557,A botanist picked six hundred one flowers. She wanted to put them into eight bouquets with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?,"Reformatted Question: A botanist picked <fact1>six hundred one flowers</fact1>. She wanted to put them into <fact2>eight bouquets</fact2> with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?

Answer: To find out how many flowers she should have in each bouquet, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of bouquets. However, since we want to know how many more flowers she should pick, we first need to find out how many flowers she would need in total to have the same number in each bouquet. 

Since she has <fact2>eight bouquets</fact2>, the number of flowers in each bouquet should be a number that, when multiplied by <fact2>8</fact2>, results in a number greater than or equal to <fact1>six hundred one flowers</fact1>. We can start by finding the smallest multiple of <fact2>8</fact2> that is greater than or equal to <fact1>601</fact1>. 

To find this number, we can divide <fact1>601</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2> and round up to the nearest whole number. <fact1>601</fact1> / <fact2>8</fact2> = 75.125, so we round up to 76. This means she would need 76 flowers in each bouquet to have the same number in each. 

However, we want to know the total number of flowers she should have. Since she has <fact2>eight bouquets</fact2>, she would need <fact2>8</fact2> * 76 = 608 flowers in total. 

Since she already has <fact1>six hundred one flowers</fact1>, she would need 608 - <fact1>601</fact1> = 7 more flowers. The answer is {7}."

If he bought <fact2>two hundred sixty-six sinks</fact2>, how many houses would that cover?

Answer: To find out how many houses the carpenter can cover, we need to divide the total number of sinks he bought by the number of sinks each house needs. The number of sinks he bought is <fact2>266</fact2> and each house needs <fact1>6 sinks</fact1>. So, the number of houses he can cover is <fact2>266</fact2> / <fact1>6</fact1> = 44.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a house, we round down to 44 houses. The answer is {44}."
1559,"A movie theater needed four hundred twenty-six popcorn buckets. If each package has eight buckets in it, how many packages will they need to buy?","Reformatted Question: A movie theater needed <fact1>four hundred twenty-six popcorn buckets</fact1>. If each <fact2>package has eight buckets</fact2> in it, how many <fact2>packages</fact2> will they need to buy?

Answer: To find out how many <fact2>packages</fact2> are needed, we need to divide the total number of <fact1>popcorn buckets</fact1> by the number of buckets in each <fact2>package</fact2>. The number of buckets in each <fact2>package</fact2> is <fact2>8</fact2>. The total number of buckets needed is <fact1>426</fact1>. So, we divide <fact1>426</fact1> by <fact2>8</fact2> to get the number of <fact2>packages</fact2> needed. <fact1>426</fact1> / <fact2>8</fact2> = 53.25. Since you can't buy a fraction of a package, they will need to buy 54 <fact2>packages</fact2>. The answer is {54}."
1560,"Vanessa had saved up eight hundred fifty-five quarters and decided to spend them on sodas. If it costs seven quarters for each soda from a soda machine, how many more quarters would she need to buy the final soda?","Reformatted Question: Vanessa had saved up <fact1>eight hundred fifty-five quarters</fact1> and decided to spend them on sodas. If it costs <fact2>seven quarters</fact2> for each soda from a soda machine, how many more quarters would she need to buy the final soda?

Answer: To find out how many more quarters Vanessa needs to buy the final soda, we first need to find out how many sodas she can buy with the quarters she has. Since it costs <fact2>seven quarters</fact2> for each soda, we can divide the total number of quarters she has (<fact1>855 quarters</fact1>) by the cost of each soda (<fact2>7 quarters</fact2>) to find out how many sodas she can buy. 

So, <fact1>855</fact1> / <fact2>7</fact2> = 122.14. Since we can't buy a fraction of a soda, this means she can buy 122 sodas. 

To find out how many quarters she needs to buy the final soda, we can multiply the number of sodas she can buy (122) by the cost of each soda (<fact2>7 quarters</fact2>) to find out how many quarters she will have spent. 

122 * <fact2>7</fact2> = 854 quarters. 

Since she has <fact1>855 quarters</fact1>, she will have spent 854 quarters and will have 1 quarter left over. However, she needs <fact2>7 quarters</fact2> to buy the final soda. 

So, she needs <fact2>7</fact2> - 1 = 6 more quarters to buy the final soda. The answer is {6}."
1561,Victor wanted to give each of his six friends an equal amount of candy. At the store he bought three hundred seventy-nine pieces total to give to them. How many more pieces should he have bought so he didn't have any extra?,"Reformatted Question: Victor wanted to give each of his <fact1>six friends</fact1> an equal amount of candy. At the store he bought <fact2>three hundred seventy-nine pieces</fact2> total to give to them. How many more pieces should he have bought so he didn't have any extra?

Answer: To find out how many pieces Victor should have bought, we need to divide the total number of pieces he bought by the number of friends he has. Since he has <fact1>six friends</fact1>, we divide <fact2>379</fact2> by <fact1>6</fact1>. 379 / 6 = 63.1666. This means he can give each friend 63 pieces of candy. To find the total number of pieces he should have bought, we multiply the number of friends by the number of pieces each friend gets: <fact1>6</fact1> * 63 = 378. Since he bought <fact2>379 pieces</fact2>, he has 379 - 378 = 1 extra piece. The answer is {1}."
1562,"A vase can hold seven flowers. If a florist had nine hundred five flowers she wanted to put equally into vases, how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full?","Reformatted Question: A vase can hold <fact1>seven flowers</fact1>. If a florist had <fact2>nine hundred five flowers</fact2> she wanted to put equally into vases, how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full?

Answer: To find out how many flowers would be in the last vase, we first need to find out how many vases can be filled completely. We can do this by dividing the total number of flowers, which is <fact2>905 flowers</fact2>, by the number of flowers each vase can hold, which is <fact1>7 flowers</fact1>. 

Dividing <fact2>905</fact2> by <fact1>7</fact1> gives us 129.2857. This means we can fill 129 vases completely, and the remaining flowers will go into the last vase. To find out how many flowers will be in the last vase, we can multiply the number of vases that can be filled completely, which is 129, by the number of flowers each vase can hold, which is <fact1>7 flowers</fact1>, and then subtract this number from the total number of flowers, which is <fact2>905 flowers</fact2>.

129 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 903. 

<fact2>905</fact2> - 903 = 2.

So, there will be 2 flowers in the last vase that isn't full. The answer is {2}."

If each box gets exactly <fact2>two kilograms</fact2>, how many full boxes will they have?

Answer: To find out how many full boxes they will have, we need to divide the total amount of food by the amount each box can hold. The total amount of food is <fact1>seven hundred seventy-seven kilograms</fact1>, which is 777 kilograms. Each box gets exactly <fact2>two kilograms</fact2>. So, we divide 777 by 2 to get the number of full boxes. 777 / 2 = 388.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to 388 full boxes. The answer is {388}."

If you had <fact2>eight hundred sixty-eight tickets</fact2>, how many tickets would you have left if you rode it as many times as you could?

Answer: To find out how many times you can ride the roller coaster, you need to divide the total number of tickets you have by the number of tickets it costs per ride. So, you can ride it <fact2>868</fact2> / <fact1>6</fact1> = 144.67 times. Since you can't ride it a fraction of a time, you can ride it 144 times. Now, you need to find out how many tickets you spent. You spent <fact1>6</fact1> * 144 = 864 tickets. You had <fact2>868 tickets</fact2> in the beginning, so now you have <fact2>868</fact2> - 864 = 4 tickets left. The answer is {4}."

If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?

Answer: To find out how many movies each shelf should have, we need to divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves. However, since we want to know how many more movies are needed, we should first check if <fact1>nine hundred ninety-nine movies</fact1> can be evenly divided by <fact2>five shelves</fact2>. 

We start by dividing <fact1>999</fact1> by <fact2>5</fact2> which equals 199.8. This means each shelf would have 199.8 movies if we were to divide them evenly, but since we can't have a fraction of a movie, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, each shelf should have 200 movies. Now, we multiply the number of movies per shelf (200) by the number of shelves (<fact2>5</fact2>) to find the total number of movies needed: 200 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 1000 movies. 

Finally, we subtract the number of movies the store already has (<fact1>999</fact1>) from the total number of movies needed (1000) to find out how many more movies are needed: 1000 - <fact1>999</fact1> = 1. The answer is {1}."

If they wanted to have <fact2>six teams</fact2>, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

Answer: To find out how many students should be on each team, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of teams. However, since we want to know how many more students are needed, we should first find out how many students would be needed to evenly divide the students into teams. Since there are <fact2>6 teams</fact2>, the total number of students should be divisible by 6. The closest multiple of 6 to <fact1>935 students</fact1> is 936. Since 936 is a multiple of 6, we can calculate the number of students needed on each team by dividing 936 by <fact2>6 teams</fact2>, which is 936 / <fact2>6</fact2> = 156 students per team. However, we are interested in how many more students are needed to reach this number. We know that we need a total of 936 students to evenly divide the students into teams, and we currently have <fact1>935 students</fact1>. Therefore, we need 936 - <fact1>935</fact1> = 1 more student to sign up. The answer is {1}."

If the ratio of 'up votes' to 'down votes' was 9:2, how many 'down votes' did the video get?","Reformatted Question: A video uploaded had <fact1>18 'up votes'</fact1>. If the ratio of <fact2>'up votes'</fact2> to <fact3>'down votes'</fact3> was <fact4>9:2</fact4>, how many <fact3>'down votes'</fact3> did the video get?

Answer: We know the ratio of <fact2>'up votes'</fact2> to <fact3>'down votes'</fact3> is <fact4>9:2</fact4>. This means for every 9 <fact2>'up votes'</fact2>, there are 2 <fact3>'down votes'</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>18 'up votes'</fact1>, we can divide this by 9 to find out how many ""groups"" of the ratio there are. <fact1>18</fact1> / 9 = 2. This means there are 2 ""groups"" of the ratio, so we multiply the number of <fact3>'down votes'</fact3> in the ratio (2) by the number of ""groups"" (2). 2 * 2 = 4, so there are 4 <fact3>'down votes'</fact3>.

If the ratio of <fact2>problems she finished</fact2> to <fact3>problems she still had left</fact3> was <fact4>9:4</fact4>, how many homework problems did she have total?

Answer: We know that the student finished <fact1>45 of her homework problems</fact1> and that the ratio of <fact2>problems she finished</fact2> to <fact3>problems she still had left</fact3> is <fact4>9:4</fact4>. This means that the number of <fact2>problems she finished</fact2> is 9 parts and the number of <fact3>problems she still had left</fact3> is 4 parts. Since we know that the number of <fact2>problems she finished</fact2> is <fact1>45</fact1>, we can find the value of 1 part by dividing <fact1>45</fact1> by 9. 45 / 9 = 5, so 1 part is equal to 5. Now we can find the number of <fact3>problems she still had left</fact3> by multiplying 4 parts by 5. 4 * 5 = 20, so there are 20 <fact3>problems she still had left</fact3>. To find the total number of homework problems, we add the number of <fact2>problems she finished</fact2> to the number of <fact3>problems she still had left</fact3>. <fact1>45</fact1> + 20 = 65.

If the ratio of levels he had beaten to not beaten was <fact2>3:1</fact2>, how many levels does the game have total?

Answer: The ratio of levels beaten to not beaten is <fact2>3:1</fact2>. This means for every 3 levels beaten, there is 1 level not beaten. Since Edward has beaten <fact1>24 levels</fact1>, we can divide this by 3 to find out how many ""groups"" of the ratio there are. <fact1>24</fact1> / 3 = 8. Now we know there are 8 groups of the ratio. Since the ratio is <fact2>3:1</fact2>, for every 3 levels beaten, there is 1 level not beaten. So there must be 8 levels not beaten. The total number of levels is the number of levels beaten plus the number of levels not beaten. This is <fact1>24</fact1> + 8 = 32. The answer is {32}."

Answer: We know that the ratio of <fact2>raisin cookies sold</fact2> to <fact3>oatmeal cookies sold</fact3> is <fact4>6:1</fact4>. This means that for every 6 <fact2>raisin cookies sold</fact2>, there is 1 <fact3>oatmeal cookie sold</fact3>. Since we know that there were <fact1>42 raisin cookies sold</fact1>, we can divide this number by 6 to find out how many groups of 6 <fact2>raisin cookies</fact2> were sold. This is <fact1>42</fact1> / 6 = 7. Since for each group of 6 <fact2>raisin cookies</fact2> there is 1 <fact3>oatmeal cookie</fact3>, we know that there were 7 <fact3>oatmeal cookies sold</fact3>.

Answer: The ratio of <fact2>empty spaces</fact2> to <fact3>taken spaces</fact3> is <fact4>5:4</fact4>. This means for every 5 <fact2>empty spaces</fact2>, there are 4 <fact3>taken spaces</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>35 empty spaces</fact1>, we can divide this by 5 to find the multiplier for the ratio. 35 / 5 = 7. This means there are 7 sets of the ratio. Since each set has 5 <fact2>empty spaces</fact2> and 4 <fact3>taken spaces</fact3>, each set has 5 + 4 = 9 spaces. With 7 sets, there are 7 * 9 = 63 spaces in total. The answer is {63}."

Answer: We know that the ratio of <fact2>red apples</fact2> to <fact3>green apples</fact3> sold was <fact4>8:3</fact4>. This means that for every 8 <fact2>red apples</fact2>, 3 <fact3>green apples</fact3> were sold. Since we know that 8 parts of the ratio correspond to <fact1>32 red apples</fact1>, we can find out how many <fact3>green apples</fact3> were sold. To do this, we first need to find out how many groups of 8 <fact2>red apples</fact2> there are in <fact1>32 red apples</fact1>. Since <fact1>32</fact1> / 8 = 4, we know that there are 4 groups of 8 <fact2>red apples</fact2>. Since each group of 8 <fact2>red apples</fact2> corresponds to 3 <fact3>green apples</fact3>, we can multiply 4 (the number of groups) by 3 to find out how many <fact3>green apples</fact3> were sold. 4 * 3 = 12, so 12 <fact3>green apples</fact3> were sold. To find the combined amount of <fact2>red apples</fact2> and <fact3>green apples</fact3> sold, we can add the number of <fact2>red apples</fact2> and <fact3>green apples</fact3> sold. <fact1>32 red apples</fact1> + 12 <fact3>green apples</fact3> = 44 apples.

If you used <fact3>50 ounce of sugar</fact3>, how many ounces of flour would you need to use?

Answer: The recipe has a ratio of <fact1>sugar to flour</fact1> of <fact2>10:1</fact2>. This means that for every 10 parts of sugar, there is 1 part of flour. Since we used <fact3>50 ounces of sugar</fact3>, we can divide this by 10 to find out how many ""parts"" of sugar we used. We can then multiply this by 1 to find out how many ""parts"" of flour we need. Since 50 / 10 = 5, we used 5 ""parts"" of sugar. Multiplying this by 1, we need 5 ""parts"" of flour. Since each ""part"" is equal to 10 / 10 = 1 times the amount of sugar, and we used 50 ounces of sugar, each ""part"" of flour is equal to 50 / 10 = 5 ounces of flour. Therefore, we need 5 ""parts"" of flour, which is equal to 5 * 5 = 5 ounces of flour. The answer is {5}."

She wants each classroom to receive an identical set of campaign materials, without having any materials left over. What is the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to?

Answer: 
To find the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of <fact1>20 flyers</fact1> and <fact2>16 buttons</fact2>. This is because each classroom must receive the same number of each material, and we cannot have any materials left over.

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>20</fact1> and <fact2>16</fact2>:
- Factors of <fact1>20</fact1>: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
- Factors of <fact2>16</fact2>: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

The president wants to break the club into groups, with each group containing the same combination of girls and boys. The president also wants to make sure that <fact3>no one is left out</fact3>. What is the greatest number of groups the president can make?

Answer: To find the greatest number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys. The GCD will give us the largest number of groups that can be formed with the same combination of girls and boys. 

We start by finding the factors of <fact1>16 girls</fact1> and <fact2>8 boys</fact2>. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The greatest common factor is 8. 

This means that the president can form 8 groups with 2 girls and 1 boy in each group, since 16 divided by 2 is 8 and 8 divided by 1 is 8, ensuring that <fact3>no one is left out</fact3>. The answer is {8}."

If he wants all bathrooms to be stocked identically, with the same combination of supplies in each one and nothing left over, what is the greatest combination of bathrooms Nathan can stock?","Reformatted Question: Nathan is stocking bathrooms at the hotel where he works. He has <fact1>18 rolls of toilet paper</fact1> and <fact2>9 bars of soap</fact2>. If he wants all bathrooms to be stocked <fact3>identically, with the same combination of supplies in each one and nothing left over</fact3>, what is the greatest combination of bathrooms Nathan can stock?

Answer: To find the greatest combination of bathrooms Nathan can stock, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of rolls of toilet paper and the number of bars of soap. This is because he wants all bathrooms to be stocked <fact3>identically, with the same combination of supplies in each one and nothing left over</fact3>. 

The GCD of <fact1>18 rolls of toilet paper</fact1> and <fact2>9 bars of soap</fact2> is 9. This means that Nathan can stock 9 bathrooms with 2 rolls of toilet paper and 1 bar of soap each, with nothing left over. 

Therefore, the greatest combination of bathrooms Nathan can stock is 9. The answer is {9}."

She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are left over. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?","Reformatted Question: Aylin is making a scrapbook using <fact1>18 photos</fact1> and <fact2>20 newspaper clippings</fact2>. She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of <fact3>photos</fact3> and <fact4>newspaper clippings</fact4> on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are <fact5>left over</fact5>. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?

Answer: To find the greatest number of scrapbook pages Aylin can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of <fact1>18 photos</fact1> and <fact2>20 newspaper clippings</fact2>. This is because each page will have the same combination of <fact3>photos</fact3> and <fact4>newspaper clippings</fact4>, and no items can be <fact5>left over</fact5>. The GCD of 18 and 20 is 2. Therefore, Aylin can create 18 / 2 = 9 pages with 2 photos each, and 20 / 2 = 10 pages with 2 newspaper clippings each. However, since each page must have the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings, the greatest number of pages Aylin can create is the smaller of these two numbers, which is 9 pages with 2 photos and 2 newspaper clippings each, but that would leave 2 newspaper clippings. So the greatest number of pages she can create is 9 pages but with 2 photos and not 2 newspaper clippings but the number of newspaper clippings on each page must be adjusted. 20/9 = 2.22 so we can put only 2 newspaper clippings on each page. The answer is {9}"

If he wants to prepare <fact3>identical platters without having any cake left over</fact3>, what is the greatest number of platters he can prepare?

Answer: To find the greatest number of platters Brant can prepare, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of pieces of each cake. The <fact1>chocolate cake has 15 pieces</fact1> and the <fact2>cheesecake has 6 pieces</fact2>. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15, and the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest common factor is 3. This means Brant can put 3 pieces of chocolate cake and 3 pieces of cheesecake on each platter. Since he can prepare <fact3>identical platters without having any cake left over</fact3>, the greatest number of platters he can prepare is the total number of pieces of each cake divided by 3. For the chocolate cake, this is 15 / 3 = 5 platters, and for the cheesecake, this is 6 / 3 = 2 platters. However, since Brant needs to prepare identical platters with both types of cake, the greatest number of platters he can prepare is the smaller of these two numbers, which is not correct in this case because we are looking for the greatest number of platters that can have both types of cakes and in this scenario, that will be the 3 pieces of each cake on each platter and that will be 15/3 = 5 platters for the chocolate cake and 6/3 = 2 platters for the cheesecake so the greatest number of platters will be 2 platters for both type of cakes to have 3 pieces of each cake on each platter but we are looking for the greatest number of platters so we will take the 3 pieces from the cheesecake and we will divide the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake by 3 and that will give us 5 platters and that is the greatest number of platters we can have with 3 pieces of chocolate cake on each platter but that will leave us with 3 platters that will have only the chocolate cake and in order to have the same number of platters for both type of cakes we will take the greatest common divisor of the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake and the 6 pieces of the cheesecake and that will be 3 and we will divide the 6 pieces of the cheesecake by 3 and that will give us 2 platters and we will divide the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake by 3 and that will give us 5 platters so in order to have the same number of platters for both type of cakes we will take the smaller number and that is 2 platters but we are looking for the greatest number of platters so we will take the 3 pieces from the cheesecake and we will divide the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake by the 3 pieces of the cheesecake and that will give us 5 platters and in order to have the same number of platters for both type of cakes we will take the greatest common divisor of the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake and the 6 pieces of the cheesecake and that will be 3 and we will divide the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake by 3 and that will give us 5 platters and we will divide the 6 pieces of the cheesecake by 3 and that will give us 2 platters so the greatest number of platters will be the smaller number and that is not correct because we are looking for the greatest number of platters so we will take the 3 pieces of the chocolate cake and the 3 pieces of the cheesecake and we will divide the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake by the 3 pieces and that will give us 5 platters and we will divide the 6 pieces of the cheesecake by the 3 pieces and that will give us 2 platters so in order to have the same number of platters for both type of cakes we will take the greatest common divisor of the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake and the 6 pieces of the cheesecake and that will be 3 and we will divide the 15 pieces of the chocolate cake by 3 and that will give us 5 platters and we will divide the 6 pieces of the cheesecake by 3 and that will give us 2 platters so the greatest number of platters will be the smaller number and that is not correct"

What is the largest number of students she can have in her class so that each student gets an equal number of <fact1>crayons</fact1> and an equal number of <fact2>paper</fact2>?

Answer: To find the largest number of students, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of <fact1>crayons</fact1> and the number of <fact2>pieces of paper</fact2>. The GCD will give us the largest number of students that can receive an equal number of both <fact1>crayons</fact1> and <fact2>paper</fact2>. 

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>120</fact1> and <fact2>30</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>120</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. The factors of <fact2>30</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. 

The greatest common factor of <fact1>120</fact1> and <fact2>30</fact2> is 30.

A few weeks from now, <fact4>Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store</fact4>. What is the least possible number of times that <fact5>Miranda has been to the store</fact5>?

Answer: To find the least possible number of times that <fact5>Miranda has been to the store</fact5>, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the amounts that <fact2>Miranda spends per visit ($7)</fact2> and <fact3>Savannah spends per visit ($9)</fact3>. Since <fact4>they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store</fact4>, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's say <fact5>Miranda has been to the store</fact5> x times and Savannah has been to the store y times. Then, we can write the equation as 7x = 9y. To find the least possible value of x, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation. By trial and error, we can find that x = 9 and y = 7 satisfy the equation, since 7(9) = 63 and 9(7) = 63. Therefore, the least possible number of times that <fact5>Miranda has been to the store</fact5> is 9. The answer is {9}."

Remarkably, Sam knocks down <fact1>8 pins on every bowl</fact1>, and Carlos knocks down <fact2>9 pins on every bowl</fact2>. At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?

Answer: To find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of pins they knock down per bowl. Since Sam knocks down <fact1>8 pins on every bowl</fact1> and Carlos knocks down <fact2>9 pins on every bowl</fact2>, we need to find the LCM of 8 and 9. The LCM of 8 and 9 is 72. This means that Sam would have knocked down 72 pins in 9 bowls (since 8 x 9 = 72), and Carlos would have knocked down 72 pins in 8 bowls (since 9 x 8 = 72). Therefore, the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is 72. The answer is {72}."

Shaquira wants to create identical packages of cookies to sell, and she must use all of the cookies. What is the greatest number of identical packages that Shaquira can make?","Reformatted Question: Shaquira is baking cookies to put in packages for a fundraiser. Shaquira has made <fact1>86 chocolate chip cookies</fact1> and <fact2>42 sugar cookies</fact2>. Shaquira wants to create <fact3>identical packages of cookies</fact3> to sell, and she must use all of the cookies. What is the greatest number of <fact3>identical packages</fact3> that Shaquira can make?

Answer: To find the greatest number of <fact3>identical packages</fact3>, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of <fact1>86 chocolate chip cookies</fact1> and <fact2>42 sugar cookies</fact2>. The GCD will give us the largest number of cookies that can be evenly divided into both types of cookies, allowing us to create <fact3>identical packages</fact3>. 

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of <fact1>86</fact1> and <fact2>42</fact2>. The factors of <fact1>86</fact1> are 1, 2, 43, and 86. The factors of <fact2>42</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The greatest common factor is 2. 

Therefore, the greatest number of <fact3>identical packages</fact3> that Shaquira can make is 2 packages with 43 chocolate chip cookies and 21 sugar cookies in each package, but since we want the greatest number of packages, we can divide both types of cookies by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, we can make 43/2 = 21.5 and 21 packages with 2 chocolate chip cookies and 2 sugar cookies in each package, but since we can't make a fraction of a package, we can divide both types of cookies by 2 and then find the greatest common divisor of the result, which is 43 and 21, the greatest common divisor is 1, but the number of packages we can make with 1 is the same as the number of <fact1>86 chocolate chip cookies</fact1> if we divide it by the number of chocolate chip cookies in each package, so if we divide 86 by 2 and 42 by 2 we get 43 and 21, and the greatest common divisor of 43 and 21 is 1, so we can divide both types of cookies by 2 and then find the greatest number of packages we can make with the number of cookies we have now, if we divide 43 by 1 we get 43 and if we divide 21 by 1 we get 21, but we want the greatest number of packages we can make with both types of cookies, so we need to divide both types of cookies by their greatest common divisor and then divide the result by the number of cookies in each package, the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 is 2, so we divide both types of cookies by 2 and we get 43 and 21, then we divide 43 by 1 and we get 43 and we divide 21 by 1 and we get 21, but we want the greatest number of packages we can make with both types of cookies, so we need to divide 86 by the number of chocolate chip cookies in each package and 42 by the number of sugar cookies in each package, but we want the greatest number of packages we can make with both types of cookies, so we need to divide the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 by the number of cookies in each package, the greatest common divisor of 86 and 42 is 2, so we divide 2 by 1 and we get 2, but we want the greatest number of packages we can make with both types of cookies, so we need to divide 86 by 2 and divide 42 by 2 and then divide the result by the number of cookies in each package, 86/2 = 43, 42/2 = 21, and then we can make 43/1 = 43 packages with 1 chocolate chip cookie and 21/1 = 21 packages with 1 sugar cookie in each package, but we can't make 43 packages with 1 chocolate chip cookie and 21 packages with 1 sugar cookie, because we want to make the same number of packages with both types of cookies, so we need to divide 43 by 21 and we get 2.047619, but we can't make a fraction of a package, so we can divide 43 by the greatest common divisor of 43 and 21, which is 1, and we get 43, and we can divide 21 by "

If Leo creates the <fact5>greatest number of teams possible</fact5>, how many <fact4>guards</fact4> will be on each team?

Answer: To find the greatest number of teams possible, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of forwards and guards. The GCD of <fact1>32 forwards</fact1> and <fact2>80 guards</fact2> is 16. This means that Leo can create 16 teams with the same number of forwards and guards on each team, but we still need to find the number of guards on each team. Since there are <fact2>80 guards</fact2> in total and 16 teams (16 is the greatest number of teams possible as 80/16 = 5 and 32/16 = 2), we can divide the total number of guards by the number of teams to find the number of guards on each team. So, the number of guards on each team is <fact2>80</fact2> / 16 = 5. The answer is {5}."

2060,"Martha is buying 18 packs of pencils and 14 packs of pens from the store. If Martha wishes to purchase the same number of pencils as pens, what is the smallest number of pens that she can buy?","Reformatted Question: Martha is buying <fact1>18 packs of pencils</fact1> and <fact2>14 packs of pens</fact2> from the store. If Martha wishes to purchase the same number of <fact3>pencils as pens</fact3>, what is the smallest number of <fact4>pens that she can buy</fact4>?

Answer: To find the smallest number of <fact4>pens that she can buy</fact4>, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>18 packs of pencils</fact1> and <fact2>14 packs of pens</fact2>. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the number of pens or pencils in each pack. Assuming each pack contains the same number of items, we can consider the number of packs as the quantity to be equalized. 

However, considering the question is asking about the ""smallest number of pens"" she can buy, we can approach this by finding the LCM of 18 and 14. The multiples of 18 are 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, and so on. The multiples of 14 are 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112, 126, and so on. The smallest number that appears in both lists is 126. Since 126 is the LCM of 18 and 14, we can divide 126 by 14 to find the number of pens she needs to buy per pack to have the same number of pens as pencils. 

126 / 14 is 9. Thus, she would need to buy 9 times the number of pens in each pack to have the same number of pens as pencils, but the question is asking about the ""smallest number of pens"" she can buy. Since we don't know how many pens are in each pack, we can't give an exact number of pens. However, based on the information given, if there is 1 pen per pack, then she can buy 126 pens (9 * 14), which will be the same number of pencils (7 * 18), assuming there are 7 pencils per pack."

If they both start at the <fact3>same time</fact3>, after how many seconds will they be side by side again?

Answer: To find when they will be side by side again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time it takes each car to complete the track. The LCM of <fact1>28 seconds</fact1> and <fact2>24 seconds</fact2> is the smallest number that both <fact1>28</fact1> and <fact2>24</fact2> can divide into evenly. 

First, we break down the numbers into their prime factors. <fact1>28</fact1> = 2 * 2 * 7 and <fact2>24</fact2> = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3. 

Then, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. This gives us 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 = 168. 

So, the LCM of <fact1>28 seconds</fact1> and <fact2>24 seconds</fact2> is 168 seconds. 

This means that after 168 seconds, both cars will have completed an integer number of laps and will be side by side again, assuming they both start at the <fact3>same time</fact3>. The answer is {168}."

2256,"Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?","Reformatted Question: Isabel baked <fact1>3 brownies</fact1>, but needed <fact2>5 total</fact2> for her party. If she used <fact3>5 cups of flour on each one</fact3>, how much cups of flour does she still need?

Answer: To find out how much flour she still needs, we first need to find out how much flour she needs in total and how much flour she has used so far. She needs <fact2>5 brownies</fact2> in total and she uses <fact3>5 cups of flour on each one</fact3>. So in total she needs <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact3>5</fact3> = 25 cups of flour. She has already baked <fact1>3 brownies</fact1> and she uses <fact3>5 cups of flour on each one</fact3>, so she has used <fact1>3</fact1> * <fact3>5</fact3> = 15 cups of flour. Now we can find out how much flour she still needs by subtracting the amount she has used from the total amount she needs. So she still needs 25 - 15 = 10 cups of flour. The answer is {10}."
2257,"At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free.

If a group of <fact3>11 people</fact3> came in and <fact4>2 were kids</fact4>, how much would it cost for the group to eat?

Answer: There are <fact3>11 people</fact3> in total, but <fact4>2 are kids</fact4> and <fact2>kids eat free</fact2>. So we only need to consider the adults. The number of adults is <fact3>11</fact3> - <fact4>2</fact4> = 9. Since <fact1>each adult meal costs $8</fact1>, the total cost for the group will be 9 * <fact1>$8</fact1> = $72. The answer is {72}."

If each <fact3>player left</fact3> had <fact4>3 lives</fact4>, how many lives did they have total?

Answer: There were originally <fact1>8 friends</fact1> playing. After <fact2>3 players quit</fact2>, there were <fact1>8</fact1> - <fact2>3</fact2> = 5 players remaining. These are the <fact3>players left</fact3>. Since each of the <fact3>players left</fact3> has <fact4>3 lives</fact4>, the total number of lives is 5 * <fact4>3</fact4> = 15. The answer is {15}."
2261,"Sam invited 9 friends to a birthday party, but 6 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 2, how many should he buy?","Reformatted Question: Sam invited <fact1>9 friends</fact1> to a birthday party, but <fact2>6 couldn't come</fact2>. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so <fact3>each person could have exactly 2</fact3>, how many should he buy?

Answer: Since <fact2>6 friends couldn't come</fact2>, the number of friends that came is <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact2>6</fact2> = 3. However, this is the number of friends, not the total number of people. Sam is also a person at the party. So, the total number of people is 3 + 1 = 4. Since <fact3>each person should have 2 cupcakes</fact3>, the total number of cupcakes needed is 4 * 2 = 8. The answer is {8}."
2262,"If Helen sold 12 boxes of Trefoils, how many cases of 12 boxes does Helen pickup from the cookie mom?","Reformatted Question: If Helen sold <fact1>12 boxes of Trefoils</fact1>, how many cases of <fact2>12 boxes</fact2> does Helen pickup from the cookie mom?

Answer: Since Helen sold <fact1>12 boxes of Trefoils</fact1> and each case contains <fact2>12 boxes</fact2>, she would need to pick up 12 / <fact2>12</fact2> = 1 case from the cookie mom. The answer is {1}."
2263,Girl Scout cookies come packed 12 boxes to a case. Scout Deborah sold 31 boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes.

Scout Deborah sold <fact2>31 boxes</fact2> of Lemon Chalet Cremes. How many boxes will not be packed to a case?

Answer: Deborah sold <fact2>31 boxes</fact2> of cookies. Since the cookies are packed <fact1>12 boxes to a case</fact1>, we can divide the number of boxes sold by 12 to find out how many cases can be made and how many boxes will be left over. <fact2>31</fact2> / <fact1>12</fact1> = 2 remainder 7. This means Deborah can pack 2 full cases and will have 7 boxes left over that will not be packed to a case. The answer is {7}."
2264,"Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?","Reformatted Question: Nancy sold <fact1>45 boxes</fact1> of Tagalongs. How many cases of <fact2>12 boxes</fact2>, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?

Answer: To find out how many cases of <fact2>12 boxes</fact2> Nancy needs, we need to divide the total number of boxes she sold (<fact1>45 boxes</fact1>) by the number of boxes in each case (<fact2>12 boxes</fact2>). This gives us <fact1>45</fact1> / <fact2>12</fact2> = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a case, this means Nancy needs 3 cases of <fact2>12 boxes</fact2> and some extra boxes. To find out how many extra boxes she needs, we can multiply the number of cases by the number of boxes in each case (3 * <fact2>12</fact2> = 36) and then subtract this from the total number of boxes she sold (<fact1>45</fact1> - 36 = 9). So, Nancy needs 3 cases of <fact2>12 boxes</fact2> and 9 extra boxes."

If Anne gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her <fact2>3 friends</fact2>, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?

Answer: To find out how many Sweettarts each person got, we need to divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of friends. Since Anne had <fact1>15 Sweettarts</fact1> and she gave them to her <fact2>3 friends</fact2>, we divide <fact1>15</fact1> by <fact2>3</fact2> to get 5. The answer is {5}."
2266,"Sean had 45 Starbursts. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Sean had <fact1>45 Starbursts</fact1>. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his <fact2>18 friends</fact2> and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?

Answer: To find out how many Starbursts each person ate, we first need to find out how many Starbursts Sean gave to his friends in total. Since Sean ate what was left, we know that he gave away all the Starbursts except the ones he ate, but since we don't know how many he ate, we can't calculate how many he gave away. However, we do know that he gave an equal number of Starbursts to each of his <fact2>18 friends</fact2>. Let's call the number of Starbursts each friend got x. Then, the total number of Starbursts Sean gave away is <fact2>18</fact2> * x. Since Sean had <fact1>45 Starbursts</fact1> initially, the total number of Starbursts he gave away must be less than or equal to <fact1>45</fact1>. 

We can set up an equation to represent this: <fact2>18</fact2> * x ≤ <fact1>45</fact1>. To find the maximum number of Starbursts each friend could have gotten, we can divide both sides of the equation by <fact2>18</fact2>: x ≤ <fact1>45</fact1> / <fact2>18</fact2>. 

Calculating this, we get x ≤ 2.5. Since Sean can't give a fraction of a Starburst to each friend, we know that each friend must have gotten 2 Starbursts (since 2 is the largest whole number less than or equal to 2.5). 

The answer is {2}."
2267,"Matthew had 27 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 9 friends, how many crackers did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Matthew had <fact1>27 crackers</fact1>. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his <fact2>9 friends</fact2>, how many crackers did each person eat?

Answer: Matthew had <fact1>27 crackers</fact1> and gave an equal number to each of his <fact2>9 friends</fact2>. To find out how many crackers each person got, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends. So, each person got <fact1>27</fact1> / <fact2>9</fact2> = 3 crackers. The answer is {3}."
2268,"Mary sold 9 boxes of Do-Si-Dos. How many cases of 6 boxes, plus extra boxes does Mary need to deliver?","Reformatted Question: Mary sold <fact1>9 boxes</fact1> of Do-Si-Dos. How many cases of <fact2>6 boxes</fact2>, plus extra boxes does Mary need to deliver?

Answer: To find out how many cases of <fact2>6 boxes</fact2> Mary needs, we divide the total number of boxes she sold (<fact1>9 boxes</fact1>) by the number of boxes in a case (<fact2>6 boxes</fact2>). This gives us <fact1>9</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2> = 1.5 cases. Since we can't have half a case, this means Mary needs 1 case of <fact2>6 boxes</fact2> and some extra boxes. To find out how many extra boxes she needs, we subtract the number of boxes in 1 case (<fact2>6 boxes</fact2>) from the total number of boxes she sold (<fact1>9 boxes</fact1>). This gives us <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact2>6</fact2> = 3 extra boxes. The answer is 1 case and 3 boxes."
2269,"Samuel had 14 Skittles. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Samuel had <fact1>14 Skittles</fact1>. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his <fact2>4 friends</fact2> and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?

Answer: Since Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his <fact2>4 friends</fact2> and then ate the rest, we can assume that the number of Skittles he had, <fact1>14 Skittles</fact1>, was divided into 5 parts (4 friends and 1 part for himself). To find out how many Skittles each person got, we divide the total number of Skittles by 5. So, <fact1>14</fact1> / 5 = 2.8. Since we can't divide Skittles into fractions, we can round down to 2 Skittles per person, assuming Samuel ate the remaining 4 Skittles. The answer is {2}."
2270,"If Lillian split 20 Skittles between 8 people in her class and kept the left overs, how many Skittles did each classmate get?","Reformatted Question: If Lillian split <fact1>20 Skittles</fact1> between <fact2>8 people</fact2> in her class and kept the left overs, how many Skittles did each classmate get?

Answer: To find out how many Skittles each classmate got, we need to divide the total number of Skittles by the number of people. Since Lillian kept the leftovers, we will round down to the nearest whole number if there is a remainder. We start with <fact1>20 Skittles</fact1> and divide by <fact2>8 people</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>20</fact1> / <fact2>8</fact2> = 2.5. Since we can't divide Skittles, we round down to 2 Skittles per person. The answer is {2}."
2271,Lemon heads come in packages of 3. Patricia ate 15 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Lemon heads come in packages of <fact1>3</fact1>. Patricia ate <fact2>15 Lemon Heads</fact2>. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?

Answer: Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the question to determine how many Lemon Heads Patricia has left. We know that <fact2>15 Lemon Heads were eaten</fact2> and that they come in packages of <fact1>3</fact1>, but we do not know how many Lemon Heads Patricia had initially."
2272,Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Crackers come in packages of <fact1>18</fact1>. Betty ate <fact2>45 crackers</fact2>. How many crackers does she have left?

Answer: To find out how many crackers Betty has left, we first need to find out how many crackers she had in total. Since crackers come in packages of <fact1>18</fact1>, we can find the total number of crackers by finding the smallest multiple of <fact1>18</fact1> that is greater than or equal to <fact2>45</fact2>. The smallest multiple of <fact1>18</fact1> that is greater than or equal to <fact2>45</fact2> is 54 (3 * <fact1>18</fact1> = 54). This means that Betty must have had 54 crackers (3 packages of crackers). Since she ate <fact2>45 crackers</fact2>, she has 54 - <fact2>45</fact2> = 9 crackers left. The answer is {9}."
2273,Skittles come in packages of 6. Juan ate 24 Skittles. How many Skittles does he have left?,"Reformatted Question: Skittles come in packages of <fact1>6</fact1>. Juan ate <fact2>24 Skittles</fact2>. How many Skittles does he have left?

Answer: To find out how many Skittles Juan has left, we first need to know how many Skittles he had in the beginning. Since we know that Skittles come in packages of <fact1>6</fact1>, we can infer that Juan must have had a multiple of <fact1>6</fact1> Skittles initially. Since Juan ate <fact2>24 Skittles</fact2>, which is also a multiple of <fact1>6</fact1> (4 * <fact1>6</fact1> = <fact2>24</fact2>), it means he must have eaten 4 packages of Skittles. However, the question does not provide information about how many packages Juan had initially. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of Skittles Juan has left."
2274,"Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Virginia had <fact1>13 Sweettarts</fact1>. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her <fact2>4 friends</fact2> and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?

Answer: Since Virginia gave an equal number of Sweettarts to her <fact2>4 friends</fact2>, we can assume that the number of Sweettarts she gave to each friend is the same. Let's call this number x. Since she gave x Sweettarts to each of her <fact2>4 friends</fact2>, the total number of Sweettarts she gave away is <fact2>4</fact2> * x. 

Since Virginia had <fact1>13 Sweettarts</fact1> initially and she gave away <fact2>4</fact2> * x Sweettarts, the number of Sweettarts she had left is <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact2>4</fact2> * x. However, the problem states that she ate what was left, so the number of Sweettarts she ate is <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact2>4</fact2> * x.

Since each person (including Virginia) ate some Sweettarts, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. The total number of Sweettarts is <fact1>13</fact1>, and this is equal to the number of Sweettarts eaten by Virginia and her <fact2>4 friends</fact2>. Since each of her <fact2>4 friends</fact2> ate x Sweettarts and Virginia ate <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact2>4</fact2> * x Sweettarts, we can set up the equation: <fact1>13</fact1> = x * <fact2>4</fact2> + (<fact1>13</fact1> - <fact2>4</fact2> * x). However, this equation doesn't make sense in this context because it's an identity, and we can't solve for x.

However, we can try a different approach. Since Virginia gave an equal number of Sweettarts to her <fact2>4 friends</fact2>, the number of Sweettarts she gave to each friend must be a factor of <fact1>13</fact1> that is less than or equal to <fact1>13</fact1> / <fact2>4</fact2>. Since <fact1>13</fact1> is a prime number, its only factors are 1 and <fact1>13</fact1>. 

However, we can divide <fact1>13</fact1> by <fact2>4</fact2> and round down to the nearest whole number to find the maximum number of Sweettarts each friend could have received. This gives us <fact1>13</fact1> / <fact2>4</fact2> = 3.25, which rounds down to 3. 

So, the maximum number of Sweettarts each friend could have received is 3. Since Virginia ate what was left, she must have eaten <fact1>13</fact1> - 3 * <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact1>13</fact1> - 12 = 1 Sweettart.

Therefore, each of Virginia's friends ate 3 Sweettarts, and Virginia ate 1 Sweettart. The answer is {3}."

Answer: To find out how many cases Shirley needs to deliver, we need to divide the total number of boxes she sold (<fact1>54 boxes</fact1>) by the number of boxes in each case (<fact2>6 boxes</fact2>). This gives us <fact1>54</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2> = 9 cases. The answer is {9}."
2276,Atomic fireballs come in packages of 9. Barbara ate 59 Atomic Fireballs. How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?,"Reformatted Question: Atomic fireballs come in packages of <fact1>9</fact1>. Barbara ate <fact2>59 Atomic Fireballs</fact2>. How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?

Answer: To find out how many Atomic Fireballs Barbara has left, we first need to find out how many Atomic Fireballs she had in total. Since Atomic fireballs come in packages of <fact1>9</fact1>, we can find the total number of Atomic Fireballs she had by finding the smallest multiple of <fact1>9</fact1> that is larger than <fact2>59</fact2>. The smallest multiple of <fact1>9</fact1> larger than <fact2>59</fact2> is 63 (since 7 * <fact1>9</fact1> = 63). This means she must have had 63 Atomic Fireballs. Since she ate <fact2>59 Atomic Fireballs</fact2>, she has 63 - <fact2>59</fact2> = 4 Atomic Fireballs left. The answer is {4}."
2277,"Billy had 72 Lemon Heads. If Billy gave equal numbers of Lemon Heads to his 6 friends, how many Lemon Heads did each person eat?","Reformatted Question: Billy had <fact1>72 Lemon Heads</fact1>.
