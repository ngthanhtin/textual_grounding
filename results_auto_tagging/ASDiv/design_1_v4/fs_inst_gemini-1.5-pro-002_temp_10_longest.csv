We need to know how many inches a ""cube"" represents in terms of hair length. Since this information is not provided, we cannot determine the final length of her hair in inches.

However, if we assume that ""cubes"" represents some unit of length, we can say her hair will be 18 cubes + 4 inches. Without more information, we cannot simplify this further. Therefore, her hair will be 18 cubes + 4 inches long.  While it is tempting to simply add the numbers, it would be like adding apples and oranges.

Thanksgiving is coming and Dr. Mary wants to celebrate it by sharing her blessing to different charities. She first went to Oldtown where she donated <fact1>$700.00</fact1> in total to three different nursing homes. If she gave <fact2>$245.00</fact2> to the first home and <fact3>$225.00</fact3> to the second, how much did she give to the third home?

19 children take a minibus to the zoo. They are to sit <fact1>2</fact1> or <fact2>3</fact2> to a seat. There are <fact3>7 seats</fact3>. How many seats will have <fact2>3</fact2> children seated on them?

Let $x$ be the number of seats with <fact1>2</fact1> children and $y$ be the number of seats with <fact2>3</fact2> children.  We know there are a total of <fact3>7 seats</fact3>, so $x + y = 7$.
We also know there are 19 children in total.  So, <fact1>2</fact1>$x$ + <fact2>3</fact2>$y$ = 19.

We have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
$x + y = 7$
$2x + 3y = 19$

We can solve for $x$ in the first equation:  $x = 7 - y$

Substitute this into the second equation:
$2(7 - y) + 3y = 19$
$14 - 2y + 3y = 19$
$14 + y = 19$
$y = 19 - 14$
$y = 5$

So there are 5 seats with <fact2>3</fact2> children.
Then $x = 7 - 5 = 2$, so there are 2 seats with <fact1>2</fact1> children.

Check: 2 seats * <fact1>2</fact1> children/seat + 5 seats * <fact2>3</fact2> children/seat = 4 children + 15 children = 19 children.

The answer is {5}.

Mrs. Hilt traveled a total of <fact1>6,760 miles</fact1>.  Since she finished a book every <fact2>450 miles</fact2>, we can find out how many books she finished by dividing the total distance by the distance per book: <fact1>6760</fact1>/<fact2>450</fact2> = 15.02.  Since she can't finish a fraction of a book, she finished 15 books.  The answer is {15}.

682,"Mrs. Hilt had $4,000 in her savings account. She earned 10% interest each year. If she left that money in the account for one year, how much will she have in the account at the end of that year?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mrs. Hilt had <fact1>$4,000</fact1> in her savings account. She earned <fact2>10%</fact2> interest each year. If she left that money in the account for <fact3>one year</fact3>, how much will she have in the account at the end of that year?


**Answer:**

Mrs. Hilt starts with <fact1>$4,000</fact1>.  She earns <fact2>10%</fact2> interest over the course of <fact3>one year</fact3>.  The interest earned is calculated by multiplying the principal amount (<fact1>$4,000</fact1>) by the interest rate (<fact2>10% or 0.10</fact2>): $4,000 * 0.10 = $400.  Since she leaves the money in for <fact3>one year</fact3>, her total at the end of the year is the initial principal plus the interest earned: <fact1>$4,000</fact1> + $400 = $4,400. The answer is {4400}.

                    Answer:
Let 'x' be the original number of passengers on the bus.  <fact1>7 passengers</fact1> boarded the bus, so the number of passengers increased to x + <fact1>7</fact1>.  Then, <fact2>9 passengers</fact2> got off, decreasing the total to x + <fact1>7</fact1> - <fact2>9</fact2>. We know that the final number of passengers is <fact3>26</fact3>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + <fact1>7</fact1> - <fact2>9</fact2> = <fact3>26</fact3>. Simplifying the left side gives us x - 2 = <fact3>26</fact3>.

**Answer:**

We need to figure out how many washing machines are needed to wash <fact3>200 pounds</fact3> of clothes <fact2>per day</fact2>. Since one washing machine can handle <fact1>28 pounds</fact1> <fact2>per day</fact2>, we can divide the total weight of clothes (<fact3>200 pounds</fact3>) by the capacity of a single machine (<fact1>28 pounds</fact1>) to find the number of machines required:

200 pounds / 28 pounds/machine ≈ 7.14 machines

If <fact2>each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds</fact2>, how many pounds of sand are there in the bag that is not full?

**Answer:**

We are given that there are <fact1>757 pounds</fact1> of sand in total. We are also told that <fact2>each bag holds 65 pounds</fact2>. To find out how many full bags we can fill, we divide the total amount of sand by the capacity of each bag: 757 / <fact2>65</fact2> = 11.646...  This means we can fill 11 full bags.

To find the amount of sand remaining, we can multiply the number of full bags (11) by the capacity of each bag (<fact2>65 pounds</fact2>): 11 * <fact2>65</fact2> = 715 pounds.

Now, subtract the weight of sand in the full bags from the total weight of sand: <fact1>757</fact1> - 715 = 42 pounds.  Therefore, the bag that is not full contains 42 pounds of sand.

The question states that the tank has a capacity of <fact1>32 gallons</fact1>. This means it can hold a maximum of 32 gallons. The company bought a total of <fact2>728 gallons</fact2> of oil.  Since the tank can only hold <fact1>32 gallons</fact1>, and they purchased much more than that amount (<fact2>728 gallons</fact2>), only <fact1>32 gallons</fact1>  would fit into the tank, filling it completely. Therefore, there would be no tank that is *not* full. This question is asking how much *isn't* in a full tank.  Since we are assuming just one tank is being filled and any extra oil is stored elsewhere, there is no oil not contained in a full tank.

The amount of oil purchased beyond the capacity of the tank is <fact2>728</fact2> - <fact1>32</fact1> = 728-32 = 696 gallons. Since all full tanks contain 32 gallons, a single filled 32 gallon tank contains no gallons not in a full tank. 

The answer is {0}.

793,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?","**Reformatted Question:**

A transport company bought <fact1>95 tons</fact1> of oil. A large barrel can hold <fact2>6 tons</fact2> of oil and a small barrel can hold <fact3>5 tons</fact3> of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?

**Answer:**

To minimize the number of barrels, we should maximize the use of large barrels since they hold more oil (<fact2>6 tons</fact2> vs. <fact3>5 tons</fact3>).

Let 'x' be the number of large barrels and 'y' be the number of small barrels. We want to find integer values of x and y such that:

6x + 5y = <fact1>95</fact1>

We need to maximize 'x' while keeping 'y' a non-negative integer.  We can test values of 'x' starting from the largest possible:

* If x = 15: 6 * 15 + 5y = 90 + 5y = 95. This gives 5y = 5, so y = 1.  This is a valid solution. Total barrels: 15 + 1 = 16

* If x = 14: 6 * 14 + 5y = 84 + 5y = 95. This gives 5y = 11. Since 'y' must be an integer, this isn't a valid solution.

* If x= 13: 6 * 13 + 5y = 78 + 5y = 95.  This gives 5y= 17. Not valid.

* If x = 12: 6 * 12 + 5y = 72+ 5y = 95.  This gives 5y = 23.  Not valid.

* if x=11: 6 * 11+ 5y= 66+5y = 95. This gives 5y=29. Not Valid.
* If x = 10: 6 * 10 + 5y = 60 + 5y = 95. This gives 5y = 35, so y = 7.  This is a valid solution. Total barrels: 10 + 7 = 17.

Since we want the *least* number of barrels, and the scenario with 15 large barrels (and 1 small barrel) uses fewer barrels than the scenario with 10 large barrels (and 7 small barrels), the optimal solution is 15 large barrels.

Therefore, they should use 15 large barrels.

A transport company bought <fact1>95 tons</fact1> of oil. A large barrel can hold <fact2>6 tons</fact2> of oil and a small barrel can hold <fact3>5 tons</fact3> of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?

**Answer:**

Let 'L' be the number of large barrels and 'S' be the number of small barrels.  We want to minimize L + S, the total number of barrels, subject to the constraint that all barrels are full and the total oil transported is <fact1>95 tons</fact1>. This gives us the equation:

<fact2>6</fact2>L + <fact3>5</fact3>S = <fact1>95</fact1>

We can try different values of L and see if we get an integer value for S. Since we want the least number of barrels, we should start by maximizing the number of large barrels (because they hold more oil).

* If L = 15, then 6 * 15 + 5S = 90 + 5S = 95. This means 5S = 5, so S = 1.  Total barrels: 15 + 1 = 16.
* If L = 14, then 6 * 14 + 5S = 84 + 5S = 95. This means 5S = 11, which doesn't give an integer value for S.
* If L = 13, then 6 * 13 + 5S = 78 + 5S = 95. This means 5S = 17, which doesn't give an integer value for S.
* If L = 12, then 6 * 12 + 5S = 72 + 5S = 95. This means 5S = 23, which doesn't give an integer value for S.
* If L = 11, then 6 * 11 + 5S = 66 + 5S = 95.  This means 5S = 29, which doesn't give an integer value for S.
* If L = 10, then 6 * 10 + 5S = 60 + 5S = 95. This means 5S = 35, so S = 7. Total barrels: 10 + 7 = 17.
* If L = 5, then 6 * 5 + 5S = 30 + 5S = 95. This means 5S = 65, so S = 13. Total barrels: 5 + 13 = 18.
* If L=0, then 5S = 95.  This means S = 19. Total barrels = 19.


The least number of barrels is 16 (15 large and 1 small).  Therefore, the number of small barrels used is 1.

The answer is {1}.

In order to make the <fact4>least number of pieces</fact4>, how many <fact2>long pieces</fact2> should be cut for?


**Answer:**

To minimize the number of pieces, we should maximize the number of <fact2>long pieces</fact2> cut.

Let 'x' be the number of <fact2>long pieces</fact2> (4 yards each) and 'y' be the number of <fact3>short pieces</fact3> (1 yard each).  We can express the total length of the rope as:

4x + y = <fact1>27</fact1>

We want to find the largest integer value of 'x' that satisfies this equation and results in a non-negative integer value for 'y'.

If x = 6, then 4 * 6 + y = 24 + y = 27. This means y = 3.  So, we have 6 <fact2>long pieces</fact2> and 3 <fact3>short pieces</fact3>, totaling 9 pieces.

If x = 5, then 4 * 5 + y = 20 + y = 27. This means y = 7. So, we have 5 <fact2>long pieces</fact2> and 7 <fact3>short pieces</fact3>, totaling 12 pieces.

Since we are looking for the <fact4>least number of pieces</fact4>, cutting 6 <fact2>long pieces</fact2> is the optimal solution.

The answer is {6}.

**Answer:** To minimize the number of pieces, we should maximize the number of long pieces.  We can cut a maximum of <fact1>27</fact1>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 6 long pieces with a remainder of 3 yards.  These remaining 3 yards can be cut into <fact3>1-yard</fact3> short pieces.  Thus, there will be 6 long pieces and 3 short pieces, totaling 9 pieces.  To obtain the least number of pieces (<fact4>least number of pieces</fact4>), we cut 3 short pieces.

801,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mr. Lee wants to load <fact1>134 tons</fact1> of his fruits. A <fact2>large truck</fact2> can load <fact3>15 tons</fact3> of fruits and <fact4>small truck</fact4> can load <fact5>7 tons</fact5>. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many <fact2>large trucks</fact2> should be used?


**Answer:**

Let's consider the number of large trucks used as 'L' and the number of small trucks used as 'S'.  We want to minimize L + S, given that 15L + 7S = <fact1>134</fact1>.  Also, since we are looking for fully occupied trucks, both L and S must be integers.

If we use 8 <fact2>large trucks</fact2>, they can carry 8 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 120 tons. This leaves <fact1>134</fact1> - 120 = 14 tons. Since 14 is a multiple of <fact5>7</fact5> (14 = 2 * <fact5>7</fact5>), we can carry the remaining 14 tons with 2 <fact4>small trucks</fact4>. This gives us a total of 8 + 2 = 10 trucks.

If we use 9 <fact2>large trucks</fact2>, they can carry 9 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 135 tons, which is more than the <fact1>134 tons</fact1> we need.

Let's check other possibilities. If we use 7 large trucks, we have 7 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 105 tons, leaving <fact1>134</fact1> - 105 = 29 tons. Since 29 is not divisible by <fact5>7</fact5>, we cannot fully load small trucks with the remainder.  Similar issues will arise with fewer large trucks.

Therefore, to minimize the number of trucks used and ensure they are fully loaded, Mr. Lee should use 8 <fact2>large trucks</fact2>.


The answer is {8}.

Let L be the number of large trucks and S be the number of small trucks. We want to minimize L + S such that 15L + 7S = <fact1>134</fact1>.  We can express this as S = (<fact1>134</fact1> - 15L)/<fact5>7</fact5>. Since we want the number of trucks to be integers, we need to find an integer value for L such that 134 - 15L is divisible by 7.

If L = 0, S = 134/7 = 19.14... (Not an integer)
If L = 1, S = (134 - 15)/7 = 119/7 = 17
Since 1 large truck and 17 small trucks satisfy the condition, and we wish to minimize the total number of trucks used, this is likely the optimal solution. 

To be sure, let's test other values of L:
If L = 2, S = (134 - 30)/7 = 104/7 = 14.85... (Not an integer)
If L = 3, S = (134 - 45)/7 = 89/7 = 12.71... (Not an integer)
If L = 4, S = (134 - 60)/7 = 74/7 = 10.57... (Not an integer)
If L = 5, S = (134 - 75)/7 = 59/7 = 8.42... (Not an integer)
If L = 6, S = (134 - 90)/7 = 44/7 = 6.28... (Not an integer)
If L = 7, S = (134 - 105)/7 = 29/7 = 4.14... (Not an integer)
If L = 8, S = (134 - 120)/7 = 14/7 = 2

So another valid combination is 8 <fact2>large trucks</fact2> and 2 <fact4>small trucks</fact4>.
In this case, 8 + 2 = 10 trucks are used.

Comparing the two valid combinations:
1 large truck + 17 small trucks = 18 trucks total.
8 large trucks + 2 small trucks = 10 trucks total.

Since we want the fewest number of trucks, we should use 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks. The question asks for the number of small trucks used, so the answer is 2.

**Answer:**

To find out how many pieces of ribbon Sam made, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (<fact1>3,730 cm</fact1>) by the length of each piece (<fact2>73 cm</fact2>).  

3730 / 73 = 51.09

Since Sam cut the ribbon into equal pieces, he could not have made a fraction of a piece. Therefore, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Sam made 51 pieces of <fact2>73 cm</fact2> ribbon. The answer is {51}.

Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a <fact1>3,730-cm</fact1> long ribbon. If each piece was <fact2>73 cm</fact2> long, how much of the original ribbon was left?


**Answer:**

The total length of the ribbon is <fact1>3730 cm</fact1>.  Each piece cut has a length of <fact2>73 cm</fact2>.  To find out how many pieces Sam cut, we divide the total length by the length of each piece: 3730 / 73 = 51.1 (approximately).  Since Sam can only cut whole pieces, he cut 51 pieces.

The total length of ribbon used is the number of pieces multiplied by the length of each piece: 51 * <fact2>73 cm</fact2> = 3723 cm.

To find the remaining length, we subtract the used length from the original length: <fact1>3730 cm</fact1> - 3723 cm = 7 cm.

Therefore, 7 cm of ribbon was left.  The answer is {7}.

**Answer:**

Let 'L' be the number of large rooms and 'S' be the number of small rooms.
We are given that the total number of people is <fact1>26</fact1>. Each large room holds <fact2>3 people</fact2> and each small room holds <fact3>2 people</fact3>.  We want to minimize L + S.

We can write the equation: 3L + 2S = <fact1>26</fact1>

We can try different values of L to find the smallest number of rooms:

* If L = 0, 2S = 26, S = 13. Total rooms = 0 + 13 = 13
* If L = 1, 3 + 2S = 26, 2S = 23, S = 11.5 (not possible since we need whole numbers of rooms)
* If L = 2, 6 + 2S = 26, 2S = 20, S = 10. Total rooms = 2 + 10 = 12
* If L = 3, 9 + 2S = 26, 2S = 17, S = 8.5 (not possible)
* If L = 4, 12 + 2S = 26, 2S = 14, S = 7. Total rooms = 4 + 7 = 11
* If L = 5, 15 + 2S = 26, 2S = 11, S = 5.5 (not possible)
* If L = 6, 18 + 2S = 26, 2S = 8, S = 4. Total rooms = 6 + 4 = 10
* If L = 7, 21 + 2S = 26, 2S = 5, S = 2.5 (not possible)
* If L = 8, 24 + 2S = 26, 2S = 2, S = 1. Total rooms = 8 + 1 = 9


We see that renting 8 large rooms and 1 small room gives the least number of total rooms (9).

Therefore, they should rent 8 large rooms. The answer is {8}.

**Answer:**

Let 'l' be the number of large rooms and 's' be the number of small rooms.
We are given that the total number of people is <fact1>26</fact1>.  Each large room holds <fact2>3 people</fact2> and each small room holds <fact3>2 people</fact3>.  We can represent this with the equation:

3l + 2s = <fact1>26</fact1>

We want to minimize the total number of rooms (l + s) while ensuring both l and s are non-negative integers. We can test different values of 'l' to find the solution.

* If l = 0, then 2s = 26, so s = 13.  Total rooms: 0 + 13 = 13
* If l = 1, then 3 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 23, which doesn't give an integer solution for 's'.
* If l = 2, then 6 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 20, so s = 10. Total rooms: 2 + 10 = 12
* If l = 3, then 9 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 17, which doesn't give an integer solution for 's'.
* If l = 4, then 12 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 14, so s = 7. Total rooms: 4 + 7 = 11
* If l = 5, then 15 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 11, which doesn't give an integer solution for 's'.
* If l = 6, then 18 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 8, so s = 4. Total rooms: 6 + 4 = 10
* If l = 7, then 21 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 5, which doesn't give an integer solution for 's'.
* If l = 8, then 24 + 2s = 26, so 2s = 2, so s = 1. Total rooms: 8 + 1 = 9

Since we are looking for the least number of rooms, and we've found a solution with 9 rooms (8 large and 1 small), we don't need to check further. 

Therefore, they should rent 1 small room. The answer is {1}.

Mr. Lee harvested <fact1>495 apples</fact1> and packed them into baskets with <fact2>25 apples</fact2> in each basket.  To find the number of baskets, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket: <fact1>495</fact1> / <fact2>25</fact2> = 19.8.

                         Answer:
Let 'x' be the number of large groups and 'y' be the number of small groups.  We want to minimize x + y subject to the constraint that <fact2>7</fact2>x + <fact3>3</fact3>y = <fact1>90</fact1>.

We can rewrite the equation as y = (90 - 7x) / 3. Since x and y must be integers (you can't have half a group), we need 90 - 7x to be divisible by 3.  

Let's test values of x:

* If x = 0, y = 30. Total groups: 30.
* If x = 3, y = 23. Total groups: 26.
* If x = 6, y = 16. Total groups: 22.
* If x = 9, y = 9. Total groups: 18.
* If x = 12, y = 2. Total groups: 14.

Since we are asked for the number of large groups that leads to the *least* number of groups (<fact4>least number of groups</fact4>), we should have 12 large groups.

                    Answer:                         

Let 'x' be the number of large groups and 'y' be the number of small groups.
We are given that the total number of members is <fact1>90</fact1>.  Therefore, we have the equation:
<fact2>7</fact2>x + <fact3>3</fact3>y = <fact1>90</fact1>

We want to minimize x + y, which represents the total number of groups (<fact4>least number of groups</fact4>).

We can rewrite the equation as:
y = (90 - 7x) / 3
Since x and y must be integers (we can't have fractions of groups), we need (90 - 7x) to be divisible by 3.

We can test values of x starting from 0:
If x = 0, y = 30. Total groups: 30
If x = 3, y = 23. Total groups: 26
If x = 6, y = 16. Total groups: 22
If x = 9, y = 9. Total groups: 18
If x = 12, y = 2. Total groups: 14

Since we want the least number of groups (<fact4>least number of groups</fact4>), we choose x = 12 and y = 2.
Therefore, 2 small groups should be made. The answer is {2}.

**Answer:**

Anna poured the <fact1>1,050 ml</fact1> of tea into cups that each held <fact2>65 ml</fact2>.  First, we figure out how many full cups she could pour: 1,050 / 65 = 16 cups with a remainder. To find the remainder (and thus the amount left in the pot), we multiply the number of full cups (16) by the amount in each cup (<fact2>65 ml</fact2>): 16 * 65 = 1040 ml.  We subtract this amount from the original amount of tea (<fact1>1,050 ml</fact1>): 1,050 - 1040 = 10 ml. Therefore, there were 10 ml of tea left in the pot. The answer is {10}.

If she wants to make <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2> with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?

**Answer:**

Betty wants to make <fact2>15 necklaces</fact2>.  If she uses her <fact1>367 beads</fact1> equally, each necklace will have 367 / 15 = 24 beads with a remainder of 7 beads leftover.  Since she wants each necklace to have the same number of beads, we consider only the whole number quotient, 24.  To have 15 necklaces with 24 beads each, she needs 15 * 24 = 360 beads.

Since she wants to use *all* her beads, she will want all 15 necklaces to have the same number, meaning they need at least 25 beads each (since she has a remainder of 7 after making necklaces of 24 beads). So she needs 15 necklaces * 25 beads/necklace = 375 beads.

To find out how many more cups are needed, subtract the current number of cups (<fact1>315</fact1>) from the required number of cups (<fact2>218</fact2> * 1 cup/student = 218 cups): 218 - <fact1>315</fact1> = -97. Since the result is negative, it means we don't need more cups. It seems there was a mistake in understanding the problem. Let's rephrase it.

If each of the students receives one cup, there are 315 - 218 = 97 cups remaining.  However, the question asks how many *more* cups are needed so that each student can receive the *same*, whole number of cups *greater than one*.
Since there are 218 students, to give each student two cups, we would need 218 * 2 = 436 cups.
Currently, we have 315 cups. Therefore we need 436 - 315 = 121 more cups.

The answer is {121}.

821,"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Sam has <fact1>389 riddles</fact1> for <fact2>18</fact2> of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?

                    Answer:                         

If Sam has <fact1>389 riddles</fact1> and wants to distribute them equally among his <fact2>18 students</fact2>, we first divide 389 by 18: 389 / <fact2>18</fact2> = 21 with a remainder of 11.  This means each student would get 21 riddles, and there would be 11 left over.  Since he wants them to have the same number, he needs to add enough riddles so that the total number is divisible by <fact2>18</fact2>.  The next multiple of 18 after 389 is 18 * 22 = 396. So, he needs 396 - <fact1>389</fact1> = 7 more riddles.  The answer is {7}.

If it wants to distribute them <fact2>equally</fact2> into <fact3>35 classrooms</fact3>, how many more chairs should be purchased?

**Answer:**

The school wants to divide <fact1>1,093 chairs</fact1> <fact2>equally</fact2> among <fact3>35 classrooms</fact3>.  1093 / 35 = 31 with a remainder of 8. This means each classroom would get 31 chairs. Since the school wants to distribute them <fact2>equally</fact2>, they need to purchase enough chairs so that the total number is divisible by <fact3>35</fact3>. The next multiple of 35 after 1093 is 35 * 32 = 1120. The school needs to purchase 1120 - <fact1>1093</fact1> = 27 more chairs. Therefore, the answer is {27}.

831,The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,"**Reformatted Question:** The weight of <fact1>2 bags of chips</fact1> is <fact2>800 g</fact2>. The total weight of <fact3>5 such bags of chips</fact3> and <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact5>2 kg 200 g</fact5>. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?

**Answer:**

1. **Weight of one bag of chips:** Since <fact1>2 bags of chips</fact1> weigh <fact2>800 g</fact2>, one bag of chips weighs 800 g / 2 = 400 g.

2. **Weight of 5 bags of chips:** <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3> would weigh 5 * 400 g = 2000 g.

3. **Weight of 4 bottles of juice:** The total weight of <fact3>5 bags of chips</fact3> and <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> is <fact5>2 kg 200 g</fact5>, which is equal to 2200 g.  Since 5 bags of chips weigh 2000 g, the <fact4>4 bottles of juice</fact4> must weigh 2200 g - 2000 g = 200 g.

4. **Weight of one bottle of juice:**  One bottle of juice weighs 200 g / 4 = 50 g.

5. **Difference in weight:** One bag of chips (400 g) is heavier than one bottle of juice (50 g) by 400 g - 50 g = 350 g.

Therefore, a bag of chips is 350 g heavier than a bottle of juice. {350}

                         Answer:
From ""<fact1>5 diamonds</fact1> weigh <fact2>100g</fact2>"", we can find the weight of one diamond: 100g / 5 = 20g.

From ""<fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> weigh 4 * 20g = 80g.
From ""<fact3>4 diamonds</fact3> and <fact4>2 jades</fact4> is <fact5>140g</fact5>"", we know that the 2 jades weigh 140g - 80g = 60g.
Therefore, one jade weighs 60g / 2 = 30g.

The difference in weight between a jade and a diamond is 30g - 20g = 10g.

So a jade is 10g heavier than a diamond.  The answer is {10}.

The ratio of boys to girls in a kindergarten is <fact1>2:3</fact1>. If the number of <fact2>boys</fact2> is <fact3>12</fact3>, find the number of girls.

Let 'b' represent the number of <fact2>boys</fact2> and 'g' represent the number of girls.
The given ratio of <fact2>boys</fact2> to girls is <fact1>2:3</fact1>, which can be written as b/g = <fact1>2/3</fact1>.
We are given that the number of <fact2>boys</fact2> is <fact3>12</fact3>, so b = <fact3>12</fact3>.
Substituting b = <fact3>12</fact3> into the ratio equation, we get <fact3>12</fact3>/g = <fact1>2/3</fact1>.
Cross-multiplying gives us 2g = <fact3>12</fact3> * 3 = 36.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get g = 36/2 = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 girls in the kindergarten. The answer is {18}.

How many of each should he buy so there are an equal number of balloons, horns and candy bars in each basket?

We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 10, and 8.

First, find the prime factorization of each number:
<fact1>20 = 2 x 2 x 5</fact1>
<fact2>10 = 2 x 5</fact2>
<fact3>8 = 2 x 2 x 2</fact3>

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers.  In this case: 2^3 * 5 = 40

So, he needs to have 40 of each item.

Balloons: 40 balloons / <fact1>20 balloons/bag</fact1> = 2 bags
Horns: 40 horns / <fact2>10 horns/bag</fact2> = 4 bags

If I put <fact4>the same number of plants in each row</fact4> and <fact5>each row has only one type of plant</fact5>, what is <fact6>the greatest number of plants</fact6> I can put in one row?

**Answer:**

This question is asking for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of each type of plant (<fact1>45</fact1>, <fact2>81</fact2>, and <fact3>63</fact3>).  Because of the requirement that each row has only one type of plant (<fact5>), we need a number that divides evenly into each of these quantities. We are looking for the *greatest* number (<fact6>) that does this.

The factors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45.
The factors of 81 are 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81.
The factors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63.

The common factors of 45, 81, and 63 are 1, 3, and 9.  The greatest of these is 9. Therefore, the greatest number of plants I can put in one row (<fact4>, <fact6>) is 9.

873,"A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?","**Reformatted Question:** A full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>. If the last full moon occurred on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>?

**Answer:**
Since a full moon occurs every <fact1>30 days</fact1>, we need to find a multiple of <fact1>30</fact1> that is also a multiple of 7 (the number of days in a week) so that it falls on the same day of the week (<fact2>Friday</fact2>).

We are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 7.

The prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.

The LCM of 30 and 7 is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210.

Therefore, it will take 210 days for the full moon to occur again on a <fact2>Friday</fact2>. The answer is {210}.

874,Ricky has a magic money box. Every day the box doubles the number of coins placed inside of it. Ricky put in 3 pennies on Monday. He looked inside his box on Friday. How many pennies did Ricky see?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Ricky has a magic money box. Every day the box <fact1>doubles</fact1> the number of coins placed inside of it. Ricky put in <fact2>3 pennies</fact2> on <fact3>Monday</fact3>. He looked inside his box on <fact4>Friday</fact4>. How many pennies did Ricky see?


**Answer:**

From <fact3>Monday</fact3> to <fact4>Friday</fact4>, there are 4 days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday).

Since the money box <fact1>doubles</fact1> the coins each day:

* **Monday:** <fact2>3</fact2> pennies
* **Tuesday:** 3 * 2 = 6 pennies
* **Wednesday:** 6 * 2 = 12 pennies
* **Thursday:** 12 * 2 = 24 pennies
* **Friday:** 24 * 2 = 48 pennies

Therefore, Ricky saw 48 pennies on Friday. The answer is {48}.

My number machine will <fact1>add 15</fact1> to a number and then <fact2>subtract 6</fact2> from the sum. If I <fact3>put in the number 68</fact3>, what number will come out of the machine?


**Answer:**

If the number machine <fact1>adds 15</fact1> to the input number (<fact3>68</fact3>), the sum will be 68 + 15 = 83.  Then, the machine <fact2>subtracts 6</fact2> from this sum.  So, the final output will be 83 - 6 = 77. The answer is {77}.

I put another number into my machine. The machine <fact1>added 15</fact1> and then <fact2>subtracted 6</fact2>. The number <fact3>35 came out</fact3> of the machine. What number did I put in?


**Answer:**

Let's call the unknown input number ""x"".  The machine first <fact1>added 15 to x</fact1>, resulting in x + 15. Then, the machine <fact2>subtracted 6</fact2> from this result, giving us (x + 15) - 6. We know that the final output was <fact3>35</fact3>. So, we can write the equation:

(x + 15) - 6 = <fact3>35</fact3>

Simplifying the left side, we get:

x + 9 = 35

To solve for x, we subtract 9 from both sides:

x = 35 - 9
x = 26

So, the number you put into the machine was 26.

The number <fact3>27</fact3> came out of the machine. What number do you think Jordon put in her machine?

**Answer:**

Let's call the number Jordon put into the machine ""x"". 

The machine <fact1>doubled</fact1> the number, so we have 2*x.

Then, the machine <fact2>added 3</fact2>, giving us 2*x + 3.

We know the result was <fact3>27</fact3>, so we can write the equation:

2*x + 3 = 27

To solve for x, we first subtract 3 from both sides:

2*x = 27 - 3
2*x = 24

Then, divide both sides by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, Jordon put the number 12 into her machine. The answer is {12}.

Drew gave <fact1>12 marbles</fact1> to Marcus. Each boy then had <fact2>25 marbles</fact2>. How many more marbles did Drew have than Marcus at first?

Drew gave <fact1>12</fact1> marbles to Marcus, so before that, Drew had <fact2>25</fact2> + <fact1>12</fact1> = 37 marbles.  Since Marcus ended up with <fact2>25</fact2> marbles after receiving the <fact1>12</fact1> from Drew, he originally had <fact2>25</fact2> - <fact1>12</fact1> = 13 marbles.

**Answer:**

The sum of all four numbers is <fact1>19</fact1> + <fact2>23</fact2> + <fact3>34</fact3> + <fact4>38</fact4> = 114.

Since the sum of the remaining numbers after Harry removed one was <fact5>76</fact5>, the number Harry removed must be the difference between the total sum and the sum of the remaining numbers.

How many dimes does Anna have?

**Answer:**

Let 'n' represent the number of nickels and 'd' represent the number of dimes.

From the question, we know two things:

1. **Total coins:**  Anna has a total of <fact1>28</fact1> nickels and dimes.  This can be written as:  n + d = <fact1>28</fact1>

2. **Nickel/Dime Relationship:** She has <fact2>8 fewer nickels than dimes</fact2>. This can be written as: n = d - <fact2>8</fact2>

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(d - <fact2>8</fact2>) + d = <fact1>28</fact1>

Combining the 'd' terms:

2d - <fact2>8</fact2> = <fact1>28</fact1>

Add <fact2>8</fact2> to both sides:

2d = <fact1>28</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2>
2d = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

d = 18

Therefore, Anna has 18 dimes.

He found <fact5>14 cans</fact5> on the <fact6>third day</fact6>. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you think Zachary will find on the <fact7>seventh day</fact7>?


**Answer:**

Observe the pattern:
- From <fact1>day 1</fact1> (<fact2>4 cans</fact2>) to <fact3>day 2</fact3> (<fact4>9 cans</fact4>), there is an increase of <fact4>9</fact4> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 5 cans.

Her sister has <fact2>double that amount</fact2>. They want to buy their mom a coat that costs <fact3>$80</fact3>. How much more money do they need?

**Answer:**

Maria has <fact1>$17</fact1>. Her sister has double that amount, meaning she has <fact1>$17</fact1> * <fact2>2</fact2> = $34.  Together they have <fact1>$17</fact1> + $34 = $51. The coat costs <fact3>$80</fact3>.  Therefore, they need <fact3>$80</fact3> - $51 = $29 more.  The answer is {29}.

She kept 12 for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?,"**Reformatted Question:** Tina had a large collection of beanie babies. She gave <fact1>8 beanie babies</fact1> to her cousin. She gave <fact2>half that amount</fact2> to her sister. She gave <fact3>36 beanie babies</fact3> to needy children. She kept <fact4>12</fact4> for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?

**Answer:**

Tina gave <fact2>half</fact2> of <fact1>8 beanie babies</fact1> to her sister, which is <fact1>8</fact1>/2 = 4 beanie babies.

In total, Tina gave away <fact1>8</fact1> + 4 + <fact3>36</fact3> = 48 beanie babies.

Since she kept <fact4>12</fact4> for herself, Tina's original collection had 48 + <fact4>12</fact4> = 60 beanie babies.

901,Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Mark had <fact1>24 marbles</fact1> and Evan had <fact2>3 marbles</fact2>. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly <fact3>double</fact3> the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?

Answer:
Let 'x' be the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan.

Mark initially had <fact1>24 marbles</fact1>. After giving 'x' marbles to Evan, Mark has 24 - x marbles.

Evan initially had <fact2>3 marbles</fact2>. After receiving 'x' marbles from Mark, Evan has 3 + x marbles.

According to the problem, Mark now has <fact3>double</fact3> the number of marbles Evan has.  So, we can set up the equation:

24 - x = 2 * (3 + x)

Solving for x:

24 - x = 6 + 2x
18 = 3x
x = 6

Therefore, Mark gave 6 marbles to Evan. The answer is {6}.

902,Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Annette and Caitlin weigh <fact1>95 pounds</fact1> together. Caitlin and Sara weigh <fact2>87 pounds</fact2> together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?

Answer:
Let 'a' represent Annette's weight, 'c' represent Caitlin's weight, and 's' represent Sara's weight.  We are given that a + c = <fact1>95</fact1> and c + s = <fact2>87</fact2>.  We want to find a - s.

We can express Caitlin's weight in terms of Annette's: c = <fact1>95</fact1> - a.
We can also express Caitlin's weight in terms of Sara's: c = <fact2>87</fact2> - s.

Since both expressions equal 'c', we can set them equal to each other: <fact1>95</fact1> - a = <fact2>87</fact2> - s.

Rearranging to solve for a - s:  a - s = <fact1>95</fact1> - <fact2>87</fact2> = 8.
Therefore, Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara. The answer is {8}.

904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"**Reformatted Question:** Three paper bags contain a total of <fact1>24</fact1> apples. The <fact2>first</fact2> and <fact3>second</fact3> bags contain a total of <fact4>11</fact4> apples. The <fact5>second</fact5> and <fact6>third</fact6> bags contain a total of <fact7>18</fact7> apples. How many apples are in the <fact2>first</fact2> and <fact6>third</fact6> bags together?

**Answer:**

Let's represent the number of apples in each bag as follows:

* **First bag:** F
* **Second bag:** S
* **Third bag:** T

We are given the following information:

1. **F + S + T = <fact1>24</fact1>**  (The total number of apples in all three bags)
2. **F + S = <fact4>11</fact4>** (The total number of apples in the first and second bags)
3. **S + T = <fact7>18</fact7>** (The total number of apples in the second and third bags)

We want to find the value of F + T.  We can do this by manipulating the given equations.

First, let's find the number of apples in the second bag (S).  We can do this by substituting the value of F + S from equation (2) into equation (1):

<fact4>11</fact4> + T = <fact1>24</fact1>
T = <fact1>24</fact1> - <fact4>11</fact4>
T = 13

Now, substitute the value of S + T from equation (3) into equation (1):

F + <fact7>18</fact7> = <fact1>24</fact1>
F = <fact1>24</fact1> - <fact7>18</fact7>
F = 6

Now that we know F = 6 and T = 13, we can find F + T:

F + T = 6 + 13 = 19

Therefore, the first and third bags together contain 19 apples.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{19}$
"
905,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

A worm has fallen into a hole that is <fact1>26 inches</fact1> deep. It climbs up <fact2>8 inches</fact2> and slides back <fact3>3 inches</fact3> every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?

Answer:
Each day, the worm makes a net progress of <fact2>8</fact2> - <fact3>3</fact3> = 5 inches.  After a certain number of days, the worm will be close enough to the top to reach it within a single upward climb of <fact2>8 inches</fact2>.  

To figure out how close the worm needs to be, we subtract <fact2>8</fact2> from <fact1>26</fact1>, giving us <fact1>26</fact1> - <fact2>8</fact2> = 18 inches.

Now we divide 18 by the worm's net progress per day to find how many days it takes to reach that point: 18 / 5 = 3.6 days.

Since the worm can't climb partial days, we round this up to 4 days.  Let's check the math:  4 days * 5 inches/day = 20 inches.  On the 4th day, the worm starts at the 20-inch mark, climbs <fact2>8 inches</fact2>, and reaches the top before it can slide back down <fact3>3 inches</fact3>.

So the answer is {4}.
"
906,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?","**Reformatted Question:** Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh <fact1>90 pounds</fact1> altogether. <fact2>Rita and Peter weigh the same amount</fact2>. <fact3>Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds</fact3> together. How much does Skeeter weigh?

**Answer:**

Since Rita and Peter weigh the same (<fact2>), and all three penguins weigh <fact1>90 pounds</fact1>, we can represent Rita and Peter's combined weight as 2 * Peter's weight.  Let's call Peter's weight 'x'. So, Rita and Peter together weigh 2x.

We know Peter and Skeeter together weigh <fact3>68 pounds</fact3>.  Therefore,  x + Skeeter's weight = 68.

We also know the total weight of all three is <fact1>90 pounds</fact1>: 2x + Skeeter's weight = 90.

Now we have two equations:

1. x + Skeeter's weight = 68
2. 2x + Skeeter's weight = 90

We can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate Skeeter's weight:

(2x + Skeeter's weight) - (x + Skeeter's weight) = 90 - 68

This simplifies to x = 22.  So, Peter weighs 22 pounds, and since Rita weighs the same as Peter (<fact2>), Rita also weighs 22 pounds.

Now, substitute Peter's weight (x = 22) back into equation 1:

22 + Skeeter's weight = 68

Skeeter's weight = 68 - 22 = 46 pounds.

Therefore, Skeeter weighs 46 pounds.

Answer:
Tim had <fact1>20 cards</fact1>. Ben had <fact3>twice</fact3> as many as Tim after buying <fact2>3 cards</fact2>, meaning Ben had 2 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 40 cards after buying the additional cards.

Megan and her sister, Tara, wanted to buy a scooter for <fact1>$26</fact1>. Tara had <fact2>$4 more</fact2> than Megan. Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did Tara have?

Answer:
Let's say Megan had $x.  Tara had <fact2>$4 more than Megan</fact2>, so Tara had $x + <fact2>$4</fact2>. Together, they had $x + (x + <fact2>4</fact2>) = <fact1>$26</fact1>. Simplifying this, we get 2x + <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact1>26</fact1>. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 22.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 11.  So Megan had $11.  Since Tara had <fact2>$4 more</fact2> than Megan, Tara had $11 + <fact2>$4</fact2> = $15.  The answer is {15}.

Rita is buying flower bulbs for her garden. She wants to buy the <fact1>same number</fact1> of <fact2>tulips</fact2> and <fact3>daffodils</fact3>. If <fact2>tulip bulbs</fact2> come in packs of <fact4>15</fact4> and <fact3>daffodil bulbs</fact3> come in packs of <fact5>16</fact5>, what is the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy?


**Answer:**

Since Rita wants to buy the <fact1>same number</fact1> of <fact2>tulips</fact2> and <fact3>daffodils</fact3>, she needs to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the pack sizes.  The pack sizes are <fact4>15</fact4> (for tulips) and <fact5>16</fact5> (for daffodils).

The prime factorization of 15 is 3 x 5.
The prime factorization of 16 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.

Since there are no common factors, the LCM is simply 15 * 16 = 240.

Therefore, Rita will need to buy 240 of each type of bulb.

Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of <fact1>18</fact1>, the seagulls traveled in flocks of <fact2>10</fact2>. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?

Answer:
We are looking for the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed, given that the number of ducks equals the number of seagulls. Ducks travel in flocks of <fact1>18</fact1>, and seagulls travel in flocks of <fact2>10</fact2>.  This means we are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 10.

The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3 * 3.
The prime factorization of 10 is 2 * 5.

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in the numbers: 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 = 90.

Since the ducks travel in flocks of <fact1>18</fact1>, Heather must have seen 90/<fact1>18</fact1> = 5 flocks of ducks.  This means she saw 5 * <fact1>18</fact1> = 90 ducks.

Similarly, since the seagulls travel in flocks of <fact2>10</fact2>, Heather must have seen 90/<fact2>10</fact2> = 9 flocks of seagulls. This means she saw 9 * <fact2>10</fact2> = 90 seagulls.

The smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed is 90. The answer is {90}.

                         Answer:
To find the greatest number of tables the planner can set up, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of adults (<fact1>12</fact1>) and the number of children (<fact2>20</fact2>).  This is because the GCD represents the largest number that divides both numbers evenly, ensuring <fact3>no people are left over</fact3> and that each table has the same combination of adults and children.

The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

The common factors of 12 and 20 are 1, 2, and 4.  The greatest of these is 4.

Therefore, the greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 4.  Each table would have 12/4 = 3 adults and 20/4 = 5 children.

Answer:
Since the shop sells bars of soap in boxes of <fact1>5</fact1> and bottles of soap in boxes of <fact2>19</fact2>, and they sold the same number of <fact3>bars and bottles</fact3>, the number of soaps sold must be a multiple of both <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>19</fact2>.

If this pattern continues, how many loaves of bread will they bake on Monday?


**Answer:**

Observing the pattern of loaves baked from Wednesday (<fact1>5</fact1>) to Thursday (<fact2>7</fact2>), there is an increase of <fact2>7</fact2> - <fact1>5</fact1> = 2 loaves.
From Thursday (<fact2>7</fact2>) to Friday (<fact3>10</fact3>), there is an increase of <fact3>10</fact3> - <fact2>7</fact2> = 3 loaves.
From Friday (<fact3>10</fact3>) to Saturday (<fact4>14</fact4>), there is an increase of <fact4>14</fact4> - <fact3>10</fact3> = 4 loaves.
From Saturday (<fact4>14</fact4>) to Sunday (<fact5>19</fact5>), there is an increase of <fact5>19</fact5> - <fact4>14</fact4> = 5 loaves.

The increase in loaves baked each day follows the pattern +2, +3, +4, +5.  If this pattern continues, the increase from Sunday (<fact5>19</fact5>) to Monday will be +6 loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves baked on Monday will be <fact5>19</fact5> + 6 = 25.

Sandra is sorting pencils into boxes. She put <fact1>78 pencils</fact1> in the <fact2>first box</fact2>, <fact3>87 pencils</fact3> in the <fact4>second box</fact4>, <fact5>96 pencils</fact5> in the <fact6>third box</fact6>, and <fact7>105 pencils</fact7> in the <fact8>fourth box</fact8>. If this pattern continues, how many pencils will Sandra put in the <fact9>fifth box</fact9>?


**Answer:**

Observe the pattern of pencils in each box:
* From <fact2>first</fact2> to <fact4>second</fact4> box: <fact3>87</fact3> - <fact1>78</fact1> = 9 more pencils
* From <fact4>second</fact4> to <fact6>third</fact6> box: <fact5>96</fact5> - <fact3>87</fact3> = 9 more pencils
* From <fact6>third</fact6> to <fact8>fourth</fact8> box: <fact7>105</fact7> - <fact5>96</fact5> = 9 more pencils

The pattern shows an increase of 9 pencils per box.  Therefore, the <fact9>fifth box</fact9> will contain <fact7>105</fact7> + 9 = 114 pencils.

The answer is {114}.

                    Answer:                         
We see a pattern here. From the information given, we observe that the number of books on each shelf is multiplied by 3 to get the number of books on the next shelf:
<fact2>First Shelf</fact2>: <fact1>2</fact1> books
<fact4>Second Shelf</fact4>: <fact1>2</fact1> * 3 = <fact3>6</fact3> books
<fact6>Third Shelf</fact6>: <fact3>6</fact3> * 3 = <fact5>18</fact5> books
<fact8>Fourth Shelf</fact8>: <fact5>18</fact5> * 3 = <fact7>54</fact7> books

If this pattern continues, the number of books on the fifth shelf will be <fact7>54</fact7> * 3 = 162 books.

Kayla got a new video game. She scored <fact1>2 points</fact1> on the <fact2>first level</fact2>, <fact3>3 points</fact3> on the <fact4>second level</fact4>, <fact5>5 points</fact5> on the <fact6>third level</fact6>, <fact7>8 points</fact7> on the <fact8>fourth level</fact8>, and <fact9>12 points</fact9> on the <fact10>fifth level</fact10>. If this pattern continues, how many points will Kayla score on the sixth level?

Answer:
Here's how to figure out Kayla's score on the sixth level:

* **Difference between levels:**
    * From <fact2>level 1</fact2> (<fact1>2 points</fact1>) to <fact4>level 2</fact4> (<fact3>3 points</fact3>): 3 - 2 = 1 point increase
    * From <fact4>level 2</fact4> (<fact3>3 points</fact3>) to <fact6>level 3</fact6> (<fact5>5 points</fact5>): 5 - 3 = 2 points increase
    * From <fact6>level 3</fact6> (<fact5>5 points</fact5>) to <fact8>level 4</fact8> (<fact7>8 points</fact7>): 8 - 5 = 3 points increase
    * From <fact8>level 4</fact8> (<fact7>8 points</fact7>) to <fact10>level 5</fact10> (<fact9>12 points</fact9>): 12 - 8 = 4 points increase

* **The Pattern:** The point increase between levels is increasing by 1 each time.

* **Predicting Level 6:**  Following the pattern, the increase from <fact10>level 5</fact10> to level 6 should be 5 points. Therefore, Kayla will score <fact9>12 points</fact9> + 5 points = 17 points on the sixth level.

If this pattern continues, how many flowers will Derek pick from the <fact11>sixth bush</fact11>?


**Answer:**

The pattern of flowers picked shows an increase of 4 flowers with each subsequent bush. From the <fact2>first bush</fact2> to the <fact4>second bush</fact4>, the increase is <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact1>18</fact1> = 4 flowers.  From the <fact4>second bush</fact4> to the <fact6>third bush</fact6>, the increase is <fact5>26</fact5> - <fact3>22</fact3> = 4 flowers. This pattern continues through to the <fact10>fifth bush</fact10>.

Since Derek picked <fact9>34 flowers</fact9> from the <fact10>fifth bush</fact10>, and the pattern increases by 4 flowers each bush, he will pick <fact9>34</fact9> + 4 = 38 flowers from the <fact11>sixth bush</fact11>.

If this pattern continues, how many hammers will the store order in October?


**Answer:**

The pattern of hammer orders is increasing. Let's look at the differences between consecutive months:

* From June (<fact1>3 hammers</fact1>) to July (<fact2>4 hammers</fact2>):  4 - 3 = 1 hammer increase
* From July (<fact2>4 hammers</fact2>) to August (<fact3>6 hammers</fact3>): 6 - 4 = 2 hammer increase
* From August (<fact3>6 hammers</fact3>) to September (<fact4>9 hammers</fact4>): 9 - 6 = 3 hammer increase

The increase in the number of hammers ordered each month is increasing by 1.  Following this pattern, the increase from September to October will be 4 hammers.

Therefore, the store will order <fact4>9</fact4> + 4 = 13 hammers in October.

The answer is {13}.

If this pattern continues, how many roses will the flower shop window display in February?


**Answer:**

The difference between the number of roses displayed in November (<fact2>120</fact2>) and October (<fact1>108</fact1>) is 120 - 108 = 12 roses.
The difference between the number of roses displayed in December (<fact3>132</fact3>) and November (<fact2>120</fact2>) is 132 - 120 = 12 roses.
The difference between the number of roses displayed in January (<fact4>144</fact4>) and December (<fact3>132</fact3>) is 144 - 132 = 12 roses.

Since the difference between each month is consistently 12 roses, we can assume this pattern continues. To find the number of roses displayed in February, we add 12 to the number displayed in January (<fact4>144</fact4>): 144 + 12 = 156.

Therefore, the flower shop window will display 156 roses in February.  The answer is {156}.

**Answer:**

The difference between the number of chairs in the <fact2>first</fact2> and <fact4>second</fact4> rows is <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact1>14</fact1> = 9 chairs.
The difference between the number of chairs in the <fact4>second</fact4> and <fact6>third</fact6> rows is <fact5>32</fact5> - <fact3>23</fact3> = 9 chairs.
The difference between the number of chairs in the <fact6>third</fact6> and <fact8>fourth</fact8> rows is <fact7>41</fact7> - <fact5>32</fact5> = 9 chairs.
The difference between the number of chairs in the <fact8>fourth</fact8> and <fact10>fifth</fact10> rows is <fact9>50</fact9> - <fact7>41</fact7> = 9 chairs.

1085,Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?,"**Reformatted Question:** Kira has <fact1>$1.20</fact1> in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?

**Answer:**

Let 'q' be the number of quarters and 'd' be the number of dimes.
We are given that Kira has a total of <fact1>$1.20</fact1>, which is equal to 120 cents.  The value of quarters is 25 cents and the value of dimes is 10 cents.  This gives us the equation:

25q + 10d = 120

We want to minimize the total number of coins (q + d). To do this, we should maximize the number of quarters since they have a higher value.

Let's try different values for 'q':

* If q = 4, then 25 * 4 + 10d = 120  =>  100 + 10d = 120  =>  10d = 20  => d = 2
    * Total coins: 4 + 2 = 6

* If q = 3, then 25 * 3 + 10d = 120  =>  75 + 10d = 120  =>  10d = 45  => d = 4.5  (Dimes must be whole numbers, so this isn't a valid solution)

* If q = 5, then 25 * 5 + 10d = 120 => 125 + 10d = 120. This leads to a negative number of dimes, which is not possible.

Therefore, the minimum number of coins Kira can have is 6 (4 quarters and 2 dimes).

The answer is {6}.

1087,"You have $12 in nickels and quarters. If you have the same number of each kind of coin, how many nickels do you have?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

You have <fact1>$12</fact1> in <fact2>nickels</fact2> and <fact3>quarters</fact3>. If you have the <fact4>same number of each kind of coin</fact4>, how many <fact2>nickels</fact2> do you have?

Let 'x' be the number of nickels and quarters.
A nickel is worth <fact2>$0.05</fact2> and a quarter is worth <fact3>$0.25</fact3>.
The total value of the coins is given by <fact1>$12</fact1>.
Since the number of nickels and quarters is the same (<fact4>x</fact4>), we have the equation:
0.05x + 0.25x = 12
0.30x = 12
x = 12 / 0.30
x = 40

So, you have 40 nickels.

The answer is {40}.

About how many blood cells were in the second sample?


The second sample contained <fact2>6,908 more blood cells than the first</fact2>, which had <fact1>1,410 blood cells</fact1>.  Therefore, the second sample contained 1,410 + 6,908 = 8,318 blood cells.

The question asks ""about"" how many, which implies an estimation is acceptable.  Since the question asks about the second sample and gives a precise number for the difference and the first sample's cell count, we calculate the exact amount (as opposed to rounding the initial numbers first).


The answer is {8318}.

**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out when Payton finishes her bike ride.  She starts at <fact2>3:27 p.m.</fact2> and rides for <fact1>85 minutes</fact1>. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, <fact1>85 minutes</fact1> is equal to 1 hour and 25 minutes (85 - 60 = 25). Adding 1 hour and 25 minutes to <fact2>3:27 p.m.</fact2> brings us to 4:52 p.m. (3:27 + 1:25 = 4:52).

Now, we know Payton finishes her ride at 4:52 p.m. and dinner is at <fact3>5:45 p.m.</fact3>  To find the time between these, we subtract the earlier time from the later time. From 4:52 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. is 8 minutes, and from 5:00 p.m. to <fact3>5:45 p.m.</fact3> is 45 minutes. Therefore, Payton will have 8 + 45 = 53 minutes between the end of her bike ride and dinner.

Cora sliced <fact1>18 kg</fact1> of green apples for a party. She divided the apple slices equally between <fact2>5</fact2> large bowls. How many grams of apple slices did Cora put in each bowl?

First, we calculate how many kilograms of apple slices Cora put in each bowl by dividing the total weight of apple slices by the number of bowls: <fact1>18 kg</fact1> / <fact2>5 bowls</fact2> = 3.6 kg/bowl.

Next, we convert kilograms to grams. Since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, we multiply the weight in kilograms by 1000: 3.6 kg/bowl * 1000 g/kg = 3600 g/bowl.

Therefore, Cora put 3600 grams of apple slices in each bowl.

Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up <fact1>one third of the container</fact1> with red paint. Then she filled the <fact2>remaining space</fact2> with <fact3>4 L</fact3> of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?

The question asks how many milliliters of paint were mixed in total.

Since <fact1>one third of the container</fact1> was filled with red paint, the <fact2>remaining space</fact2> represents two thirds of the container. This <fact2>remaining space</fact2> was filled with <fact3>4 L</fact3> of blue paint. Therefore, two thirds of the container equals <fact3>4 L</fact3>.

If two thirds of the container is <fact3>4 L</fact3>, then one third (the amount of red paint) must be <fact3>4 L</fact3> / 2 = 2 L.

The total amount of paint mixed is the sum of the red paint and the blue paint: 2 L + <fact3>4 L</fact3> = 6 L.

Finally, to convert liters to milliliters, we multiply by 1000: 6 L * 1000 mL/L = 6000 mL.


So the answer is {6000}.

**Answer:**
Let the marked price of the blouse be 'x'.
Since Rose bought the blouse at a discount of <fact1>18%</fact1>, she paid <fact2>100% - 18% = 82%</fact2> of the marked price.
So, 82% of x is equal to <fact2>$147.60</fact2>.
This can be written as the equation: 0.82x = <fact2>147.60</fact2>
To find the marked price (x), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.82:
x = <fact2>147.60</fact2> / 0.82
x = $180
Therefore, the marked price of the blouse was $180.  The answer is {180}.

1108,"Mila's father has 2 jobs. 1st job pays $375 more than the 2nd job. How much does he get from the 1st job if he gets per week a total of $3,875?","**Reformatted Question:** Mila's father has 2 jobs. The 1st job pays <fact1>$375 more</fact1> than the 2nd job. How much does he get from the <fact2>1st job</fact2> if he gets per week a total of <fact3>$3,875</fact3>?

**Answer:**

Let's say the amount Mila's father earns from his 2nd job is represented by 'x'.  Since the <fact2>1st job</fact2> pays <fact1>$375 more</fact1> than the 2nd job, the amount he earns from the <fact2>1st job</fact2> is 'x + $375'.

We know that his total weekly earnings are <fact3>$3,875</fact3>.  This is the sum of his earnings from both jobs.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + $375) = <fact3>$3,875</fact3>

Combining the 'x' terms:

2x + $375 = <fact3>$3,875</fact3>

Subtracting $375 from both sides of the equation:

2x = $3,500

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = $1,750

This means Mila's father earns $1,750 from his 2nd job. To find out how much he earns from his <fact2>1st job</fact2>, we add the <fact1>$375</fact1> difference:

$1,750 + <fact1>$375</fact1> = $2,125

Therefore, Mila's father earns $2,125 from his <fact2>1st job</fact2>.

The ratio of the number of <fact1>correct answers</fact1> to <fact2>incorrect answers</fact2> on Sam's math test is <fact3>7:3</fact3>. The <fact4>difference</fact4> between <fact1>correct</fact1> and <fact2>incorrect answers</fact2> is <fact5>20</fact5>. What was the <question>total number of questions</question> on the test?

Let 'c' represent the number of correct answers and 'i' represent the number of incorrect answers.

From the given information, we know that the ratio of correct to incorrect answers is <fact3>7:3</fact3>.  This can be written as:

c/i = <fact3>7/3</fact3>

We also know that the <fact4>difference</fact4> between the <fact1>correct</fact1> and <fact2>incorrect</fact2> answers is <fact5>20</fact5>:

c - i = <fact5>20</fact5>

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1) c/i = 7/3
2) c - i = 20

From equation (1), we can express 'c' in terms of 'i':

c = (7/3)i

Substitute this value of 'c' into equation (2):

(7/3)i - i = 20

(4/3)i = 20

i = 20 * (3/4)
i = 15

Now that we have the value of 'i', we can find the value of 'c':

c = (7/3) * 15
c = 35

The <question>total number of questions</question> is the sum of correct and incorrect answers:

Total = c + i
Total = 35 + 15
Total = 50

So, there were 50 questions on the test.

1112,The ratio of the weight of Meg's cat to the weight of Anne's cat is 5:7. Meg's cat weighs 20 kg. How much more does Anne's cat weigh?,"**Reformatted Question:**

The ratio of the weight of Meg's cat to the weight of Anne's cat is <fact1>5:7</fact1>. <fact2>Meg's cat weighs 20 kg</fact2>. How much more does <fact3>Anne's cat</fact3> weigh?


**Answer:**

Let M be the weight of Meg's cat and A be the weight of Anne's cat.  We are given that the ratio M:A is <fact1>5:7</fact1>.  This can be written as M/A = 5/7.

We are also given that <fact2>Meg's cat weighs 20 kg</fact2>, so M = 20. Substituting this into our ratio equation gives us 20/A = 5/7.

To solve for A (the weight of <fact3>Anne's cat</fact3>), we can cross-multiply: 5A = 20 * 7, which simplifies to 5A = 140. Dividing both sides by 5 gives A = 28 kg.

The question asks how much *more* <fact3>Anne's cat</fact3> weighs than Meg's cat.  Since Anne's cat weighs 28 kg and Meg's cat weighs 20 kg, the difference is 28 - 20 = 8 kg.

Therefore, Anne's cat weighs 8 kg more than Meg's cat. The answer is {8}.

How many more boys are there than girls?

**Answer:**

The ratio of boys to girls is <fact1>8:5</fact1>.  This means that for every 5 girls, there are 8 boys.

Since there are <fact2>30 girls</fact2>, we can determine how many ""sets"" of 5 girls are present: <fact2>30</fact2> / 5 = 6 sets.

For each of these 6 sets of girls, there are 8 boys. So, there are 6 * 8 = 48 boys.

Finally, to find how many more boys there are than girls, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys: 48 - <fact2>30</fact2> = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 more boys than girls. The answer is {18}.

Craig found <fact3>54 seashells</fact3>. How many fewer seashells did Brian find than Craig?

**Answer:**

Craig found <fact3>54 seashells</fact3>. Since for every <fact1>9 seashells</fact1> Craig found, Brian found <fact2>7</fact2>, we can determine how many sets of 9 shells Craig found by dividing the total number of shells Craig found by 9: <fact3>54</fact3>/<fact1>9</fact1> = 6.  This means Brian found 6 sets of <fact2>7 seashells</fact2>, which is 6 * <fact2>7</fact2> = 42 seashells.

1115,A recipe for fruit punch says to use 8 ounces of orange juice for every 3 ounces of grape juice. Nicky used 72 ounces of orange juice. How many fewer ounces of grape juice were used?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

A recipe for fruit punch says to use <fact1>8 ounces of orange juice</fact1> for every <fact2>3 ounces of grape juice</fact2>. Nicky used <fact3>72 ounces of orange juice</fact3>. How many fewer ounces of grape juice were used?

Answer:
The recipe calls for <fact1>8 ounces of orange juice</fact1> for every <fact2>3 ounces of grape juice</fact2>.  This is a ratio of 8:3.
Nicky used <fact3>72 ounces of orange juice</fact3>. To find out how much grape juice Nicky should have used, we set up a proportion:

8/3 = 72/x

Cross-multiply:

8x = 3 * 72
8x = 216
x = 216/8
x = 27

So Nicky should have used 27 ounces of grape juice. However, the question asks how many *fewer* ounces of grape juice were used. Since the problem doesn't state how much grape juice Nicky actually used, we can only determine how much he *should* have used (27 ounces), and not how many *fewer* ounces were used compared to a given amount.  If the question meant how much grape juice Nicky used compared to orange juice, the answer is 27 ounces of grape juice is used.  Then, the difference would be 72 - 27 = 45. Then Nicky used 45 fewer ounces of grape juice than orange juice.


If the question intends to ask ""How many fewer ounces of grape juice than orange juice did Nicky use?"", the answer is 45. But if the question means ""How many fewer ounces of grape juice did Nicky use than the recipe called for?"" then the question is incomplete because we don't know how much grape juice Nicky used.

First convert <fact1>12 kg</fact1> to grams.  Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, <fact1>12 kg</fact1> is equal to <fact1>12</fact1> * 1000 = 12000 g.

Noah started with 12000 g of trail mix and his family ate <fact2>8600 g</fact2>.  The amount of trail mix left is 12000 - <fact2>8600</fact2> = 3400 g.

The answer is {3400}.

If this pattern continues, how many berries will Malia pick from the fifth bush?

**Answer:**

Let's analyze the pattern of berries picked by Malia.

* From the first bush, she picks <fact1>3 berries</fact1>.
* From the second bush, she picks <fact2>4 berries</fact2>.
* From the third bush, she picks <fact3>7 berries</fact3>.
* From the fourth bush, she picks <fact4>12 berries</fact4>.

Each platter will have the same number of legs, thighs, and wings. How many platters can the staff make if they want the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

At Kentucky Fried Chicken, the kitchen staff baked <fact1>96 chicken legs</fact1>, <fact2>144 thighs</fact2>, and <fact3>224 wings</fact3>. The staff had to prepare platters for a catered lunch at an office. Each platter will have the same number of <fact4>legs</fact4>, <fact5>thighs</fact5>, and <fact6>wings</fact6>. How many platters can the staff make if they want the <fact7>greatest number</fact7> of chicken pieces on each platter?


We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of legs (<fact1>96</fact1>), thighs (<fact2>144</fact2>), and wings (<fact3>224</fact3>).  This will tell us the maximum number of platters that can be made, such that each platter has the same number of each chicken part.

First, find the prime factorization of each number:
96 = 2^5 * 3
144 = 2^4 * 3^2
224 = 2^5 * 7

The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.  The common prime factors are 2.  The lowest power of 2 is 2^4 = 16.

Therefore, the staff can make 16 platters.  Each platter will have 96/16 = <fact4>6 legs</fact4>, 144/16 = <fact5>9 thighs</fact5>, and 224/16 = <fact6>14 wings</fact6>, for a total of 6 + 9 + 14 = 29 pieces per platter.  Since 16 is the GCD, this is the <fact7>greatest</fact7> number of platters they can make with an equal number of each piece on each platter.


The answer is {16}.

1208,Jeremy has two pieces of wood: one is 90 inches and the other is 72 inches. He wants to cut both pieces of wood into smaller pieces so that all these pieces are the same length. How long does he cut the both pieces of wood?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Jeremy has two pieces of wood: one is <fact1>90 inches</fact1> and the other is <fact2>72 inches</fact2>. He wants to cut both pieces of wood into smaller pieces so that all these pieces are the <fact3>same length</fact3>. How long does he cut <fact4>both pieces of wood</fact4>?

**Answer:**

This question is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two lengths of wood, which are <fact1>90 inches</fact1> and <fact2>72 inches</fact2>. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.  Since we are looking for <fact3>the same length</fact3> for <fact4>both pieces</fact4>, finding the GCD will tell us the longest possible length each piece can be cut into.

The factors of 90 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90.
The factors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.

The common factors of 90 and 72 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The greatest of these is 18.

Therefore, Jeremy should cut both pieces of wood into pieces that are 18 inches long. This is the longest length possible that will divide evenly into both the <fact1>90-inch</fact1> and <fact2>72-inch</fact2> pieces of wood, satisfying the requirement that all pieces are the <fact3>same length</fact3>.

If <constraint>he wants each serving to be identical, with no food left over</constraint>, what is <question>the greatest number of servings Abraham can create</question>?


**Answer:**

To maximize the number of servings while ensuring each serving is identical and no food is left over, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of carrot sticks (<fact1>9</fact1>) and celery sticks (<fact2>18</fact2>).  The factors of <fact1>9</fact1> are 1, 3, and 9. The factors of <fact2>18</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.  The greatest common factor of <fact1>9</fact1> and <fact2>18</fact2> is 9.

Kiara baked <fact1>30 oatmeal cookies</fact1> and <fact2>48 chocolate chip cookies</fact2> to package in plastic containers for her teacher friends at school. She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?

Answer:
We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oatmeal cookies (<fact1>30</fact1>) and the number of chocolate chip cookies (<fact2>48</fact2>).  The GCD represents the largest number of each type of cookie that can be placed in each container.

The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.
The factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48.

The common factors of 30 and 48 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest common factor is 6.

So, each container will have 6 cookies of each kind.  Since there are <fact1>30 oatmeal cookies</fact1>, there will be 30/6 = 5 containers of oatmeal cookies. Since there are <fact2>48 chocolate chip cookies</fact2>, there will be 48/6 = 8 containers of chocolate chip cookies.

Since she wants to create identical containers with the same number of each type of cookie, she will need to make as many identical containers as possible. Each container has 6 oatmeal cookies and 6 chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, she will need the smaller number of possible containers which is 5 containers for the oatmeal cookies. Using 5 containers, she will pack 5 * 6 = 30 oatmeal cookies and 5 * 6 = 30 chocolate chip cookies. There will be leftover chocolate chip cookies since 48 - 30 = 18. These can be packed into 18/6=3 more containers.
In total, she needs 5 + 3 = 8 containers.

The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.
The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

The common factors of 32, 24, and 16 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.  Since we are looking for the <fact5>greatest number of arrangements</fact5>, we want the greatest common divisor, which is 8.

Karen is packing equal quantities of pretzels and crackers. This means the number of pretzels and crackers must be the same.
Pretzels are bagged in groups of <fact1>5</fact1>, and crackers are bagged in groups of <fact2>7</fact2>.  We are looking for the smallest number of each that are equal. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>7</fact2>.
Since <fact1>5</fact1> and <fact2>7</fact2> are both prime numbers, their least common multiple is simply their product.
LCM(<fact1>5</fact1>, <fact2>7</fact2>) = <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact2>7</fact2> = 35.
Therefore, the smallest number of crackers Karen can pack is 35.

The answer is {35}.

1228,"Irene's Bakery sells muffins in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5. Going through yesterday's receipts, a store manager notices that the bakery sold the same number of muffins and cookies yesterday afternoon. What is the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold?","**Reformatted Question:**

Irene's Bakery sells muffins in packages of <fact1>18</fact1> and cookies in packages of <fact2>5</fact2>. Going through yesterday's receipts, a store manager notices that the bakery sold the same number of <fact3>muffins</fact3> and <fact3>cookies</fact3> yesterday afternoon. What is the smallest number of <fact3>muffins</fact3> that the bakery could have sold?

**Answer:**

The question states that the bakery sold the same number of <fact3>muffins</fact3> and <fact3>cookies</fact3>.  Since muffins are sold in packages of <fact1>18</fact1> and cookies are sold in packages of <fact2>5</fact2>, the number of each sold must be a multiple of both 18 and 5. We are looking for the smallest number of <fact3>muffins</fact3>, so we are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>18</fact1> and <fact2>5</fact2>.

The prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3.
The prime factorization of 5 is 5.

Since there are no common factors, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers: 18 x 5 = 90.

Therefore, the smallest number of <fact3>muffins</fact3> the bakery could have sold is 90.  The answer is {90}.

What is the smallest number of students each can have?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Zack tutors students in groups of <fact1>14</fact1>. Meanwhile, Karen tutors students in groups of <fact2>10</fact2>. While discussing their work, the tutors realize that they both work with the same total number of students. What is the smallest number of students each can have?

Answer:
We are looking for the smallest number of students that is a multiple of both <fact1>14</fact1> and <fact2>10</fact2>. This is known as the least common multiple (LCM).

We can find the LCM by finding the prime factorization of each number:
<fact1>14</fact1> = 2 * 7
<fact2>10</fact2> = 2 * 5

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization and multiplying them together:
LCM(<fact1>14</fact1>, <fact2>10</fact2>) = 2 * 5 * 7 = 70

Therefore, the smallest number of students each tutor can have is 70.  The answer is {70}.

Across town, Rachel's Blooms sells roses in groups of <fact2>19</fact2>. If a customer wants to buy the same number of roses from both vendors, what is the smallest number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor?

**Answer:**  Since Martha's Blossoms sells roses in groups of <fact1>9</fact1> and Rachel's Blooms sells roses in groups of <fact2>19</fact2>, the customer needs to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 19. Because 9 and 19 are relatively prime (they share no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product: <fact1>9</fact1> * <fact2>19</fact2> = 171. Therefore, the smallest number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor is 171.

Andy is buying AA batteries and D batteries. The store sells AA batteries in packs of <fact1>38</fact1> and D batteries in packs of <fact2>44</fact2>. If Andy wishes to buy the same number of AA and D batteries, what is the smallest number of each battery type that he can buy?

                         Answer:
We are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>38</fact1> and <fact2>44</fact2>.

First, find the prime factorization of each number:
<fact1>38</fact1> = 2 x 19
<fact2>44</fact2> = 2 x 2 x 11 = 2^2 x 11

The LCM is found by multiplying the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization:
LCM(38, 44) = 2^2 x 11 x 19 = 4 x 11 x 19 = 836

Therefore, the smallest number of each battery type that Andy can buy is 836. The answer is {836}.

A coat factory had <fact1>29 coats</fact1>. If they wanted to put them into <fact2>3 boxes</fact2>, with the same number of coats in each box, how many extra coats would they have left over?

                    Answer:
We are given that there are <fact1>29 coats</fact1> and they want to divide these coats equally into <fact2>3 boxes</fact2>.

Dividing 29 by 3, we have 29 ÷ 3 = 9 with a remainder of 2.

1293,Miguel is 46 years old. He is 4 years older than thrice his son's age. Find the age of his son.,"**Reformatted Question:** Miguel is <fact1>46 years old</fact1>. He is <fact2>4 years older than thrice his son's age</fact2>. Find the age of his son.

**Answer:**

Let Miguel's son's age be *x* years.
According to the problem, Miguel is <fact2>thrice his son's age plus 4 years old</fact2>.  This can be written as:

3*x + 4 = Miguel's age

We know that Miguel is <fact1>46 years old</fact1>. So,

3*x + 4 = <fact1>46</fact1>

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

3*x = <fact1>46</fact1> - 4
3*x = 42

Dividing both sides by 3, we find the son's age:

x = 42 / 3
x = 14

Therefore, Miguel's son is 14 years old. The answer is {14}.

1294,"Pete, Bryan and Philip are cousins. Pete's age is one-third of Bryan and Philip is five years elder than Bryan. If the sum of the age of the cousins is 40, find the ages of each.","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Pete, Bryan and Philip are cousins. <fact1>Pete's age is one-third of Bryan</fact1> and <fact2>Philip is five years elder than Bryan</fact2>. <fact3>If the sum of the age of the cousins is 40</fact3>, find the ages of each.


Let's denote Pete's age as P, Bryan's age as B, and Philip's age as H.
From <fact1>""Pete's age is one-third of Bryan""</fact1>, we can write the equation:
P = B/3

From <fact2>""Philip is five years elder than Bryan""</fact2>, we can write the equation:
H = B + 5

From <fact3>""If the sum of the age of the cousins is 40""</fact3>, we have:
P + B + H = 40

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
(B/3) + B + (B + 5) = 40

Now we solve for B:
B/3 + B + B + 5 = 40
B/3 + 2B = 35
Multiplying the entire equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
B + 6B = 105
7B = 105
B = 105 / 7
B = 15

Now that we know Bryan's age (B = 15), we can find Pete's age using P = B/3:
P = 15 / 3
P = 5

And we can find Philip's age using H = B + 5:
H = 15 + 5
H = 20

Therefore, Pete is 5 years old, Bryan is 15 years old, and Philip is 20 years old.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Pete=5, Bryan=15, Philip=20}$

1295,Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.,"**Reformatted Question:** Ana is <fact1>5 years more than</fact1> Jack. The <fact2>sum of their ages</fact2> is <fact3>29</fact3>. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.

**Answer:**

Let Jack's age be represented by 'x'.
<fact1>Ana is 5 years older than Jack</fact1>, so Ana's age is x + 5.
The <fact2>sum of their ages is 29</fact2>, so x + (x + 5) = <fact3>29</fact3>.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 5 = 29.
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives 2x = 24.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 12. So, Jack is 12 years old.
Ana's age is x + 5, so Ana is 12 + 5 = 17 years old.

Therefore, Jack is 12 and Ana is 17.

1296,Tina is 3 years younger than Tom. The ages are in the ratio 2:3. Find their ages.,"**Reformatted Question:** Tina is <fact1>3 years younger</fact1> than Tom. The <fact2>ages</fact2> are in the ratio <fact3>2:3</fact3>. Find their <fact2>ages</fact2>.

**Answer:**

Let Tina's age be 2x and Tom's age be 3x (due to the given ratio <fact3>2:3</fact3>).
According to the problem, Tina is <fact1>3 years younger</fact1> than Tom. This translates to the equation:

3x - 2x = 3

Solving for x:

x = 3

Therefore, Tina's age is 2 * 3 = 6 years, and Tom's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.  So, Tina is 6 and Tom is 9. This satisfies the condition that Tina is <fact1>3 years younger</fact1> than Tom (9 - 6 = 3) and their <fact2>ages</fact2> are in the ratio <fact3>2:3</fact3> (6/9 simplifies to 2/3).

The answer is Tina is 6 years old and Tom is 9 years old.

The <fact3>sum of their ages is 60</fact3>. Find the ages of George, Christopher and Ford.


**Answer:**

Let's represent Christopher's age as 'x'.

*  <fact1>George's age:</fact1> Since George is <fact1>8 years older</fact1> than Christopher, his age is x + 8.
*  <fact2>Ford's age:</fact2> Since Ford is <fact2>2 years younger</fact2> than Christopher, his age is x - 2.

The <fact3>sum of their ages</fact3> is <fact3>60</fact3>. Therefore, we can write an equation:

(x + 8) + x + (x - 2) = 60

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 6 = 60
3x = 54
x = 18

So, Christopher is 18 years old.

Now we can find the ages of George and Ford:

* George: x + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26 years old
* Ford: x - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16 years old

Therefore, George is 26, Christopher is 18, and Ford is 16.

Let S be Steven's age.
<fact1>Devon's age</fact1> is 12.
<fact3>Half of Steven's age</fact3> is S/2.
<fact2>2 more than half of Steven's age</fact2> is S/2 + 2.

According to the problem, <fact1>Devon's age</fact1> is equal to <fact2>2 more than half of Steven's age</fact2>.
Therefore, we have the equation:
12 = S/2 + 2

Subtract 2 from both sides:
12 - 2 = S/2
10 = S/2

Multiply both sides by 2:
10 * 2 = S
20 = S

So, <fact4>Steven</fact4> is 20 years old.
The answer is {20}.

The sum of their ages is <fact3>11</fact3>. Find the age of the brothers.

**Answer:**

Since Nick and Kane were born on the same date <fact1>in consecutive years</fact1>, their ages differ by 1 year.  Because <fact2>Nick is younger</fact2>, Kane is 1 year older than Nick.

Let Nick's age be 'x'. Then Kane's age is 'x + 1'.

The sum of their ages is <fact3>11</fact3>. So, x + (x + 1) = 11.

This simplifies to 2x + 1 = 11.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives 2x = 10.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 5.

Therefore, Nick is 5 years old and Kane is 5 + 1 = 6 years old.

Nick's age is 5 and Kane's age is 6.

**Answer:**

Let Ashley's age be represented by 4x and Mary's age by 7x, based on the given ratio of <fact1>4:7</fact1>.  The problem states that the sum of their ages is <fact2>22</fact2>.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4x + 7x = <fact2>22</fact2>

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = <fact2>22</fact2>

Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we find the value of x:

x = <fact2>22</fact2> / 11 = 2

Now we can substitute x = 2 back into the expressions for their ages:

Ashley's age: 4 * 2 = 8
Mary's age: 7 * 2 = 14

Therefore, Ashley is 8 years old and Mary is 14 years old.

1304,"The ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. Find the ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack.","**Reformatted Question:** The ages of <fact1>Peter</fact1>, <fact2>Margaret</fact2> and <fact3>Jack</fact3> are <fact4>consecutive odd numbers</fact4>. <fact5>The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years</fact5>. Find the ages of <fact1>Peter</fact1>, <fact2>Margaret</fact2> and <fact3>Jack</fact3>.


**Answer:**

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Margaret's age as M, and Jack's age as J.

Since their ages are <fact4>consecutive odd numbers</fact4>, we can express them as:
* P = x
* M = x + 2
* J = x + 4

where x is an odd number.

According to <fact5>the problem</fact5>, the sum of Peter's and Margaret's ages equals Jack's age 5 years ago.  This can be written as:

P + M = J - 5

Substituting the expressions for P, M, and J from above:

x + (x + 2) = (x + 4) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 2 = x - 1

x = -3

However, age cannot be negative. This implies there is an issue with the assumption that Peter is the youngest. Let's assume Jack is the youngest:

* J = x
* M = x + 2
* P = x + 4

Now, the equation becomes:

(x+2) + (x+4) = x - 5
2x + 6 = x - 5
x = -11

Again, age cannot be negative. Let’s try Margaret is the youngest:


* M = x
* P = x+2
* J = x+4

Now the equation becomes:
x + (x+2) = (x+4) – 5
2x+2 = x - 1
x = -3
Again, the age is negative which means it can not be correct.



Let's reconsider the initial assumption where Peter is youngest and revisit the equation:  P + M = J - 5. Since we are dealing with consecutive *odd* numbers, it's helpful to explicitly represent them using an odd number base. Let's say Peter's age is 2n+1 (where n is an integer). Then:

* P = 2n + 1
* M = 2n + 3
* J = 2n + 5

Substituting into the equation:

(2n + 1) + (2n + 3) = (2n + 5) - 5

4n + 4 = 2n

2n = -4
n = -2

So,
P = 2(-2) + 1 = -3
M = 2(-2) + 3 = -1
J = 2(-2) + 5 = 1


Since ages cannot be negative, there appears to be a contradiction in the problem statement itself. If the ages are consecutive odd numbers and the sum of two of them is equal to the third minus 5, there’s no solution with positive ages.

1305,"The sum of the ages of Tony and Teddy equals their mother's age. Tony is two years younger than Teddy. If the age of the mother is 42, find the ages of Tony and Teddy?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

The sum of the ages of <fact1>Tony</fact1> and <fact2>Teddy</fact2> equals their <fact3>mother's age</fact3>. <fact1>Tony</fact1> is <fact4>two years younger</fact4> than <fact2>Teddy</fact2>. If the age of the <fact3>mother is 42</fact3>, find the ages of <fact1>Tony</fact1> and <fact2>Teddy</fact2>?

Let's say Teddy's age is 'x'.
Since Tony is <fact4>two years younger</fact4> than Teddy, Tony's age is 'x - 2'.
The question says that the sum of Tony's and Teddy's ages equals their <fact3>mother's age</fact3>. So, (x - 2) + x = <fact3>42</fact3>.
Simplifying the equation: 2x - 2 = 42.
Adding 2 to both sides: 2x = 44.
Dividing both sides by 2: x = 22.
So, Teddy's age is 22 years.
Tony's age is x - 2 = 22 - 2 = 20 years.

Therefore, Tony is 20 years old, and Teddy is 22 years old.  {20, 22}

At present <fact1>Allen is 10 years younger than Scott</fact1>. <fact2>Five years from now</fact2>, <fact3>Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen</fact3>. Find the present age of Allen and Scott.


**Answer:**

Let 'x' represent Allen's current age.
<fact1>Since Allen is 10 years younger than Scott</fact1>, Scott's current age can be represented as x + 10.

<fact2>Five years from now</fact2>, Scott's age will be x + 10 + 5 = x + 15.
<fact3>At that time, Scott's age will be twice Allen's present age</fact3>, which is 2x.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 15 = 2x

Solving for x:
x + 15 = 2x
15 = x

So, Allen's present age is 15 years old.
Since Scott is 10 years older than Allen, Scott's present age is 15 + 10 = 25 years old.


Therefore, Allen is 15 years old and Scott is 25 years old.

1307,"The present ages of Lewis and Brown are in the ratio 1:2. Three years from now, the ages will be in the ratio 3:5. Find the present ages of Lewis and Brown.","**Reformatted Question:** The present ages of <fact1>Lewis</fact1> and <fact2>Brown</fact2> are in the ratio <fact3>1:2</fact3>. <fact4>Three years from now</fact4>, the ages will be in the ratio <fact5>3:5</fact5>. Find the present ages of <fact1>Lewis</fact1> and <fact2>Brown</fact2>.

**Answer:**

Let L be Lewis's present age and B be Brown's present age.

From the first part of the question, we know that the ratio of Lewis's age to Brown's age is <fact3>1:2</fact3>. We can express this as:

L/B = <fact3>1/2</fact3> 
which simplifies to
2L = B

<fact4>Three years from now</fact4>, Lewis's age will be L + 3 and Brown's age will be B + 3.  The problem tells us the ratio of their ages at that time will be <fact5>3:5</fact5>.  We can express this as:

(L + 3)/(B + 3) = <fact5>3/5</fact5>

Cross-multiplying gives us:

5(L + 3) = 3(B + 3)
5L + 15 = 3B + 9

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) 2L = B
2) 5L + 15 = 3B + 9

Substitute the first equation (B = 2L) into the second equation:

5L + 15 = 3(2L) + 9
5L + 15 = 6L + 9
15 - 9 = 6L - 5L
6 = L

Now that we know Lewis's present age (L=6), we can find Brown's present age using the first equation:

B = 2L
B = 2 * 6
B = 12

Therefore, Lewis's present age is 6 and Brown's present age is 12.

**Answer:**

Let the number be represented by *x*.

""Thrice the sum of a number <fact1>and 2</fact1>"" can be written algebraically as 3 * (x + 2).

""24 <fact2>added with</fact2> the same number""  can be written algebraically as 24 + x.

The question states that these two expressions are equal, so the equation is:

3 * (x + 2) = 24 + x

Now we solve for x:

3x + 6 = 24 + x       (Distribute the 3)
3x - x = 24 - 6         (Subtract x and 6 from both sides)
2x = 18                   (Combine like terms)
x = 18 / 2                (Divide both sides by 2)

**Answer:**

Let the number be represented by the variable 'x'.

The phrase ""thrice a number"" means three times the number, which can be written algebraically as 3x.

The question states that ""A number added with thrice a number is <fact1>20</fact1>"". This translates to the equation: x + 3x = <fact1>20</fact1>.

Combining like terms, we have 4x = <fact1>20</fact1>.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = <fact1>20</fact1>/4

Therefore, x = 5.

The number is 5.

**Answer:**

There are two possibilities since we only know the difference between the numbers.

1. **Case 1: 91 is the smaller number.**  If <fact2>91</fact2> is the smaller number, then the other number is larger. Since the <fact1>difference is 100</fact1>, the larger number is <fact2>91</fact2> + <fact1>100</fact1> = 191.

2. **Case 2: 91 is the larger number.** If <fact2>91</fact2> is the larger number, then the other number is smaller.  Since the <fact1>difference is 100</fact1>, the smaller number is <fact2>91</fact2> - <fact1>100</fact1> = -9.

Therefore, the other number could be either 191 or -9.

(1/3) * *x* - 7 = 8  (This represents ""One-third of <fact1>a number</fact1> <fact2>minus seven</fact2> gives <fact3>eight</fact3>."")

To solve for *x*, we first add 7 to both sides of the equation:

(1/3) * *x* = 8 + 7
(1/3) * *x* = 15

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to isolate *x*:

*x* = 15 * 3
*x* = 45

Therefore, <fact1>the number</fact1> is 45.

**Answer:** Let the unknown number be represented by *x*. According to the problem, two-thirds of <fact1>the number</fact1> (*x*) can be written as (2/3)*x*.  Adding <fact2>six</fact2> to this results in (2/3)*x* + <fact2>6</fact2>.  The problem states this sum is equal to <fact3>ten</fact3>.  So, we can write the equation:

(2/3)*x* + 6 = 10

Subtract <fact2>6</fact2> from both sides of the equation:

(2/3)*x* = 10 - 6
(2/3)*x* = 4

The sum of three <fact1>consecutive even numbers</fact1> is <fact2>42</fact2>. Choose a suitable variable and create single-variable algebraic equations and find the <fact3>difference between the greatest and smallest number</fact3>.

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the smallest even number.
Since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, the next two even numbers will be x + 2 and x + 4.

According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is <fact2>42</fact2>.  We can express this as an equation:
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 42

Simplifying the equation:
3x + 6 = 42
3x = 42 - 6
3x = 36
x = 36 / 3
x = 12

So, the three consecutive even numbers are 12, 14 (12+2), and 16 (12+4).

We are asked to find the <fact3>difference between the greatest and smallest number</fact3>. The greatest number is 16 and the smallest is 12.  The difference is:

1323,One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.,"**Reformatted Question:** One-third of <fact1>a certain number</fact1> added with one-fifth gives <fact2>eight-fifteenth</fact2> of <fact1>the number</fact1>. Find <fact1>the number</fact1> and check your calculation.


**Answer:** Let the number be x.
According to the question, one-third of the number (x) can be represented as (1/3)x.  One-fifth can be represented as the fraction 1/5. Eight-fifteenths of the number can be represented as (8/15)x.

The problem states that (1/3)x added to 1/5 results in (8/15)x. This can be written as an equation:

(1/3)x + (1/5) = (8/15)x

To solve for x, we first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 3, 5, and 15 is 15.  So we rewrite the equation with 15 as the denominator:

(5/15)x + (3/15) = (8/15)x

Now we can subtract (5/15)x from both sides of the equation:

(3/15) = (3/15)x

Dividing both sides by (3/15) gives us:

x = 1

Now, let's check our calculation. Substitute x = 1 back into the original equation:

(1/3)(1) + (1/5) = (8/15)(1)
(1/3) + (1/5) = (8/15)

Using 15 as the common denominator:

(5/15) + (3/15) = (8/15)
(8/15) = (8/15)

The left side equals the right side, so our calculation is correct.

Therefore, the number is 1.

10 = <fact1>6</fact1> + w
Subtracting <fact1>6</fact1> from both sides:
w = 10 - <fact1>6</fact1>
w = 4
Therefore, the width of the cupboard is 4 m. The answer is {4}.

Find the <question>sides of the triangle</question>.


**Answer:**

Let the sides of the triangle be 2x, 4x, and 3x.  We know from <fact1>the definition of a scalene triangle</fact1> that all sides have different lengths, and the ratio <fact2>2:4:3</fact2> confirms this. The <fact3>perimeter of a triangle</fact3> is the sum of its sides.  Therefore, according to the problem, we have:

2x + 4x + 3x = <fact4>27</fact4>

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

9x = 27

Dividing both sides by 9 gives:

x = 3

Now we can find the length of each side by substituting x = 3 back into our expressions for the sides:

* Side 1: 2 * 3 = 6 inches
* Side 2: 4 * 3 = 12 inches
* Side 3: 3 * 3 = 9 inches

Therefore, the sides of the triangle are 6 inches, 12 inches, and 9 inches.

The parallel sides (bases) are in the ratio <fact3>2:5</fact3>. Find the length of the bases.

**Answer:**

Let the lengths of the parallel sides (bases) be 2x and 5x.  We know that the area of a trapezium is given by the formula:

Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height

We are given that the area is <fact1>84 sq.cm</fact1> and the height is <fact2>8 cm</fact2>.  Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

<fact1>84</fact1> = (1/2) * (2x + 5x) * <fact2>8</fact2>

Simplifying the equation:

84 = (1/2) * 7x * 8
84 = 28x
x = 84 / 28
x = 3

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the lengths of the parallel sides.

Length of the first parallel side = 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 cm
Length of the second parallel side = 5x = 5 * 3 = 15 cm

Therefore, the lengths of the bases are 6 cm and 15 cm.

The length of the hall is <fact2>32 yards</fact2>. Find the required width of the carpet.

**Answer:**

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width.  We are given that the area of the hall (and thus the carpet) is <fact1>800 sq. yards</fact1> and the length is <fact2>32 yards</fact2>.  Let the width be represented by 'w'.

So, Area = Length * Width

<fact1>800</fact1> = <fact2>32</fact2> * w

To find the width (w), we divide the area by the length:

w = <fact1>800</fact1> / <fact2>32</fact2>

w = 25 yards

Therefore, the required width of the carpet is 25 yards. The answer is {25}.

**Answer:**

The area of a <fact1>right-angled triangle</fact1> is given by the formula:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

We are given that the area is <fact2>32 sq. cm</fact2> and the <fact3>base</fact3> is <fact4>8 cm</fact4>.  We need to find the <fact5>height</fact5>. Let's represent the height with the variable 'h'.

Simplifying the equation:

32 = 4 * h

To isolate 'h', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

h = 32 / 4

h = 8

Therefore, the <fact5>height</fact5> of the triangle is 8 cm.

The length of the rectangular building is <fact1>7 ft more than its width</fact1>. If the <fact2>perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft</fact2>, find its length and width.


**Answer:**

Let's represent the width of the building as 'w'. According to the problem, the length is <fact1>7 ft more than the width</fact1>, so the length can be represented as 'w + 7'.

The <fact2>perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(length + width)</fact2>.  We are given that the <fact2>perimeter is 98 ft</fact2>.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2(w + (w + 7)) = <fact2>98</fact2>

Simplifying the equation:

2(2w + 7) = 98
4w + 14 = 98
4w = 98 - 14
4w = 84
w = 84 / 4
w = 21

So, the width of the building is 21 ft.  Since the length is <fact1>7 ft more than the width</fact1>, the length is 21 + <fact1>7</fact1> = 28 ft.

Therefore, the length of the building is 28 ft and the width is 21 ft.

In an isosceles triangle <relevant>one of the angles</relevant> of a <relevant>triangle</relevant> is <relevant>54 degrees</relevant>. <relevant>Find the base angles</relevant> of the <relevant>triangle</relevant>.


                    Answer:
There are two possible scenarios:

1. **54 degrees is one of the base angles:**  Since it's an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are equal. Therefore, if one base angle is <relevant>54 degrees</relevant>, the other base angle is also 54 degrees.

2. **54 degrees is the vertex angle (the angle not equal to the base angles):** The sum of angles in a <relevant>triangle</relevant> is 180 degrees. If the vertex angle is <relevant>54 degrees</relevant>, then the sum of the two base angles is 180 - 54 = 126 degrees. Since the base angles are equal in an isosceles <relevant>triangle</relevant>, each base angle is 126 / 2 = 63 degrees.

Therefore, the base angles are either both 54 degrees or both 63 degrees.

Let the angles of the triangle be <fact1>1x</fact1>, <fact1>2x</fact1>, and <fact1>3x</fact1>.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
So, <fact1>1x</fact1> + <fact1>2x</fact1> + <fact1>3x</fact1> = 180
6x = 180
x = 180/6
x = 30

<fact1>2x</fact1> = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
<fact1>3x</fact1> = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The angles of the triangle are 30, 60, and 90 degrees.

**Answer:**

Let's denote the first angle as 'x'.

According to the problem, the <fact1>second angle</fact1> is ""<fact2>32 degree less than thrice the first angle</fact2>"".  This can be written as:
Second angle = 3x - 32

The problem also states that the <fact3>third angle</fact3> is ""<fact4>28 degree less than twice the first angle</fact4>"". This can be written as:
Third angle = 2x - 28

We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + (3x - 32) + (2x - 28) = 180

Combining like terms:
6x - 60 = 180

Adding 60 to both sides:
6x = 240

Dividing both sides by 6:
x = 40

Now that we know the first angle (x = 40), we can find the other two angles:

Second angle = 3 * 40 - 32 = 120 - 32 = 88 degrees
Third angle = 2 * 40 - 28 = 80 - 28 = 52 degrees

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 40 degrees, 88 degrees, and 52 degrees.

Find the perimeter of the field.,"**Reformatted Question:** A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where <fact1>width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same</fact1>. The <fact2>length of rectangular region</fact2> is <fact3>76 ft</fact3> and the <fact4>side of triangular region</fact4> measures <fact5>42 ft</fact5>. Find the perimeter of the field.

**Answer:**

The perimeter of the field is the sum of the lengths of all its external sides.  Let's break it down:

* **Rectangle:** The <fact2>length</fact2> of the rectangular part of the field is given as <fact3>76 ft</fact3>. Since it's a rectangle, there are two lengths. This contributes 2 * <fact3>76 ft</fact3> = 152 ft to the total perimeter.
* **Rectangle Width/Triangle Side:** The <fact1>width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the triangle</fact1>, and we are told the <fact4>triangle's side</fact4> is <fact5>42 ft</fact5>.  This means the width of the rectangle is also <fact5>42 ft</fact5>. Only one of the rectangle's widths contributes to the field's perimeter since the other is attached to the triangle. This adds <fact5>42 ft</fact5> to the perimeter.
* **Triangle:** The triangle is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal. Since one <fact4>side</fact4> is <fact5>42 ft</fact5>, the other two sides are also <fact5>42 ft</fact5> each. These two sides contribute 2 * <fact5>42 ft</fact5> = 84 ft to the perimeter.

Summing these contributions gives us 152 ft + <fact5>42 ft</fact5> + 84 ft = 278 ft.

Therefore, the perimeter of the field is 278 ft.

That was <fact2>3/4</fact2> of your notecards that you need to turn in. How many notecards had you completed?                         Answer:

Let 'x' be the total number of notecards you completed.  The problem states that your dog ate <fact1>12</fact1> notecards, and this represents <fact2>3/4</fact2> of the total notecards.  We can set up the equation:

(3/4) * x = <fact1>12</fact1>

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = <fact1>12</fact1> * (4/3)
x = 16

Therefore, you had completed 16 notecards. The answer is {16}.

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the number of comic books Benny started with.

He sold half of his comic books, which means he had x * <fact1>1/2</fact1> = x/2 comic books left.

Then he bought <fact2>6 more</fact2> comic books. So, he had x/2 + <fact2>6</fact2> comic books.

Now, he has <fact3>17</fact3> comic books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 6 = <fact3>17</fact3>

Subtract 6 from both sides:

x/2 = 11

Multiply both sides by 2:

x = 22

So, Benny began with 22 comic books. The answer is {22}.

Answer:
Fred has <fact3>26 cards</fact3> left after his dog ate half of his collection. This means that 26 cards represents half of his collection before the incident.  To find the full size of the collection before the dog ate half of it, we multiply the remaining cards by two: <fact3>26</fact3> * 2 = 52 cards.

Since Fred had 52 cards right before his dog ate some, and this was *after* he added the <fact1>5 new cards</fact1>, it means he originally had 52 - <fact1>5</fact1> = 47 cards.
Therefore, Fred started with 47 cards.

1388,The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is one hundred twenty-three. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?,"**Reformatted Question:** The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is <fact1>one hundred twenty-three</fact1>. What is the smallest of the three numbers?

**Answer:**

Let the smallest of the three consecutive odd numbers be represented by 'x'. Since they are consecutive odd numbers, the next two numbers will be x + 2 and x + 4.

The question states that the sum of these three numbers is <fact1>123</fact1>.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = <fact1>123</fact1>

Simplifying this equation:

3x + 6 = <fact1>123</fact1>
3x = <fact1>123</fact1> - 6
3x = 117
x = 117 / 3
x = 39

Therefore, the smallest of the three consecutive odd numbers is 39.

1389,The sum of three consecutive numbers is 90. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?,"**Reformatted Question:** The sum of three consecutive numbers is <fact1>90</fact1>. What is the smallest of the three numbers?

**Answer:**

Let the smallest of the three consecutive numbers be *x*. The next two consecutive numbers would then be *x* + 1 and *x* + 2.

The question states that the sum of these three numbers is <fact1>90</fact1>.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

*x* + (*x* + 1) + (*x* + 2) = <fact1>90</fact1>

Simplifying the equation:

3*x* + 3 = <fact1>90</fact1>

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

3*x* = 87

Dividing both sides by 3:

*x* = 29

Therefore, the smallest of the three numbers is 29. The answer is {29}.

If the number of <fact2>girls</fact2> is <fact3>106 more</fact3> than the <fact4>boys</fact4>, how many <fact4>boys</fact4> are there in the school?

**Answer:**

Let 'b' represent the number of boys in the school. Since there are <fact3>106 more girls</fact3> than boys, the number of girls can be represented as b + <fact3>106</fact3>.

The total number of students in the school is <fact1>650</fact1>.  This total is made up of both <fact2>girls</fact2> and <fact4>boys</fact4>. Therefore, we can write the equation:

b + (b + 106) = <fact1>650</fact1>

Simplifying the equation:

2b + 106 = 650

Subtract 106 from both sides:

2b = 544

Divide both sides by 2:

b = 272

Therefore, there are 272 <fact4>boys</fact4> in the school.

1393,"A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.","**Reformatted Question:** A man is <fact1>thrice as old as his son</fact1>. After <fact2>12 years</fact2>, he will be <fact3>twice as old as his son</fact3>. Find their present ages.

**Answer:**

Let's assume the son's current age is 'x' years.
According to the question (<fact1>), the man's current age is '3x' years.

After <fact2>12 years</fact2>:
* The son's age will be x + 12 years.
* The man's age will be 3x + 12 years.

The problem states that after <fact2>12 years</fact2>, the man will be <fact3>twice as old as his son</fact3>.  This can be written as an equation:

3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)

Solving for x:
3x + 12 = 2x + 24
3x - 2x = 24 - 12
x = 12

Therefore, the son's present age is 12 years.
The man's present age is 3 * x = 3 * 12 = 36 years.

So, the son's present age is 12 years and the man's present age is 36 years.

**Answer:**

Let Vidya's present age be V.
According to the problem, <fact1>Vidya's mother's age is 5 years more than three times Vidya's present age</fact1>.  We can represent this as:

Mother's age = 3V + 5

We are also given that <fact3>her mother is 44 years old</fact3>. Therefore:

44 = 3V + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

44 - 5 = 3V
39 = 3V

Dividing both sides by 3:

V = 39 / 3
V = 13

Therefore, <fact2>Vidya's present age</fact2> is 13 years old. The answer is {13}.

Find their present ages.

**Answer:**

Let Neil's present age be 'x' years.
From <fact1>, Mrs. Martin's present age is x + <fact1>27</fact1> years.

After <fact2>8 years</fact2>:
Neil's age will be x + <fact2>8</fact2> years.
Mrs. Martin's age will be (x + <fact1>27</fact1>) + <fact2>8</fact2> = x + 35 years.

According to <fact3>, after 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil.  So:

x + 35 = <fact3>2</fact3>(x + <fact2>8</fact2>)
x + 35 = 2x + 16
35 - 16 = 2x - x

1400,"In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The vertex angle is twice either base angle. What are the angles of the triangle?","**Reformatted Question:** In an <fact1>isosceles triangle</fact1>, the <fact2>base angles</fact2> are <fact3>equal</fact3>. The <fact4>vertex angle</fact4> is <fact5>twice either base angle</fact5>. What are the angles of the triangle?

**Answer:**

Let's denote the measure of each base angle (<fact2>) as 'x'.  Since the base angles are equal (<fact3>), both base angles measure x degrees. The vertex angle (<fact4>) is twice either base angle (<fact5>), so it measures 2x degrees.

Because the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up an equation:

x + x + 2x = 180

Simplifying, we get:

4x = 180

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 45

Therefore, each base angle measures 45 degrees.  The vertex angle measures 2 * 45 = 90 degrees.

So, the angles of the isosceles triangle (<fact1>) are 45 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees.

1401,"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?","**Reformatted Question:** Two boys have <fact1>480 marbles</fact1> between them. One arranges them in heaps of <fact2>6 marbles</fact2> and the other in heaps of <fact3>9</fact3> each. If the <fact4>total number of heaps</fact4> is <fact5>72</fact5>, how many marbles does each have?


**Answer:**

Let's say the first boy makes 'x' heaps of 6 marbles each, and the second boy makes 'y' heaps of 9 marbles each.

From the problem, we know that the total number of heaps is <fact5>72</fact5>.  So, we can write this as an equation:

x + y = <fact5>72</fact5>

We also know that the total number of marbles is <fact1>480</fact1>. Since the first boy has heaps of <fact2>6</fact2> and the second boy has heaps of <fact3>9</fact3>, we can write another equation:

<fact2>6</fact2>x + <fact3>9</fact3>y = <fact1>480</fact1>

Now we have two equations:

1) x + y = <fact5>72</fact5>
2) <fact2>6</fact2>x + <fact3>9</fact3>y = <fact1>480</fact1>

We can solve for x and y.  From equation (1), we can express x in terms of y:

x = <fact5>72</fact5> - y

Substitute this value of x into equation (2):

<fact2>6</fact2>(<fact5>72</fact5> - y) + <fact3>9</fact3>y = <fact1>480</fact1>
432 - 6y + 9y = <fact1>480</fact1>
3y = <fact1>480</fact1> - 432
3y = 48
y = 16

Now substitute y = 16 back into x = <fact5>72</fact5> - y:

x = <fact5>72</fact5> - 16
x = 56

So, the first boy has 56 heaps of <fact2>6</fact2> marbles each, totaling 56 * <fact2>6</fact2> = 336 marbles.
The second boy has 16 heaps of <fact3>9</fact3> marbles each, totaling 16 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 144 marbles.


Therefore, the first boy has 336 marbles, and the second boy has 144 marbles.

Length of a rectangle is <fact1>8 m less than twice its width</fact1>. If the <fact2>perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m</fact2>, find its length and width.

                    Answer:
Let's represent the width of the rectangle as 'w' meters.  According to <fact1>the question</fact1>, the length ('l') is 8 meters less than twice the width.  We can express this as:
l = 2w - 8

The <fact2>perimeter of a rectangle</fact2> is given by the formula:  P = 2(l + w)
We are given that the <fact2>perimeter is 56 m</fact2>. Substituting this and the expression for 'l' into the perimeter formula:

56 = 2((2w - 8) + w)
56 = 2(3w - 8)
56 = 6w - 16
72 = 6w
w = 12

So the width is 12 meters.  Now we can find the length using the expression for 'l':
l = 2w - 8
l = 2(12) - 8
l = 24 - 8
l = 16

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 16 meters and the width is 12 meters.

1406,"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?","**Reformatted Question:** Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. <fact1>Five years ago</fact1>, <fact2>Jacob's age was seven times</fact2> that of his son. What are their present ages?

**Answer:**

Let J be Jacob's current age and S be his son's current age.

* **Five years hence:**  Jacob's age will be J + 5 and his son's age will be S + 5.  The problem states that Jacob's age will be three times his son's age.  Therefore:

  J + 5 = 3(S + 5)
  J + 5 = 3S + 15
  J = 3S + 10

* **<fact1>Five years ago</fact1>:** Jacob's age was J - 5 and his son's age was S - 5. The problem states that <fact2>Jacob's age was seven times his son's age</fact2>. Therefore:

  J - 5 = 7(S - 5)
  J - 5 = 7S - 35
  J = 7S - 30

Now we have two equations:

1. J = 3S + 10
2. J = 7S - 30

Since both equations equal J, we can set them equal to each other:

3S + 10 = 7S - 30
40 = 4S
S = 10

Now substitute S = 10 back into either equation to find J. Using equation 1:

J = 3(10) + 10
J = 30 + 10
J = 40

Therefore, Jacob's present age is 40 and his son's present age is 10.

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","**Reformatted Question:**

Five years ago, I was <fact1>thrice as old as my son</fact1>. Ten years later, I shall be <fact2>twice as old as my son</fact2>. How old are we now?

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the current age of the father and 'y' be the current age of the son.

From the first statement, ""<fact1>Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son</fact1>"", we can form the equation:
x - 5 = 3(y - 5)
x - 5 = 3y - 15
x = 3y - 10  --- Equation (1)

From the second statement, ""<fact2>Ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son</fact2>"", we can form the equation:
x + 10 = 2(y + 10)
x + 10 = 2y + 20
x = 2y + 10  --- Equation (2)

Now we have two equations with two variables:

Equation (1): x = 3y - 10
Equation (2): x = 2y + 10

Since both equations equal 'x', we can set them equal to each other:
3y - 10 = 2y + 10
y = 20

Now substitute the value of y (20) back into either Equation (1) or (2) to solve for x.  Using Equation (2):
x = 2(20) + 10
x = 50

So, the father is currently 50 years old and the son is 20 years old.

The answer is:  The father is 50 and the son is 20.

A's <fact2>father</fact2> D is <fact3>twice as old as</fact3> A and B is <fact4>twice old as</fact4> his <fact5>sister</fact5> C. The <fact6>ages of D and C differ by 40 years</fact6>. Find the ages of A and B.


**Answer:**

Let's represent the ages as follows:

* A's age:  a
* B's age: b
* C's age: c
* D's age: d

From the given information, we can form the following equations:

1. <fact1>A is two years older than B:</fact1> a = b + 2
2. <fact3>D is twice as old as A:</fact3> d = 2a
3. <fact4>B is twice old as his sister C:</fact4> b = 2c
4. <fact6>The ages of D and C differ by 40 years:</fact6> d - c = 40

Now we can solve for the ages of A and B.

Substitute equation (2) into equation (4):

2a - c = 40

From equation (3), c = b/2.  Substitute this into the previous equation:

2a - b/2 = 40

From equation (1), a = b + 2. Substitute this into the previous equation:

2(b + 2) - b/2 = 40

Simplify and solve for b:

2b + 4 - b/2 = 40
4b + 8 - b = 80
3b = 72
b = 24

Now substitute the value of b back into equation (1) to find a:

a = 24 + 2
a = 26

Therefore, A is 26 years old and B is 24 years old.

1409,"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son. Find the present ages of father and son.","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. <fact1>Two years later</fact1>, his age will be <fact2>8 more than</fact2> the age of the son. Find the <fact3>present ages</fact3> of father and son.


Let 'f' represent the father's current age and 's' represent the son's current age.

Two years ago, the father's age was f-2 and the son's age was s-2.  According to the problem, the father was five times as old as his son at that time. This can be written as:

f - 2 = 5(s - 2)
f - 2 = 5s - 10
f = 5s - 8  (Equation 1)

<fact1>Two years later</fact1>, the father's age will be f+2 and the son's age will be s+2. The problem states the father's age will be <fact2>8 more than</fact2> the son's age. This can be written as:

f + 2 = (s + 2) + 8
f + 2 = s + 10
f = s + 8  (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations with two variables:

Equation 1: f = 5s - 8
Equation 2: f = s + 8

Since both equations are equal to 'f', we can set them equal to each other:

5s - 8 = s + 8
4s = 16
s = 4

So the son's current age is 4 years old.  We can substitute this value back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find the father's age. Using Equation 2:

f = s + 8
f = 4 + 8
f = 12

So the father's current age is 12 years old.  Therefore, the <fact3>present ages</fact3> of the father and son are 12 and 4, respectively.


The answer is {Father: 12, Son: 4}.

1410,Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the age of father.,"**Reformatted Question:** Father's age is <fact1>three times</fact1> the sum of the ages of his <fact2>two children</fact2>. After <fact3>5 years</fact3> his age will be <fact4>twice</fact4> the sum of age of <fact2>two children</fact2>. Find the age of father.

**Answer:**

Let the father's current age be 'f' and the sum of the ages of his two children be 'c'.

From the first statement ""Father's age is <fact1>three times</fact1> the sum of the ages of his <fact2>two children</fact2>"", we can write the equation:

f = 3c

After <fact3>5 years</fact3>, the father's age will be f + 5, and the sum of the ages of his two children will be c + 10 (since there are <fact2>two children</fact2>, each aging by 5 years). The second statement ""After <fact3>5 years</fact3> his age will be <fact4>twice</fact4> the sum of age of <fact2>two children</fact2>"" gives us another equation:

f + 5 = 2(c + 10)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) f = 3c
2) f + 5 = 2c + 20

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

3c + 5 = 2c + 20

Solving for 'c':

c = 15

Now, substitute the value of 'c' back into the first equation to find the father's age (f):

f = 3 * 15
f = 45

Therefore, the father's age is 45.

1411,5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.,"**Reformatted Question:**

5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son <fact1>while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son</fact1>. Find <fact2>the present ages</fact2>.


**Answer:**

Let F be the father's current age and S be the son's current age.

* **5 years hence:**  The father's age will be F + 5 and the son's age will be S + 5.  According to the problem, at this time, the father's age will be three times the son's age.  This can be written as the equation:

> F + 5 = 3(S + 5)

* **5 years earlier:** The father's age was F - 5 and the son's age was S - 5.  According to <fact1>the problem</fact1>, at this time, the father's age was seven times the son's age. This can be written as the equation:

> F - 5 = 7(S - 5)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1. F + 5 = 3S + 15  (Simplifying the first equation)
2. F - 5 = 7S - 35  (Simplifying the second equation)

We can solve this system of equations.  Let's solve for F in the first equation:

> F = 3S + 10

Now substitute this value of F into the second equation:

> (3S + 10) - 5 = 7S - 35
> 3S + 5 = 7S - 35
> 40 = 4S
> S = 10

So the son's current age is 10. Now substitute S = 10 back into either equation to solve for F. Let's use F = 3S + 10:

> F = 3(10) + 10
> F = 40

So the father's current age is 40. Therefore, <fact2>the present ages</fact2> are Father: 40 years old and Son: 10 years old.

**Answer:**

Let 'f' represent the father's current age and 'c' represent the sum of the current ages of his <fact1>5 children</fact1>.

From the question, we know:

* f = c  (The father's age equals the sum of his children's ages)

After <fact2>15 years</fact2>:

* The father's age will be f + 15.
* The sum of the children's ages will be c + (5 * 15) = c + 75 (Each of the <fact1>5 children</fact1> ages by 15 years).

We are also told that after <fact2>15 years</fact2>, the sum of the children's ages will be <fact3>twice</fact3> the father's age:

* c + 75 = 2 * (f + 15)

Now we can substitute f = c (from our initial equation) into this equation:

* c + 75 = 2 * (c + 15)
* c + 75 = 2c + 30
* 75 - 30 = 2c - c
* 45 = c

Since f = c, the father's current age is 45.

Therefore, the age of the father is {45}.

1413,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons <fact1>was one-third of their father's age</fact1>. One son <fact2>is two years older than the other</fact2> and <fact3>sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age</fact3>. Find the <fact4>present ages of all</fact4>.

                    Answer:
Let 'x' and 'y' represent the present ages of the two sons, and 'f' represent the present age of the father.

From ""<fact2>One son is two years older than the other</fact2>"", we can write:
y = x + 2

From ""<fact3>sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age</fact3>"", we can write:
x + y = f - 14
Substituting y = x + 2:
x + (x + 2) = f - 14
2x + 2 = f - 14
2x + 16 = f

Ten years ago, the sons' ages were x - 10 and y - 10, and the father's age was f - 10.
From ""<fact1>the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age</fact1>"", we get:
(x - 10) + (y - 10) = (1/3)(f - 10)
Substituting y = x + 2:
(x - 10) + (x + 2 - 10) = (1/3)(f - 10)
2x - 18 = (1/3)(f - 10)
6x - 54 = f - 10
6x - 44 = f

Now we have two equations for f:
f = 2x + 16
f = 6x - 44
Equating them:
2x + 16 = 6x - 44
60 = 4x
x = 15

Now, find y:
y = x + 2
y = 15 + 2
y = 17

Now, find f:
f = 2x + 16
f = 2(15) + 16
f = 30 + 16
f = 46

Therefore, the <fact4>present ages</fact4> are:
Son 1: 15 years old
Son 2: 17 years old
Father: 46 years old.

1414,"If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. Find the ages of father and son.","**Reformatted Question:**

If <fact1>twice the son's age</fact1> is added to <fact2>the father's age</fact2>, the sum is <fact3>70</fact3>. But if <fact4>twice the father's age</fact4> is added to <fact5>the son's age</fact5>, the sum is <fact6>95</fact6>. Find the ages of father and son.


**Answer:**

Let 's' represent the son's age and 'f' represent the father's age.

We can translate the given information into two equations:

* **Equation 1 (from fact1, fact2, and fact3):** 2s + f = 70
* **Equation 2 (from fact4, fact5, and fact6):** s + 2f = 95

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously.  One way to do this is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for f:**  f = 70 - 2s

2. **Substitute this expression for 'f' into Equation 2:**  s + 2(70 - 2s) = 95

3. **Simplify and solve for 's':**  s + 140 - 4s = 95  =>  -3s = -45  => s = 15

4. **Substitute the value of 's' (15) back into either Equation 1 or the equation we derived for 'f'.  Using the equation for 'f':** f = 70 - 2(15) = 70 - 30 = 40

Therefore, the son's age is 15 and the father's age is 40.

How old am I and how old is my son?

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be my son's current age.
Based on the first fact, my current age is <fact1>3x</fact1>.

<fact2>Five years later</fact2>, my son's age will be x + 5.
<fact2>Five years later</fact2>, my age will be 3x + 5.

According to the second fact, <fact2>five years later</fact2>, I will be <fact3>2.5 times</fact3> my son's age.  So, we can write this as an equation:

3x + 5 = <fact3>2.5</fact3>(x + 5)

Now we solve for x:

3x + 5 = 2.5x + 12.5
0.5x = 7.5
x = 15

So my son's current age is 15 years old.  Since I am <fact1>three times</fact1> his age, my current age is 3 * 15 = 45 years old.

Therefore, I am 45 years old, and my son is 15 years old.

The sum total of the ages of <fact1>father</fact1> and <fact2>son</fact2> is <fact3>55 years</fact3>. If the <fact1>father</fact1> was to live till his <fact2>son's</fact2> age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be <fact4>93 years</fact4>. Find their <fact5>present ages</fact5>.


**Answer:**

Let F be the father's current age and S be the son's current age.
From the first statement, ""The sum total of the ages of <fact1>father</fact1> and <fact2>son</fact2> is <fact3>55 years</fact3>"", we can write the equation:

F + S = <fact3>55</fact3>  --- (1)

The second statement says, ""If the <fact1>father</fact1> was to live till his <fact2>son's</fact2> age equals his <fact5>present age</fact5> (F)"".  This means the son's age increases by (F-S) years.  During this time, the father's age also increases by the same amount (F-S) years.

So, at that future time, the father's age will be F + (F - S) = 2F - S, and the son's age will be S + (F - S) = F.
The question states that the total of their ages at that future time would be <fact4>93 years</fact4>.  So, we have the equation:

(2F - S) + F = <fact4>93</fact4>
3F - S = <fact4>93</fact4>  --- (2)


Now we have two equations:
1. F + S = 55
2. 3F - S = 93

Adding equations (1) and (2), we get:
4F = 148
F = 148/4 = 37

Substitute the value of F in equation (1):
37 + S = 55
S = 55 - 37 = 18

Therefore, the <fact5>present ages</fact5> are:  Father is 37 years old, and Son is 18 years old.  The <fact1>father's</fact1> <fact5>present age</fact5> is 37 and the <fact2>son's</fact2> <fact5>present age</fact5> is 18.

The ages of two friends <fact1>Anna</fact1> and <fact2>Ben</fact2> differ by <fact3>3 years</fact3>. <fact1>Anna's</fact1> father <fact4>Denver</fact4> is twice as old as <fact1>Anna</fact1> and <fact2>Ben</fact2> is twice as old as his sister <fact5>Cathy</fact5>. The ages of <fact5>Cathy</fact5> and <fact4>Denver</fact4> differ by <fact6>30 years</fact6>. Find the ages of <fact1>Anna</fact1> and <fact2>Ben</fact2>.


**Answer:**

Let 'a' represent Anna's age, 'b' represent Ben's age, 'd' represent Denver's age, and 'c' represent Cathy's age.

From the question, we know the following:

1.  |a - b| = <fact3>3</fact3> (The difference in ages between Anna and Ben is 3 years. We use absolute value because we don't know who is older.)
2.  d = 2a (<fact4>Denver</fact4> is twice as old as <fact1>Anna</fact1>.)
3.  b = 2c (<fact2>Ben</fact2> is twice as old as his sister <fact5>Cathy</fact5>.)
4.  |d - c| = <fact6>30</fact6> (The age difference between <fact5>Cathy</fact5> and <fact4>Denver</fact4> is 30 years.)

We can express 'c' in terms of 'b' using equation 3: c = b/2

Now, substitute this into equation 4: |2a - b/2| = <fact6>30</fact6>

We have two cases to consider because of the absolute value:

*   **Case 1:** 2a - b/2 = 30
*   **Case 2:** 2a - b/2 = -30

Also, we have two sub-cases for each case due to the absolute value in the first equation:

*   **Sub-case 1a:** a - b = <fact3>3</fact3>
*   **Sub-case 1b:** a - b = -<fact3>3</fact3>
*   **Sub-case 2a:** a - b = <fact3>3</fact3>
*   **Sub-case 2b:** a - b = -<fact3>3</fact3>

Let's solve for each combination:

*   **Case 1 & Sub-case 1a:** Solving simultaneously gives a = 21 and b = 18.
*   **Case 1 & Sub-case 1b:** Solving simultaneously gives a=19 and b=22.
*   **Case 2 & Sub-case 2a:** Solving simultaneously gives a = 9 and b = 6.
*   **Case 2 & Sub-case 2b:** Solving simultaneously gives a = 11 and b = 14.

Now check the ages against the conditions given in the question.

*    For a=21 and b=18, d = 42 and c=9. |42-9| = 33. Doesn't satisfy the condition |d-c| = 30.
*    For a=19 and b=22, d = 38 and c=11. |38-11|=27. Doesn't satisfy the condition |d-c| = 30.
*    For a=9 and b=6, d=18 and c=3. |18-3| = 15. Doesn't satisfy the condition |d-c| = 30.
*    For a=11 and b=14, d=22 and c=7. |22-7| = 15. Doesn't satisfy the condition |d-c| = 30.

We seem to have an issue. Let's reconsider the last condition:  |d - c| = <fact6>30</fact6>. Substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'c' we derived earlier:

|2a - b/2| = 30

Since a-b=3 or b-a=3, we have b=a-3 or b=a+3.  Let's try these:


If b = a-3, then:
|2a-(a-3)/2| = 30
|3a/2 + 3/2| = 30
3a/2 + 3/2 = 30 or 3a/2 + 3/2 = -30.

3a+3=60 or 3a+3=-60
3a = 57 or 3a=-63
a=19 or a=-21.  Since age cannot be negative, a=19 and thus b=16.

If b = a+3, then:
|2a - (a+3)/2| = 30
|3a/2 - 3/2| = 30
3a/2 - 3/2 = 30 or 3a/2 - 3/2 = -30

3a-3 = 60 or 3a-3=-60
3a=63 or 3a=-57
a=21 or a=-19. Since age cannot be negative, a=21 and thus b=24.


Thus, Anna is 19 and Ben is 16 OR Anna is 21 and Ben is 24. 

If Anna is 19, Denver is 38, Cathy is 8. |38-8|=30.
If Anna is 21, Denver is 42, Cathy is 12. |42-12|=30.

Both pairs of ages satisfy the conditions.

Five years ago, <fact1>Nancy was thrice as old as Sam</fact1>. <fact2>Ten years later</fact2>, <fact3>Nancy will be twice as old as Sam</fact3>. How old are Nancy and Sam?

Let N be Nancy's current age and S be Sam's current age.

From ""<fact1>Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam</fact1>"", we can write the equation:
N - 5 = 3(S - 5)
N - 5 = 3S - 15
N = 3S - 10  (Equation 1)

From ""<fact2>Ten years later</fact2>, <fact3>Nancy will be twice as old as Sam</fact3>"", we can write the equation:
N + 10 = 2(S + 10)
N + 10 = 2S + 20
N = 2S + 10  (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations with two variables:
N = 3S - 10 (Equation 1)
N = 2S + 10 (Equation 2)

Since both equations are equal to N, we can set them equal to each other:
3S - 10 = 2S + 10
3S - 2S = 10 + 10
S = 20

Substitute the value of S back into Equation 2:
N = 2(20) + 10
N = 40 + 10
N = 50

Therefore, Nancy is 50 years old and Sam is 20 years old.

Seven times a two-digit number <fact1>is equal to</fact1> four times the number obtained <fact2>by reversing the order of digits</fact2> and the <fact3>sum of the digits is 3</fact3>. Find the number.

                    Answer:
Let the two-digit number be 10a + b, where a and b are the digits.
<fact2>Reversing the digits</fact2> gives us the number 10b + a.
According to the problem, seven times the original number <fact1>is equal to</fact1> four times the reversed number. So,
7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)
70a + 7b = 40b + 4a
66a = 33b
2a = b

Also, the problem states that the <fact3>sum of the digits is 3</fact3>. So,
a + b = 3

Substituting b = 2a in the above equation:
a + 2a = 3
3a = 3
a = 1

Now, substitute a = 1 back into b = 2a:
b = 2 * 1
b = 2

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 2 = 12.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12}$

1420,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

A two digit number is <fact1>four times the sum of its digits</fact1> and <fact2>twice the product of the digits</fact2>. Find the number.

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits respectively.

From the given information, we can form two equations:

*  <fact1>10a + b = 4(a + b)</fact1>
*  <fact2>10a + b = 2(a * b)</fact2>

Simplifying the first equation (<fact1>10a + b = 4(a + b)</fact1>):
10a + b = 4a + 4b
6a = 3b
2a = b

Now we substitute b = 2a into the second equation (<fact2>10a + b = 2(a * b)</fact2>):
10a + 2a = 2(a * 2a)
12a = 4a²
Since a cannot be 0 (as it's the tens digit), we can divide both sides by 4a:
3 = a

Now that we have a = 3, we can find b using b = 2a:
b = 2 * 3
b = 6

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(3) + 6 = 36.

**Answer:**

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' and 'b' are the tens and units digits, respectively.

From <fact1>""A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits""</fact1>, we can write the equation:

10a + b = 7(a + b)
10a + b = 7a + 7b
3a = 6b
a = 2b  --- Equation (1)

From <fact2>""When 27 is subtracted from the number""</fact2> and <fact3>""the digits interchange places""</fact3>, we can write another equation:

10a + b - 27 = 10b + a
9a - 9b = 27
a - b = 3 --- Equation (2)

Substitute Equation (1) (a = 2b) into Equation (2):

2b - b = 3
b = 3

Now, substitute the value of b back into Equation (1):

a = 2 * 3
a = 6

Therefore, the number is 10a + b = 10*6 + 3 = 63.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{63}$

1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.","**Reformatted Question:**

In a two-digit number, the sum of the two digits is <fact1>9</fact1>. If the digits are reversed, the number is increased by <fact2>9</fact2>. Find the number.


**Answer:**

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.

From the first statement, we know that the sum of the digits is <fact1>9</fact1>. This can be expressed as:

a + b = <fact1>9</fact1>

The second statement says that if the digits are reversed (i.e., the number becomes 10b + a), the number is increased by <fact2>9</fact2>.  This can be written as:

10b + a = 10a + b + <fact2>9</fact2>

Simplifying this equation, we get:

9b - 9a = <fact2>9</fact2>
b - a = 1
b = a + 1


Now we have a system of two equations:

1. a + b = <fact1>9</fact1>
2. b = a + 1

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:

a + (a + 1) = <fact1>9</fact1>
2a + 1 = <fact1>9</fact1>
2a = 8
a = 4

Now, substitute the value of 'a' back into the equation b = a + 1:

b = 4 + 1
b = 5

So, the original number is 10a + b = 10(4) + 5 = 45.

Therefore, the number is 45.

Find the number.

**Answer:**

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively.

From <fact2>""The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 15,""</fact2> we can write the equation:

a + b = 15

From <fact3>""The number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed,""</fact3> we can write the equation:

10a + b - 27 = 10b + a

Simplifying this equation, we get:

9a - 9b = 27

Dividing both sides by 9:

a - b = 3

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1) a + b = 15
2) a - b = 3

Adding equations (1) and (2):

2a = 18

a = 9

Substituting the value of a back into equation (1):

9 + b = 15

b = 6

So, the original two-digit number is 10a + b = 10 * 9 + 6 = 96.

Therefore, the number is 96.

1424,"In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number.","**Reformatted Question:**

In a two-digit number, the <fact1>tens digit</fact1> is <fact2>three times</fact2> the <fact3>unit digit</fact3>. When the number is <fact4>decreased by 54</fact4>, the <fact5>digits are reversed</fact5>. Find the number.

**Answer:**

Let 't' represent the tens digit and 'u' represent the units digit.
From ""<fact1>tens digit</fact1> is <fact2>three times</fact2> the <fact3>unit digit</fact3>"", we can write the equation:  t = 3u.

The original two-digit number can be represented as 10t + u.
The reversed number can be represented as 10u + t.

From ""When the number is <fact4>decreased by 54</fact4>, the <fact5>digits are reversed</fact5>"", we have the equation:
10t + u - 54 = 10u + t

Substituting t = 3u into the second equation:
10(3u) + u - 54 = 10u + 3u
30u + u - 54 = 13u
31u - 54 = 13u
31u - 13u = 54
18u = 54
u = 54 / 18
u = 3

Now, substitute the value of u back into t = 3u:
t = 3 * 3
t = 9

So, the original number is 10t + u = 10*9 + 3 = 93.

Therefore, the number is 93.

1425,The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 8 and the difference between the number and that formed by reversing the digits is 18. Find the number.,"**Reformatted Question:**

The sum of the digits of a <fact1>two-digit number</fact1> is <fact2>8</fact2>. The difference between the number and that formed by <fact3>reversing the digits</fact3> is <fact4>18</fact4>. Find the number.


**Answer:**

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the digits.

From the question, we know the following:

* **Fact 2:** The sum of the digits is 8:  a + b = <fact2>8</fact2>
* **Fact 3 & 4:** The difference between the number and its reversed form is 18: |(10a + b) - (10b + a)| = <fact4>18</fact4>.  This simplifies to |9a - 9b| = 18, which further simplifies to |a - b| = 2.

Now we have two equations:

1. a + b = 8
2. |a - b| = 2

This second equation gives us two possibilities:

* a - b = 2
* b - a = 2  (or a - b = -2)

Let's solve the system of equations for each possibility:

**Possibility 1: a - b = 2**

Adding the two equations (a + b = 8 and a - b = 2) gives 2a = 10, so a = 5.  Substituting a = 5 into a + b = 8 gives 5 + b = 8, so b = 3. The number is 53.

**Possibility 2: b - a = 2**

Adding the two equations (a + b = 8 and b - a = 2) gives 2b = 10, so b = 5. Substituting b = 5 into a + b = 8 gives a + 5 = 8, so a = 3.  The number is 35.

Now, let's check the difference between the number and its reversed form for both possibilities:

* **53:** |53 - 35| = 18 (This matches <fact4>the given difference</fact4>)
* **35:** |35 - 53| = 18 (This also matches <fact4>the given difference</fact4>)


Since both 53 and 35 satisfy the conditions given in the problem, there are two possible solutions: 35 and 53. However, if the question intends for the original number to be *larger* than its reversed form, then the answer is 53.

1426,"A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.","**Reformatted Question:**

A boat goes <fact1>30 km upstream</fact1> and <fact2>44 km downstream</fact2> in <fact3>10 hours</fact3>. In <fact4>13 hours</fact4>, it can go <fact5>40 km upstream</fact5> and <fact6>55 km downstream</fact6>. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.


**Answer:**

Let the speed of the boat in still water be 'b' km/h and the speed of the stream be 's' km/h.

When going upstream, the boat's effective speed is (b - s) km/h, and when going downstream, it's (b + s) km/h.

From the first part of the problem (<fact1>30 km upstream</fact1>, <fact2>44 km downstream</fact2> in <fact3>10 hours</fact3>), we can form the equation:

<fact1>30</fact1>/(b - s) + <fact2>44</fact2>/(b + s) = <fact3>10</fact3>  --- (Equation 1)

From the second part of the problem (<fact5>40 km upstream</fact5>, <fact6>55 km downstream</fact6> in <fact4>13 hours</fact4>), we can form the equation:

<fact5>40</fact5>/(b - s) + <fact6>55</fact6>/(b + s) = <fact4>13</fact4> --- (Equation 2)


To solve these equations, we can use a substitution method. Let 1/(b - s) = x and 1/(b + s) = y.

Equation 1 becomes: 30x + 44y = 10
Equation 2 becomes: 40x + 55y = 13

Multiply Equation 1 by 4: 120x + 176y = 40
Multiply Equation 2 by 3: 120x + 165y = 39

Subtract the second equation from the first: 11y = 1
Therefore, y = 1/11.

Substitute y = 1/11 back into 30x + 44y = 10:
30x + 44(1/11) = 10
30x + 4 = 10
30x = 6
x = 6/30 = 1/5


Now, substitute the values of x and y back into our original substitutions:

1/(b - s) = 1/5  =>  b - s = 5
1/(b + s) = 1/11 =>  b + s = 11

Add these two equations: 2b = 16
Therefore, b = 8 km/h (speed of the boat in still water)

Substitute b = 8 into b + s = 11:
8 + s = 11
s = 3 km/h (speed of the stream)

1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.","**Reformatted Question:**

Tara can row downstream <fact1>20 km</fact1> in <fact2>2 hours</fact2>, and upstream <fact3>4 km</fact3> in <fact4>2 hours</fact4>. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.


**Answer:**

Let 'x' be Tara's speed of rowing in still water and 'y' be the speed of the current.

When rowing downstream, the speed of the current adds to Tara's rowing speed.  Therefore, her downstream speed is x + y.  We know from the question that she can row downstream <fact1>20 km</fact1> in <fact2>2 hours</fact2>.  So, we can write the equation:

x + y = <fact1>20</fact1>/<fact2>2</fact2>
x + y = 10  (Equation 1)

When rowing upstream, the speed of the current opposes Tara's rowing speed.  Therefore, her upstream speed is x - y. We know from the question that she can row upstream <fact3>4 km</fact3> in <fact4>2 hours</fact4>.  So, we can write the equation:

x - y = <fact3>4</fact3>/<fact4>2</fact4>
x - y = 2  (Equation 2)


Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

x + y = 10 (Equation 1)
x - y = 2 (Equation 2)


We can solve these equations simultaneously. Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 eliminates 'y':

2x = 12
x = 6

Substituting the value of x (6) back into Equation 1:

6 + y = 10
y = 4

Therefore, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/h, and the speed of the current is 4 km/h.

1428,A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.,"**Reformatted Question:** A sailor goes <fact1>8 km downstream</fact1> in <fact2>40 minutes</fact2> and comes back in <fact3>1 hour</fact3>. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.

**Answer:**

Let's denote the speed of the sailor in still water as 's' km/hr and the speed of the current as 'c' km/hr.

When going downstream, the sailor's speed is increased by the current.  So, the effective speed downstream is (s + c) km/hr.  We are given that the sailor covers <fact1>8 km downstream</fact1> in <fact2>40 minutes (which is 40/60 = 2/3 hours)</fact2>. Therefore, we can write the equation:

(s + c) * (2/3) = <fact1>8</fact1>
s + c = 12  --- (Equation 1)


When coming upstream, the current opposes the sailor's motion. Thus, the effective speed upstream is (s - c) km/hr.  We are told the sailor takes <fact3>1 hour</fact3> to cover the same <fact1>8 km</fact1> distance upstream. Therefore:

(s - c) * <fact3>1</fact3> = <fact1>8</fact1>
s - c = 8  --- (Equation 2)


Now we have two equations with two unknowns (s and c):

Equation 1: s + c = 12
Equation 2: s - c = 8

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Adding the two equations eliminates 'c':

2s = 20
s = 10

Substituting the value of s (10) into either equation allows us to find c. Using Equation 1:

10 + c = 12
c = 2

Therefore, the speed of the sailor in still water is 10 km/hr and the speed of the current is 2 km/hr.

Points A and B are <fact1>70 km apart</fact1> on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B <fact2>at the same time</fact2>. If they <fact3>travel in the same direction</fact3>, they <fact4>meet in 7 hours</fact4>, but if they <fact5>travel towards each other</fact5> they <fact6>meet in one hour</fact6>. What are their respective speeds?

Let the speed of the car starting from A be 'x' km/h and the speed of the car starting from B be 'y' km/h.

When they travel in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of their speeds, since they are moving away from each other.  According to the question, it takes them <fact4>7 hours to meet</fact4> when they <fact3>travel in the same direction</fact3>, and the distance between them is closing at a rate of |x - y| km/h. They meet when the faster car has covered 70km more than the slower car.

So,  <fact4>7</fact4>|x - y| = <fact1>70</fact1>
|x - y| = 10  ---(1)

When they travel towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds. According to the question, it takes them <fact6>one hour to meet</fact6> when they <fact5>travel towards each other</fact5>.

So, <fact6>1</fact6>(x + y) = <fact1>70</fact1>
x + y = 70  ---(2)

Now we have two equations:

|x - y| = 10
x + y = 70


Case 1: x > y
x - y = 10
x + y = 70
Adding the two equations:
2x = 80
x = 40 km/h
Substituting the value of x in equation (2):
40 + y = 70
y = 30 km/h


Case 2: x < y
y - x = 10
x + y = 70
Adding the two equations:
2y = 80
y = 40 km/h
Substituting the value of y in equation (2):
x + 40 = 70
x = 30 km/h

In either case, the speeds are 30 km/h and 40 km/h.

1430,"Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.","**Reformatted Question:**

Amy traveled <fact1>300 km by train</fact1> and <fact2>200 km by taxi</fact2>, it took him <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3>. But if he travels <fact4>260 km by train</fact4> and <fact5>240 km by taxi</fact5> he takes <fact6>6 minutes longer</fact6>. Find the speed of the train and taxi.


**Answer:**

Let the speed of the train be 'x' km/h and the speed of the taxi be 'y' km/h.

From the first part of the question:

Time taken by train = <fact1>Distance by train</fact1> / Speed of train = <fact1>300</fact1>/x hours
Time taken by taxi = <fact2>Distance by taxi</fact2> / Speed of taxi = <fact2>200</fact2>/y hours
Total time taken = <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3> = 5.5 hours

Therefore, we have the equation:
<fact1>300</fact1>/x + <fact2>200</fact2>/y = <fact3>5.5</fact3>  --- (1)


From the second part of the question:

Time taken by train = <fact4>Distance by train</fact4> / Speed of train = <fact4>260</fact4>/x hours
Time taken by taxi = <fact5>Distance by taxi</fact5> / Speed of taxi = <fact5>240</fact5>/y hours
Total time taken = <fact3>5 hours 30 minutes</fact3> + <fact6>6 minutes</fact6> = 5.5 + 0.1 = 5.6 hours

Therefore, we have the equation:
<fact4>260</fact4>/x + <fact5>240</fact5>/y = <fact6>5.6</fact6>  --- (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve them simultaneously.

Multiply equation (1) by 1.2:
360/x + 240/y = 6.6 --- (3)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (3):
(360/x - <fact4>260</fact4>/x) + (240/y - <fact5>240</fact5>/y) = 6.6 - <fact6>5.6</fact6>
100/x = 1
x = 100 km/h

Substitute x = 100 in equation (1):
<fact1>300</fact1>/100 + <fact2>200</fact2>/y = <fact3>5.5</fact3>
3 + 200/y = 5.5
200/y = 2.5
y = 200/2.5
y = 80 km/h

Therefore, the speed of the train is 100 km/h and the speed of the taxi is 80 km/h.

But if he travels 200 km by train and rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and that of car.","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

A man travels <total_distance>600 km</total_distance> partly by train and partly by car. If he covers <train_distance_1>400 km</train_distance_1> by train and the rest by car, it takes him <time_1>6 hours and 30 minutes</time_1>. But if he travels <train_distance_2>200 km</train_distance_2> by train and rest by car, he takes <time_2>30 minutes longer</time_2>. Find the speed of train and that of car.

Let the speed of the train be 'x' km/h and the speed of the car be 'y' km/h.

Scenario 1:
Distance covered by train: <train_distance_1>400 km</train_distance_1>
Distance covered by car: <total_distance>600 km</total_distance> - <train_distance_1>400 km</train_distance_1> = 200 km
Time taken: <time_1>6 hours 30 minutes</time_1> = 6.5 hours

We know that time = distance/speed. Therefore:
400/x + 200/y = 6.5  --- Equation (1)

Scenario 2:
Distance covered by train: <train_distance_2>200 km</train_distance_2>
Distance covered by car: <total_distance>600 km</total_distance> - <train_distance_2>200 km</train_distance_2> = 400 km
Time taken: <time_1>6 hours 30 minutes</time_1> + <time_2>30 minutes</time_2> = 7 hours

Therefore:
200/x + 400/y = 7  --- Equation (2)

Multiplying Equation (2) by 2, we get:
400/x + 800/y = 14  --- Equation (3)

Subtracting Equation (1) from Equation (3):
(400/x + 800/y) - (400/x + 200/y) = 14 - 6.5
600/y = 7.5
y = 600/7.5 = 80 km/h

Substituting the value of 'y' in Equation (1):
400/x + 200/80 = 6.5
400/x + 2.5 = 6.5
400/x = 4
x = 400/4 = 100 km/h

Therefore, the speed of the train is 100 km/h and the speed of the car is 80 km/h.


Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{100, 80}$

The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of <fact1>10 km</fact1>, the charge paid is <fact2>$75</fact2> and for a journey of <fact3>15 km</fact3>, the charge paid is <fact4>$110</fact4>. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of <fact5>25 km</fact5>?

Let 'x' be the fixed charge and 'y' be the charge per km.
From the given information, we can form two equations:
Equation 1 (based on <fact1>10 km journey and <fact2>$75 charge</fact2>): x + 10y = 75
Equation 2 (based on <fact3>15 km journey and <fact4>$110 charge</fact4>): x + 15y = 110

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:
(x + 15y) - (x + 10y) = 110 - 75
5y = 35
y = 35/5
y = 7

Now, substitute the value of y (charge per km) back into Equation 1:
x + 10 * 7 = 75
x + 70 = 75
x = 75 - 70
x = 5

So, the fixed charge is $5 and the charge per km is $7.

To calculate the charge for a <fact5>25 km</fact5> journey:
Total charge = Fixed charge + (Charge per km * Distance)
Total charge = 5 + (7 * <fact5>25</fact5>)
Total charge = 5 + 175
Total charge = 180

Therefore, a person will have to pay $180 for traveling a distance of <fact5>25 km</fact5>.

The answer is {180}.

A railway half ticket costs <fact1>half the full fare</fact1> and the <fact2>reservation charge is the same</fact2> on half ticket as on full ticket. One <fact3>reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216</fact3> and one <fact4>full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327</fact4>. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?

Let 'f' be the full fare and 'r' be the reservation charge.

From <fact3>the given information</fact3>, we can form the equation:
f + r = 216   --- (1)

From <fact4>the given information</fact4>, we can form the equation:
(f + r) + (f/2 + r) = 327
Simplifying, we get:
3f/2 + 2r = 327   --- (2)

Multiplying equation (1) by 2:
2f + 2r = 432   --- (3)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (3):
(2f + 2r) - (3f/2 + 2r) = 432 - 327
2f - 3f/2 = 105
f/2 = 105
f = 210

Substituting the value of f in equation (1):
210 + r = 216
r = 216 - 210
r = 6

Therefore, the basic first-class full fare is $210 and the reservation charge is $6.

A man walks a certain <fact1>distance</fact1> with a certain <fact2>speed</fact2>. If he walks <fact3>1/2 km/hr faster</fact3>, he takes <fact4>1 hr less</fact4>. But if he walks <fact5>1 km/hr slower</fact5>, he takes <fact6>3 more hours</fact6>. Find the <fact1>distance</fact1> covered by the man and his <fact2>original rate of walking</fact2>.


**Answer:**

Let 'd' be the <fact1>distance</fact1> and 's' be the <fact2>original speed</fact2> in km/hr.
Time taken originally = d/s

According to the first condition, if he walks <fact3>1/2 km/hr faster</fact3>, he takes <fact4>1 hr less</fact4>.
So, d/(s + 1/2) = d/s - <fact4>1</fact4>

According to the second condition, if he walks <fact5>1 km/hr slower</fact5>, he takes <fact6>3 more hours</fact6>.
So, d/(s - <fact5>1</fact5>) = d/s + <fact6>3</fact6>

Now we have two equations:

1. d/(s + 1/2) = d/s - 1
2. d/(s - 1) = d/s + 3


Solving these equations:

From equation (1):
2d/(2s + 1) = (d - s)/s
2ds = (d - s)(2s + 1)
2ds = 2ds + d - 2s² - s
d = 2s² + s

From equation (2):
d/(s - 1) = (d + 3s)/s
ds = (d + 3s)(s - 1)
ds = ds - d + 3s² - 3s
d = 3s² - 3s

Now we have two expressions for 'd':

1. d = 2s² + s
2. d = 3s² - 3s

Setting them equal:
2s² + s = 3s² - 3s
s² - 4s = 0
s(s - 4) = 0
s = 0 (not possible as speed cannot be zero) or s = 4

So, the <fact2>original speed</fact2> is 4 km/hr.

Substituting s = 4 in either equation for 'd':
d = 2(4)² + 4 = 32 + 4 = 36  
OR
d = 3(4)² - 3(4) = 48 - 12 = 36

Thus, the <fact1>distance</fact1> is 36 km.

Final Answer: The distance covered by the man is 36 km, and his original rate of walking is 4 km/hr.

1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"**Reformatted Question:** A car goes uphill at the rate of <fact1>30 km an hour</fact1> and downhill at the rate of <fact2>50 km an hour</fact2>. After <fact3>15 hours</fact3> it has covered <fact4>650 km</fact4>. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the time (in hours) the car traveled uphill, and 'y' be the time (in hours) the car traveled downhill.

From the problem, we know the total time traveled is <fact3>15 hours</fact3>.  So, we can write the equation:

x + y = <fact3>15</fact3>

We also know the total distance covered is <fact4>650 km</fact4>. Since distance = speed * time,  the distance traveled uphill is <fact1>30</fact1>x and the distance traveled downhill is <fact2>50</fact2>y.  This gives us another equation:

<fact1>30</fact1>x + <fact2>50</fact2>y = <fact4>650</fact4>

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1. x + y = 15
2. 30x + 50y = 650

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From equation (1), we can express x as:

x = 15 - y

Substitute this expression for x into equation (2):

30(15 - y) + 50y = 650

450 - 30y + 50y = 650

20y = 200

y = 10

Now substitute y = 10 back into the equation x = 15 - y:

x = 15 - 10

x = 5

So, the car traveled uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

1436,"Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Ronnie travels <total_distance>300 km</total_distance> to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes <time1>4 hours</time1> if she travels <train_distance1>60 km</train_distance1> by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels <train_distance2>100 km</train_distance2> by train and the remaining by bus, she takes <time2>10 minutes longer</time2> (<time2>4 hours 10 minutes</time2>). Find the speed of the train and bus separately.

Answer:
Let the speed of the train be 'x' km/h and the speed of the bus be 'y' km/h.

Scenario 1:

Ronnie travels <train_distance1>60 km</train_distance1> by train and the remaining (<total_distance>300</total_distance> - <train_distance1>60</train_distance1> = 240 km) by bus. The total time taken is <time1>4 hours</time1>.  We can express this as an equation:

<train_distance1>60</train_distance1>/x + 240/y = <time1>4</time1>  ---(1)


Scenario 2:

Ronnie travels <train_distance2>100 km</train_distance2> by train and the remaining (<total_distance>300</total_distance> - <train_distance2>100</train_distance2> = 200 km) by bus. The total time taken is <time2>4 hours 10 minutes</time2>, which is equal to 4 + 10/60 = 4 + 1/6 = 25/6 hours. We can express this as another equation:

<train_distance2>100</train_distance2>/x + 200/y = 25/6  ---(2)


Now we have two equations with two variables.  We can solve them simultaneously.

Multiply equation (1) by 5:

300/x + 1200/y = 20 ---(3)

Multiply equation (2) by 6:

600/x + 1200/y = 25 ---(4)

Subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

300/x = 5
x = 300/5
x = 60

So, the speed of the train is 60 km/h.


Substitute x = 60 into equation (1):

<train_distance1>60</train_distance1>/60 + 240/y = <time1>4</time1>
1 + 240/y = 4
240/y = 3
y = 240/3
y = 80

So, the speed of the bus is 80 km/h.



Final Answer: The speed of the train is 60 km/h and the speed of the bus is 80 km/h.

1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","**Reformatted Question:**

A train covered a certain distance <fact1>at a uniform speed</fact1>. If the train would have been <fact2>6 km/hr faster</fact2> it would have taken <fact3>8 hours less</fact3> than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by <fact4>6 km/hr</fact4>, it would have taken <fact5>12 hours more</fact5> than the scheduled time. Find <question>the length of the journey</question>.


**Answer:**

Let:

*  'd' be the distance of the journey (what we want to find).
*  'v' be the original uniform speed of the train (<fact1>mentioned in the question</fact1>).
*  't' be the scheduled time.

We can write the distance in terms of speed and time: d = v * t

From the problem, we can form two equations:

* **Equation 1 (Faster Speed):**  d = (v + <fact2>6</fact2>) * (t - <fact3>8</fact3>)  The distance remains the same, but the speed is increased by <fact2>6 km/hr</fact2>, and the time is reduced by <fact3>8 hours</fact3>.
* **Equation 2 (Slower Speed):** d = (v - <fact4>6</fact4>) * (t + <fact5>12</fact5>)  The distance remains the same, but the speed is reduced by <fact4>6 km/hr</fact4>, and the time is increased by <fact5>12 hours</fact5>.


Now we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:

1. d = vt
2. d = (v + 6)(t - 8)
3. d = (v - 6)(t + 12)


We can solve for d.  Expanding equations 2 and 3:

2. d = vt - 8v + 6t - 48
3. d = vt + 12v - 6t - 72

Since d = vt, we can simplify equations 2 and 3:

2. vt = vt - 8v + 6t - 48  =>  8v - 6t = -48 => 4v - 3t = -24
3. vt = vt + 12v - 6t - 72  => 12v - 6t = 72 => 2v - t = 12  => t = 2v - 12


Substitute the expression for 't' from equation 3 into the simplified equation 2:

4v - 3(2v - 12) = -24
4v - 6v + 36 = -24
-2v = -60
v = 30 km/hr

Now substitute v = 30 back into the expression for t:

t = 2(30) - 12
t = 60 - 12
t = 48 hours

Finally, substitute v and t back into the equation for d (<question>the length of the journey</question>):

d = vt
d = 30 * 48
d = 1440 km

The length of the journey is 1440 km.

1439,"The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for $3800. Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

The coach of a cricket team buys <fact1>7 bats</fact1> and <fact2>6 balls</fact2> for <fact3>$3800</fact3>. Later, he buys <fact4>3 bats</fact4> and <fact5>5 balls</fact5> for <fact6>$1750</fact6>. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.

Let 'x' be the cost of each bat and 'y' be the cost of each ball.

From the given information, we can form two equations:

<fact1>7</fact1>x + <fact2>6</fact2>y = <fact3>3800</fact3>  --- (1)
<fact4>3</fact4>x + <fact5>5</fact5>y = <fact6>1750</fact6>  --- (2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously using either substitution or elimination method. Here's the elimination method:

Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 7:

21x + 18y = 11400 --- (3)
21x + 35y = 12250 --- (4)

Subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

17y = 850
y = 850 / 17
y = 50

Substitute y = 50 into equation (2):

3x + 5 * 50 = 1750
3x + 250 = 1750
3x = 1500
x = 500

Therefore, the cost of each bat is $500 and the cost of each ball is $50.

1441,"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.","**Reformatted Question:**

The sum of the digits of a <fact1>two-digit number</fact1> is <fact2>9</fact2>. Also, <fact3>nine times this number</fact3> is <fact4>twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits</fact4>. Find the number.


**Answer:**

Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively.

From the first statement, ""The sum of the digits of a <fact1>two-digit number</fact1> is <fact2>9</fact2>,"" we can write the equation:

a + b = <fact2>9</fact2>

From the second statement, ""<fact3>nine times this number</fact3> is <fact4>twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits</fact4>,"" we can write the equation:

<fact3>9</fact3> * (10a + b) = <fact4>2</fact4> * (10b + a)

Simplifying the second equation:

90a + 9b = 20b + 2a
88a = 11b
8a = b

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) a + b = 9
2) 8a = b

Substitute the second equation into the first:

a + 8a = 9
9a = 9
a = 1

Now substitute the value of a back into the second equation:

8 * 1 = b
b = 8

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10a + b = 10(1) + 8 = 18.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{18}$

1444,"A person invested some amount at 12% simple interest and some amount at 10% simple interest. He received an annual interest of $130. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?","**Reformatted Question:**

A person invested some amount at <fact1>12% simple interest</fact1> and some amount at <fact2>10% simple interest</fact2>. He received an <fact3>annual interest of $130</fact3>. But, if he had interchanged the amounts and invested, he would have received <fact4>$4 more</fact4>. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?


**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the amount invested at <fact1>12%</fact1> and 'y' be the amount invested at <fact2>10%</fact2>.

From the given information, we can form two equations:

Equation 1 (based on <fact3>the annual interest of $130</fact3>):
0.12x + 0.10y = 130

Equation 2 (based on interchanging the amounts and receiving <fact4>$4 more</fact4>, which means $134):
0.10x + 0.12y = 134

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. Here's the solution using elimination:

Multiply Equation 1 by 10 and Equation 2 by 12 to eliminate 'x':

1.2x + y = 1300
1.2x + 1.44y = 1608

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

0.44y = 308

y = 308 / 0.44 = 700

Now substitute the value of y back into Equation 1:

0.12x + 0.10 * 700 = 130
0.12x + 70 = 130
0.12x = 60
x = 60 / 0.12 = 500

Therefore, he invested $500 at <fact1>12%</fact1> and $700 at <fact2>10%</fact2>.

1445,At present a father is three times as old as his son. After 12 years his age will be twice the age of his son. Find their present ages?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

At present a father is <fact1>three times as old as his son</fact1>. After <fact2>12 years</fact2> his age will be <fact3>twice the age of his son</fact3>. Find their present ages?

Let's represent the son's present age as 'x'.
<fact1>The father's present age is three times the son's age</fact1>, so the father's present age is 3x.

After <fact2>12 years</fact2>:
The son's age will be x + <fact2>12</fact2>.
The father's age will be 3x + <fact2>12</fact2>.

According to the problem, after <fact2>12 years</fact2>, the father's age will be <fact3>twice the son's age</fact3>. So, we can write the equation:
3x + <fact2>12</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3>(x + <fact2>12</fact2>)

Solving for x:
3x + <fact2>12</fact2> = 2x + 24
3x - 2x = 24 - <fact2>12</fact2>
x = 12

So, the son's present age is 12 years.
The father's present age is 3 * 12 = 36 years.

Therefore, the son's present age is 12 years and the father's present age is 36 years.

1446,The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.,"**Reformatted Question:** The larger of two <fact1>supplementary angles</fact1> <fact2>exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees</fact2>. Find them.


**Answer:**

Let the smaller angle be x.
Since the angles are <fact1>supplementary</fact1>, their sum is 180 degrees.
The larger angle is x + <fact2>18</fact2> (because it <fact2>exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees</fact2>).

So, we can set up an equation:
x + (x + 18) = 180

Combining like terms:
2x + 18 = 180

Subtracting 18 from both sides:
2x = 162

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 81

So, the smaller angle is 81 degrees.  The larger angle is 81 + <fact2>18</fact2> = 99 degrees.

The two angles are 81 degrees and 99 degrees.

The area of a rectangle gets reduced by <fact1>9 square units</fact1>, if its length is reduced by <fact2>5 units</fact2> and breadth is increased by <fact3>3 units</fact3>. If we increase the length by <fact4>3 units</fact4> and the breadth by <fact5>2 units</fact5>, the area increases by <fact6>67 square units</fact6>. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.


**Answer:**

Let the original length of the rectangle be 'l' units and the original breadth be 'b' units.

The original area of the rectangle is lb square units.

According to the first condition, if the length is reduced by <fact2>5 units</fact2> and the breadth is increased by <fact3>3 units</fact3>, the area is reduced by <fact1>9 square units</fact1>.  This can be written as:

(l - <fact2>5</fact2>)(b + <fact3>3</fact3>) = lb - <fact1>9</fact1>
lb + 3l - 5b - 15 = lb - <fact1>9</fact1>
3l - 5b = 6  --- (Equation 1)


According to the second condition, if the length is increased by <fact4>3 units</fact4> and the breadth is increased by <fact5>2 units</fact5>, the area increases by <fact6>67 square units</fact6>. This can be written as:

(l + <fact4>3</fact4>)(b + <fact5>2</fact5>) = lb + <fact6>67</fact6>
lb + 2l + 3b + 6 = lb + <fact6>67</fact6>
2l + 3b = 61 --- (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations with two variables:

3l - 5b = 6
2l + 3b = 61

We can solve this system of equations. Multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 3:

6l - 10b = 12
6l + 9b = 183

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

19b = 171
b = 9

Substitute b = 9 into Equation 1:

3l - 5(9) = 6
3l - 45 = 6
3l = 51
l = 17

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 17 units and the breadth is 9 units.

In a 2-digit number, the <fact1>tens digit</fact1> is <fact2>4 times</fact2> the <fact3>units digit</fact3>. When <fact4>the digits are reversed</fact4>, the <fact5>new number formed</fact5> is <fact6>54 less than</fact6> the <fact7>original number</fact7>. Find the <fact8>original number</fact8>.

                    Answer:
Let the units digit be represented by 'u' and the tens digit be represented by 't'.

From the first statement, ""<fact1>tens digit</fact1> is <fact2>4 times</fact2> the <fact3>units digit</fact3>"", we can write the equation:
t = 4u

The <fact7>original number</fact7> can be expressed as 10t + u.  When <fact4>the digits are reversed</fact4>, the <fact5>new number</fact5> is 10u + t.

The second statement, ""<fact5>new number formed</fact5> is <fact6>54 less than</fact6> the <fact7>original number</fact7>"", gives us the equation:
10u + t = 10t + u - 54

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) t = 4u
2) 10u + t = 10t + u - 54

Substitute the first equation (t = 4u) into the second equation:
10u + 4u = 10(4u) + u - 54
14u = 40u + u - 54
14u = 41u - 54
54 = 27u
u = 2

Now that we have the units digit (u=2), we can find the tens digit using the first equation:
t = 4u
t = 4 * 2
t = 8

Therefore, the <fact8>original number</fact8> is 10t + u = 10*8 + 2 = 82.

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be Ajith's current age.
Since Anil is <fact1>9 years older</fact1> than Ajith, Anil's current age is x + 9.

In <fact2>10 years</fact2>, Anil's age will be (x + 9) + 10 = x + 19.

<fact4>10 years ago</fact4>, Ajith's age was x - 10.

According to the problem, in <fact2>10 years</fact2>, Anil will be <fact3>twice as old</fact3> as Ajith was <fact4>10 years ago</fact4>.  Therefore:

x + 19 = 2(x - 10)

Solving for x:

x + 19 = 2x - 20
39 = x

So, Ajith's <fact5>present age</fact5> is 39 years old.

Since Anil is <fact1>9 years older</fact1>, Anil's <fact5>present age</fact5> is 39 + 9 = 48 years old.

If <fact1>28 less than five times</fact1> a <fact2>certain number</fact2> is <fact3>232</fact3>. What is <fact2>the number</fact2>?

Let the certain number be represented by 'x'.

""28 less than five times a certain number"" can be represented as 5x - 28.
The question states that this expression is equal to 232:
5x - 28 = <fact3>232</fact3>

Now, solve for x:

Add 28 to both sides of the equation:
5x = <fact3>232</fact3> + 28
5x = 260

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 260 / 5
x = 52

Therefore, the certain number is 52.

**Answer:**

Let's represent the first angle as 'x'.

According to the problem, the second angle is <fact1>double the first</fact1>, so it can be represented as 2x.

The third angle is <fact2>40 less than the first</fact2>, so it can be represented as x - 40.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180

Combining like terms:

4x - 40 = 180

Adding 40 to both sides:

4x = 220

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 55

So, the first angle is 55 degrees.

The second angle is 2 * 55 = 110 degrees.

The third angle is 55 - 40 = 15 degrees.

Therefore, the three angles are 55, 110, and 15 degrees.

Let 'x' be the cost of the <fact4>love seat</fact4>.
The <fact2>sofa</fact2> costs <fact3>double</fact3> the <fact4>love seat</fact4>, so the sofa costs 2x.

The total cost of the <fact2>sofa</fact2> and <fact4>love seat</fact4> is <fact1>$444</fact1>.
So, x + 2x = <fact1>444</fact1>

A horse and a saddle cost <fact1>$5000</fact1>. If the horse cost <fact2>4 times</fact2> as much as the saddle, what was the cost of each?

Let 'x' be the cost of the saddle.
The horse costs <fact2>4 times</fact2> as much as the saddle, so the horse costs 4x.
The total cost of the horse and saddle is <fact1>$5000</fact1>.
Therefore, x + 4x = <fact1>5000</fact1>.

Combining like terms gives:
5x = <fact1>5000</fact1>

Dividing both sides by 5:
x = 1000

So, the saddle cost $1000.
The horse cost 4 * $1000 = $4000.

The cost of the saddle is $1000 and the cost of the horse is $4000.

A bicycle and a bicycle helmet cost <fact1>$240</fact1>. How much did each cost, if the bicycle cost <fact2>5 times</fact2> as much as the helmet?

Let the cost of the helmet be represented by 'x'.
According to the problem, the bicycle costs <fact2>5 times</fact2> as much as the helmet, so the bicycle costs <fact2>5</fact2>x.

The total cost of the bicycle and the helmet is <fact1>$240</fact1>. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 5x = <fact1>240</fact1>

Combining like terms:

6x = <fact1>240</fact1>

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = <fact1>240</fact1> / 6
x = 40

So the helmet cost $40.

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 2 = 30

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

2x = 28

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 14

So, the shorter piece is 14 ft long. Since the other piece is <fact3>2 ft longer</fact3>, its length is 14 + 2 = 16 ft.

Therefore, the two pieces are 14 ft and 16 ft long.

* <fact3>Plus 4 times itself</fact3> adds another 4x, for a total of 4x + 4x = 8x.

The question states that this sum is equal to <fact4>104</fact4>.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

8x = 104

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 104 / 8
x = 13

Therefore, the number is {13}.

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"**Reformatted Question:** Two angles of a triangle are the same size. <fact1>The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle</fact1>. Find the measure the angles.


**Answer:**

Let's denote the measure of the two equal angles as 'x'.  Since <fact1>the third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle</fact1>, its measure is x - 12.

We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x - 12 = 180

Adding 12 to both sides:

3x = 192

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 64

So, the two equal angles measure 64 degrees each. The third angle measures x - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 64 degrees, 64 degrees, and 52 degrees.

**Answer:** Let's represent the size of the two equal angles as 'x'.  According to <fact1>the problem, the third angle is 3 times as large as the first</fact1>, meaning the third angle is 3x.  We know that the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x + 3x = 180. Simplifying, we get 5x = 180.  Dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 36 degrees.  So, the two equal angles are each 36 degrees.  The third angle is 3 * 36 = 108 degrees. Therefore, in response to <fact2>the question</fact2>, the angles are 36, 36, and 108 degrees.

Find <question>the measure of the angles</question>.

**Answer:**

Let's denote the first angle as 'x'.
According to the problem, the third angle is <fact1>the same size as the first</fact1>.  Therefore, the third angle is also 'x'.
The second angle is <fact2>4 times the third</fact2>, which means it's 4 * x = 4x.

We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 4x + x = 180

Combining like terms:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 30

So, the first angle is 30 degrees, the third angle is also 30 degrees (since it's <fact1>the same as the first</fact1>), and the second angle is 4 * 30 = 120 degrees (since it's <fact2>4 times the third</fact2>).

How large are the angles?,"**Reformatted Question:** The second angle of a triangle is <fact1>five times</fact1> as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is <fact2>12 degrees greater</fact2> than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?

**Answer:**

Let's represent the first angle as 'x'.

According to the problem, the second angle is <fact1>five times</fact1> the first angle.  So, the second angle is 5x.

The third angle is <fact2>12 degrees greater</fact2> than the first angle. So, the third angle is x + 12.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 5x + x + 12 = 180

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 180

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 24

Now that we know the first angle (x = 24 degrees), we can find the other two angles:

Second angle: 5 * 24 = 120 degrees
Third angle: 24 + 12 = 36 degrees

Therefore, the angles are 24 degrees, 120 degrees, and 36 degrees.

The second angle of a triangle is <fact1>three times the first</fact1>, and the third is <fact2>12 degrees less than twice the first</fact2>. Find the measures of the angles.

Answer:
Let the first angle be x.
The second angle is <fact1>3x</fact1>.
The third angle is <fact2>2x - 12</fact2>.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:
x + 3x + 2x - 12 = 180
6x - 12 = 180
6x = 192
x = 32

Therefore, the first angle is 32 degrees.
The second angle is 3 * 32 = 96 degrees.
The third angle is 2 * 32 - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

The measures of the angles are 32, 96, and 52 degrees.

The perimeter of a rectangle is <fact1>150 cm</fact1>. The <fact2>length</fact2> is <fact3>15 cm greater than the width</fact3>. Find the dimensions.

                    Answer:
Let the width of the rectangle be 'w' cm.
The <fact2>length</fact2> is <fact3>15 cm greater than the width</fact3>, so the length is w + <fact3>15</fact3> cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

We are given that the perimeter is <fact1>150 cm</fact1>.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

<fact1>150</fact1> = 2( (w + <fact3>15</fact3>) + w)

Simplifying the equation:

<fact1>150</fact1> = 2(2w + <fact3>15</fact3>)
<fact1>150</fact1> = 4w + 30
<fact1>150</fact1> - 30 = 4w
120 = 4w
w = 120/4
w = 30

So, the width is 30 cm.

The <fact2>length</fact2> is w + <fact3>15</fact3>, so the length is 30 + <fact3>15</fact3> = 45 cm.

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 45 cm by 30 cm.  {45, 30}

The perimeter of a college basketball court is <fact1>96 meters</fact1> and the length is <fact2>14 meters more than the width</fact2>. What are the dimensions?

                    Answer:
Let's represent the width of the court as 'w' meters.
According to the problem, the length is <fact2>14 meters more than the width</fact2>. So, the length can be represented as 'w + 14' meters.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width).
We are given that the perimeter is <fact1>96 meters</fact1>. Therefore, we can write the equation:

<fact1>96</fact1> = 2( (w + 14) + w )

Simplifying the equation:

<fact1>96</fact1> = 2(2w + 14)
<fact1>96</fact1> = 4w + 28
<fact1>96</fact1> - 28 = 4w
68 = 4w
w = 68 / 4
w = 17

So, the width of the court is 17 meters.
The length is w + <fact2>14</fact2> = 17 + <fact2>14</fact2> = 31 meters.

Therefore, the dimensions of the college basketball court are 17 meters by 31 meters.  The answer is {17, 31}.

A mountain cabin on 1 acre of land costs <fact1>$30,000</fact1>. If the <fact2>land cost 4 times as much as the cabin</fact2>, what was the cost of each?

Let C be the cost of the cabin and L be the cost of the land.
From ""<fact1>A mountain cabin on 1 acre of land costs $30,000</fact1>"", we know that
C + L = <fact1>$30,000</fact1>

From ""<fact2>If the land cost 4 times as much as the cabin</fact2>"", we know that
L = 4 * C

Now, we substitute L = 4C into the first equation:
C + 4C = <fact1>30000</fact1>
5C = <fact1>30000</fact1>
C = <fact1>30000</fact1>/5
C = 6000

From <fact1>""The width is twice its length""</fact1>, we can write the equation:
W = 2L

From <fact2>""The perimeter of the lot is 60 feet""</fact2>, we know the perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(L + W).  So we can write:
2(L + W) = 60

Now substitute W = 2L into the perimeter equation:
2(L + 2L) = 60
2(3L) = 60
6L = 60
L = 60 / 6
L = 10 feet

Now, substitute L = 10 back into the equation W = 2L:
W = 2 * 10
W = 20 feet

So, the length of the lot is 10 feet and the width is 20 feet.
The answer is {Length: 10, Width: 20}.

What <fact3>is the area</fact3> of the garden?

**Answer:**

The distance around the garden, or the perimeter of the rectangle, <fact1>is 36 feet</fact1>.  A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. Let 'x' be the length of the unknown side. We know that one side is <fact2>10 feet</fact2>, so the other parallel side is also <fact2>10 feet</fact2>.  The perimeter is calculated by adding all sides, so we have 10 + 10 + x + x = 36, or 2x + 20 = 36.

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 8 feet. Therefore, the other side of the rectangle is 8 feet.

<fact3>The area</fact3> of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.  In this case, it is 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.

Therefore, the area of the garden is {80}.

How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?,"**Reformatted Question:** Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures <fact1>6 feet</fact1> by <fact2>10 feet</fact2>. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are <fact3>6 inches</fact3>. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?

**Answer:**

First, we need to convert the dimensions of the bathroom and the tiles to the same unit. Since the tile sides are given in inches, let's convert the bathroom dimensions to inches.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so the bathroom measures (<fact1>6</fact1> feet * 12 inches/foot) by (<fact2>10</fact2> feet * 12 inches/foot), which is 72 inches by 120 inches.

The area of the bathroom floor is 72 inches * 120 inches = 8640 square inches.

Each tile has an area of (<fact3>6</fact3> inches) * (<fact3>6</fact3> inches) = 36 square inches.

To find the number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the bathroom floor by the area of each tile: 8640 square inches / 36 square inches/tile = 240 tiles.

Therefore, Mrs. Garvey will need 240 tiles.  The answer is {240}.

The perimeter of a <fact2>rectangle</fact2> is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.  Since a <fact2>rectangle</fact2> has two pairs of equal length sides, the formula for the perimeter is 2 * (<fact3>length</fact3> + <fact5>width</fact5>).

We know the total amount of fencing used is <fact1>80 meters</fact1>, and this represents the perimeter of the <fact2>rectangular garden</fact2>. We also know the <fact3>length</fact3> is <fact4>25 meters</fact4>.

We can set up an equation:

<fact1>80</fact1> = 2 * (<fact4>25</fact4> + <fact5>width</fact5>)

Dividing both sides by 2:

40 = 25 + <fact5>width</fact5>

A pond inside the garden has an area of <fact2>20 square meters</fact2>. What is the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond?

**Answer:**

The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4. Since the garden's perimeter is <fact1>48 meters</fact1>, the length of one side of the square garden is <fact1>48 meters</fact1> / 4 = 12 meters.

The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself.  Therefore, the area of the square garden is 12 meters * 12 meters = 144 square meters.

The pond within the garden has an area of <fact2>20 square meters</fact2>.

The area of the garden not taken up by the pond is the total area of the garden minus the area of the pond: 144 square meters - <fact2>20 square meters</fact2> = 124 square meters.

Therefore, the answer is {124}.

The <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> is equal to the <fact4>perimeter of the rectangle</fact4>. What is the <fact5>area of the rectangle</fact5>?

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the square:** A square has four equal sides, so its perimeter is 4 * side length.  In this case, the perimeter is 4 * <fact1>15 cm</fact1> = 60 cm.

2. **Determine the width of the rectangle:**  Since the <fact3>perimeter of the square</fact3> (60 cm) is equal to the <fact4>perimeter of the rectangle</fact4>, we know the rectangle's perimeter is also 60 cm.  The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). We know the length is <fact2>18 cm</fact2>, so we can set up the equation: 60 cm = 2 * (<fact2>18 cm</fact2> + width).  Solving for width, we get:
   * 30 cm = 18 cm + width
   * width = 30 cm - 18 cm
   * width = 12 cm

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:** The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width. In this case, the area is <fact2>18 cm</fact2> * 12 cm = 216 cm².

What is the length of the shortest side?


**Answer:**

The ratio of the sides is <fact2>5:12:13</fact2>. This means that the sides can be represented as 5x, 12x, and 13x for some value of x.

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of its sides.  Therefore, 5x + 12x + 13x = <fact1>90 cm</fact1>.

Combining like terms gives 30x = <fact1>90</fact1>.

Dividing both sides by 30 gives x = <fact1>90</fact1>/30 = 3.

The shortest side is 5x. Substituting x = 3, we get 5 * 3 = 15 cm.

Therefore, the length of the shortest side is 15 cm.

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:** The area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width.  In this case, the length is <fact2>6 cm</fact2> and the width is <fact3>4 cm</fact3>, so the area of the rectangle is <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 24 cm².

2. **Use the ratio to find the area of the triangle:** The ratio of the rectangle's area to the triangle's area is <fact1>2:5</fact1>. This means that for every 2 units of area in the rectangle, there are 5 units of area in the triangle. We know the rectangle's area is 24 cm², which represents 2 parts of the ratio.  To find the value of one part of the ratio, we divide the rectangle's area by 2: 24 / 2 = 12 cm².  Since the triangle's area represents 5 parts of the ratio, we multiply the value of one part by 5: 12 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 60 cm².

Therefore, the area of the triangle is 60 cm².  The answer is {60}.

Megan had <fact1>five hundred sixteen pennies</fact1>. She wanted to place the pennies into <fact2>nine stacks</fact2>, with the same amount in each stack. How many more pennies would she need so all the stacks would be equal?


**Answer:**

Megan has <fact1>516 pennies</fact1> and wants to divide them into <fact2>9 equal stacks</fact2>.

First, we find out how many pennies would be in each stack if she divided the pennies she had equally: 516 / <fact2>9</fact2> = 57 remainder 3.

This means each stack would have 57 pennies, and there would be 3 left over.

To make all the stacks equal, each stack would need to have 57 + 1 = 58 pennies.  Since there are <fact2>9 stacks</fact2>, she would need <fact2>9</fact2> * 58 = 522 pennies.

Since she already has <fact1>516 pennies</fact1>, she needs 522 - <fact1>516</fact1> = 6 more pennies.

If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?

**Answer:**

The store owner wants to divide the <fact2>583 uniforms</fact2> equally among his <fact1>six employees</fact1>.  583 divided by 6 is 97 with a remainder of 1. This means each employee would receive 97 uniforms, and there would be 1 extra uniform.  Since the owner wants no extra uniforms, he needs to buy enough more so that the total number of uniforms is evenly divisible by <fact1>6</fact1>.  Since he has 1 extra uniform currently, he needs to buy 6 - 1 = 5 more uniforms. The answer is {5}.

She wanted to put them into <fact2>eight</fact2> bouquets with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?

**Answer:**

The botanist picked <fact1>601</fact1> flowers and wants to divide them equally into <fact2>8</fact2> bouquets.  To find out how many flowers would be in each bouquet if she divided them equally, we can divide 601 by 8:

601 / 8 = 75 with a remainder of 1.

This means each of the <fact2>8</fact2> bouquets would have 75 flowers, and there would be 1 flower left over. Since she doesn't want any extra flowers, she needs to pick enough additional flowers so that the total number of flowers is divisible by <fact2>8</fact2>.  Since she already has a remainder of 1, she needs to pick 7 more flowers (8 - 1 = 7) to reach the next multiple of 8.

Therefore, she should pick 7 more flowers. The answer is {7}.

At the store he bought <fact3>three hundred seventy-nine pieces</fact3> total to give to them. How many more pieces should he have bought so he didn't have any extra?

**Answer:**

Victor has <fact3>379</fact3> pieces of candy and wants to divide them equally among his <fact1>six</fact1> friends.  To find out how many pieces each friend receives, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends: 379 / <fact1>6</fact1> = 63 with a remainder of 1. This means each friend would get 63 pieces, and there would be 1 piece left over.

Since Victor wants to give an <fact2>equal amount</fact2> with no leftovers, he needs to buy enough more candy so the total is evenly divisible by <fact1>6</fact1>. The next multiple of 6 after 379 is 384 (64 x <fact1>6</fact1> = 384).

Therefore, Victor should have bought 384 - <fact3>379</fact3> = 5 more pieces of candy. The answer is {5}.

A movie store had <fact1>nine hundred ninety-nine</fact1> movies they were putting on <fact2>five</fact2> shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?

                    Answer:                         
We divide the <fact1>999 movies</fact1> by the <fact2>5 shelves</fact2>: 999 / 5 = 199 with a remainder of 4. This means if the owner wants the same number of movies on each shelf, each shelf would have 199 movies. However, since there are 5 shelves, the total number of movies would need to be 199 * 5 = 995. The owner therefore needs 999 (current number of movies) + (5 - 4) = 1000 movies, or 1 more movie to have 200 movies per shelf. Another way to calculate the number of movies needed is by identifying the remainder when dividing <fact1>999</fact1> by <fact2>5</fact2>. The remainder is 4. To make the number divisible by <fact2>5</fact2>, we need <fact2>5</fact2> - 4 = 1 more movie.  The answer is {1}.

A school had <fact1>nine hundred thirty-five</fact1> students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have <fact2>six</fact2> team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

First, we divide the <fact1>total number of students</fact1> by the <fact2>desired number of teams</fact2>: 935 / <fact2>6</fact2> = 155 with a remainder of 5. This means that each of the <fact2>six teams</fact2> would have 155 students, and there would be 5 students left over. Since the question asks how many *more* students would need to sign up to have equal teams, we need to determine how many more students are needed to reach the next multiple of <fact2>6</fact2>. Since 155 * <fact2>6</fact2> = 930 and 156 * <fact2>6</fact2> = 936, we need one more student to make six teams of 156.  Therefore, they would need 1 more student to sign up.

If the ratio of <fact2>empty spaces</fact2> to <fact3>taken spaces</fact3> is <fact4>5:4</fact4>, how many spaces are there total?

**Answer:**
The ratio of <fact2>empty spaces</fact2> to <fact3>taken spaces</fact3> is <fact4>5:4</fact4>. This means that for every 5 empty spaces, there are 4 taken spaces.

We are given that there are <fact1>35 empty spaces</fact1>.  Since the ratio of empty spaces to the ratio value is 35:5, we can find how many times larger the actual number of empty spaces is than the ratio by dividing <fact1>35</fact1> by <fact4>5</fact4>.  35 / 5 = 7.  This tells us the actual number of spaces is 7 times the values in the ratio.

To find the number of <fact3>taken spaces</fact3>, we multiply the ratio value for taken spaces (<fact4>4</fact4>) by 7: 4 * 7 = 28 taken spaces.

The total number of spaces is the sum of <fact2>empty spaces</fact2> and <fact3>taken spaces</fact3>: <fact1>35</fact1> + 28 = 63 spaces.

If the ratio of siamese cats to house cats sold was 2:1, what is the combined amount of cats sold?","**Reformatted Question:** A pet store sold <fact1>12 siamese cats</fact1>. If the ratio of <fact2>siamese cats</fact2> to <fact3>house cats</fact3> sold was <fact4>2:1</fact4>, what is the combined amount of cats sold?

**Answer:**
The ratio of siamese cats to house cats is <fact4>2:1</fact4>.  This means for every 2 siamese cats sold, 1 house cat was sold.  Since <fact1>12 siamese cats</fact1> were sold, this represents 12/<fact4>2</fact4> = 6 ""sets"" of the 2:1 ratio.  Therefore, 6 * <fact4>1</fact4> = 6 house cats were sold.

The total number of cats sold is the sum of siamese cats and house cats, which is <fact1>12</fact1> + 6 = 18 cats. The answer is {18}.

1690,"A cafeteria sold 49 cartons of regular flavored milk. If the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold was 7:2, what is the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

A cafeteria sold <fact1>49 cartons</fact1> of <fact2>regular</fact2> flavored milk. If the ratio of <fact2>regular milk</fact2> sold to <fact3>chocolate milk</fact3> sold was <fact4>7:2</fact4>, what is the combined amount of <fact3>chocolate</fact3> and <fact2>regular milk</fact2> sold?

The cafeteria sold <fact1>49 cartons</fact1> of <fact2>regular milk</fact2>.  The ratio of <fact2>regular</fact2> to <fact3>chocolate</fact3> milk sold is <fact4>7:2</fact4>. This means that for every 7 cartons of <fact2>regular milk</fact2> sold, 2 cartons of <fact3>chocolate milk</fact3> were sold.

Since <fact1>49</fact1> cartons of <fact2>regular milk</fact2> were sold, we can find how many ""sets"" of 7 were sold by dividing: <fact1>49</fact1> / <fact4>7</fact4> = 7.

This means 7 ""sets"" of the <fact4>7:2</fact4> ratio were sold. Therefore, the number of <fact3>chocolate milk</fact3> cartons sold is 7 * <fact4>2</fact4> = 14.

The combined amount of <fact3>chocolate</fact3> and <fact2>regular milk</fact2> sold is <fact1>49</fact1> + 14 = 63 cartons.

The answer is {63}.

1692,"At an ice cream shop the ratio of sugar cones sold to waffle cones sold is 5:4. If there are 45 sugar cones sold, how many waffles cones would be sold?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

At an ice cream shop the ratio of <fact1>sugar cones</fact1> sold to <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> sold is <fact3>5:4</fact3>. If there are <fact4>45 sugar cones</fact4> sold, how many <fact2>waffles cones</fact2> would be sold?

The ratio of <fact1>sugar cones</fact1> to <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> is <fact3>5:4</fact3>. This means for every 5 <fact1>sugar cones</fact1> sold, 4 <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> are sold.  Since <fact4>45 sugar cones</fact4> were sold, that's <fact4>45</fact4>/<fact3>5</fact3> = 9 times the original ratio.

Therefore, the number of <fact2>waffle cones</fact2> sold would be <fact3>4</fact3> * 9 = 36.  

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{36}$

She wants each classroom to receive an identical set of campaign materials, without having any materials left over. What is the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to?

**Answer:** This question is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of flyers (<fact1>20</fact1>) and buttons (<fact2>16</fact2>).  We need to find the largest number that divides both 20 and 16 evenly.

The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.
The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

The common factors of 20 and 16 are 1, 2, and 4. The greatest of these common factors is 4.

                    Answer:                        This question is asking for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of granola bars (<fact1>6</fact1>) and the number of pieces of dried fruit (<fact2>10</fact2>) that Serena has.  Since the <fact3>snack bags need to be identical</fact3>, we need to divide the granola bars and dried fruit evenly among the bags. We want the *greatest* number of bags, so we need the largest number that divides both 6 and 10 evenly.

The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

The common factors of 6 and 10 are 1 and 2.  The greatest of these is 2.  Therefore, Serena can make at most 2 snack bags.

Each bag will contain 6/2 = 3 granola bars and 10/2 = 5 pieces of dried fruit. Since all the granola bars and dried fruit are used, and each bag has the same contents, the answer is {2}.

The president wants to break the club into groups, with each group containing the same combination of girls and boys. The president also wants to make sure that <fact3>no one is left out</fact3>. What is the <question>greatest number of groups</question> the president can make?

**Answer:**

To find the greatest number of groups the president can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls (<fact1>16</fact1>) and the number of boys (<fact2>8</fact2>). This is because each group must have the same combination of girls and boys, and no one can be left out (<fact3>no one is left out</fact3>).

The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.
The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

The GCD of 16 and 8 is 8.  Therefore, the president can make a maximum of 8 groups.  Each group will contain 16/8 = 2 girls and 8/8 = 1 boy.  This ensures that all members are included and each group has the same composition. The answer to the <question>greatest number of groups</question> is {8}.

If Ariel wants to make all the arrangements <constraint1>identical</constraint1> and have <constraint2>no flowers left over</constraint2>, what is the <question>greatest number of flower arrangements</question> that he can make?

**Answer:** To find the greatest number of identical arrangements with no flowers left over, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of roses (<fact1>7</fact1>) and daisies (<fact2>14</fact2>).  The factors of <fact1>7</fact1> are 1 and 7. The factors of <fact2>14</fact2> are 1, 2, 7, and 14. The greatest common factor is 7. Therefore, Ariel can make a maximum of 7 identical arrangements (<question>greatest number of flower arrangements</question>), given the <constraint1>identical</constraint1> and <constraint2>no flowers left over</constraint2> constraints.  Each arrangement would have <fact1>7</fact1>/7 = 1 rose and <fact2>14</fact2>/7 = 2 daisies. The answer is {7}.

                    Answer:                             
We are looking for the least common multiple of the number of packages each company’s trucks carry. Sarah's trucks carry <fact2>18</fact2> packages and Ryan's trucks carry <fact4>11</fact4>. Since 18 and 11 share no common factors other than 1 (they are relatively prime), their least common multiple is simply their product.  18 * 11 = 198. Thus, the minimum number of packages each company shipped is 198.  The answer is {198}.

**Answer:**

This problem is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of rolls of toilet paper (<fact1>18</fact1>) and the number of bars of soap (<fact2>9</fact2>).  Because of the requirements that the bathrooms be stocked <fact3>identically</fact3> (<fact4>same combination</fact4>) and that there be <fact5>nothing left over</fact5>, we need a number of bathrooms that divides evenly into both 18 and 9.  Since we want the <fact6>greatest</fact6> number of bathrooms, we are looking for the largest number that divides into both.

The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.

The greatest common factor is 9.  Therefore, Nathan can stock a maximum of 9 bathrooms.

What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Aylin is making a scrapbook using <fact1>18 photos</fact1> and <fact2>20 newspaper clippings</fact2>. She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that <fact3>no items are left over</fact3>. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?

Answer:
This question is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of photos (<fact1>18</fact1>) and the number of newspaper clippings (<fact2>20</fact2>).  Since no items can be left over (<fact3>no items are left over</fact3>), we need to find the largest number that divides both 18 and 20 evenly.

The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

The common factors of 18 and 20 are 1 and 2. The greatest of these is 2.

Therefore, Aylin can create a maximum of 2 scrapbook pages.  Each page will have 18/2 = 9 photos and 20/2 = 10 newspaper clippings.

2023,"Hay's Linens sells hand towels in sets of 17 and bath towels in sets of 6. If the store sold the same number of each this morning, what is the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold?","**Reformatted Question:** Hay's Linens sells hand towels in sets of <fact1>17</fact1> and bath towels in sets of <fact2>6</fact2>. If the store sold the same number of each this morning, what is the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold?

**Answer:**  The question asks for the smallest number of each type of towel sold, given they sold the same number of hand towels (sets of <fact1>17</fact1>) and bath towels (sets of <fact2>6</fact2>). This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 6.  Since 17 is a prime number and 6 is not divisible by 17, the LCM is simply <fact1>17</fact1> * <fact2>6</fact2> = 102.  Therefore, the store must have sold 102 of each type of towel. The answer is {102}.

If he wants to <fact3>prepare identical platters</fact3> <fact4>without having any cake left over</fact4>, what is the <fact5>greatest number of platters</fact5> he can prepare?


**Answer:** This question is asking for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of chocolate cake pieces (<fact1>15</fact1>) and the number of cheesecake pieces (<fact2>6</fact2>).  Because of the requirements that the platters be <fact3>identical</fact3> and that there be <fact4>no cake left over</fact4>, we need a number of platters that divides evenly into both 15 and 6. We want the <fact5>greatest</fact5> such number.

The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.
The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

The common factors are 1 and 3. The greatest common factor is 3.  Therefore, Brant can prepare 3 platters. Each platter will have 15/3 = 5 pieces of chocolate cake and 6/3 = 2 pieces of cheesecake.

If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?","**Reformatted Question:** Two bikers are riding a circular path. The first rider completes a round in <fact1>12 minutes</fact1>. The second rider completes a round in <fact2>18 minutes</fact2>. If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?

**Answer:**
This problem involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the two times it takes each biker to complete a round. The first rider takes <fact1>12 minutes</fact1> and the second rider takes <fact2>18 minutes</fact2>.  The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36. This means that after 36 minutes, both bikers will be back at the starting point simultaneously.  Here's why:

* **First biker:** In 36 minutes, the first biker will complete 36 / <fact1>12</fact1> = 3 rounds.
* **Second biker:** In 36 minutes, the second biker will complete 36 / <fact2>18</fact2> = 2 rounds.

Since both bikers will have completed a whole number of rounds in 36 minutes, they will both be back at the starting point at the same time. Therefore, the answer is {36}.

2026,Sean has 8-inch pieces of toy train track and Ruth has 18-inch pieces of train track. How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?,"**Reformatted Question:** Sean has <fact1>8-inch</fact1> pieces of toy train track and Ruth has <fact2>18-inch</fact2> pieces of train track. How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?

**Answer:**

We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two track lengths (<fact1>8 inches</fact1> and <fact2>18 inches</fact2>) to determine the shortest equal length track they can both build.

The prime factorization of 8 is 2 x 2 x 2.
The prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3.

The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number: 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 = 72.

So, the shortest equal length track they can build is 72 inches.

Now, to find how many pieces each child needs:

Sean: 72 inches / <fact1>8 inches/piece</fact1> = 9 pieces.
Ruth: 72 inches / <fact2>18 inches/piece</fact2> = 4 pieces.

Therefore, Sean needs 9 of his <fact1>8-inch pieces</fact1>, and Ruth needs 4 of her <fact2>18-inch pieces</fact2> to build tracks that are equal in length.

The radio station gave away a $100 bill for every <fact1>100th caller</fact1>. Every <fact2>30th caller</fact2> received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a <fact3>coupon and a concert ticket</fact3>?

                    Answer:                             The question mentions a $100 bill, but the prompt mentions a coupon. Let's assume they are the same. To find the number of callers who will receive both, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>100</fact1> and <fact2>30</fact2>.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:
100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
30 = 2 * 3 * 5

Next, we find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization:
LCM(100, 30) = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 300

Therefore, the 300th caller will be the first to receive both a <fact3>$100 bill (coupon) and a concert ticket</fact3>.

The answer is {300}.

When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had <fact3>won the same number of total tickets</fact3>. What is the <question>minimum number of games that Enzo could have played</question>?


                    Answer:
Let 'x' be the number of games Enzo played and 'y' be the number of games Beatriz played.
Enzo wins <fact1>5 tickets per game</fact1>, so he won a total of 5x tickets.
Beatriz wins <fact2>11 tickets per game</fact2>, so she won a total of 11y tickets.
Since they <fact3>won the same number of tickets</fact3>, we have 5x = 11y.
We are looking for the <question>minimum number of games Enzo could have played</question>, which means we are looking for the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the equation.
We can rewrite the equation as x = (11/5)y. Since x must be an integer, y must be a multiple of 5.  Let y = 5. Then x = (11/5)*5 = 11.
So, the minimum number of games Enzo could have played is 11, while Beatriz played 5 games.
The answer is {11}.

What is the <fact3>least number of total pins</fact3> that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the number of bowls Sam bowled and 'y' be the number of bowls Carlos bowled.
We are given that Sam knocks down <fact1>8 pins</fact1> per bowl, and Carlos knocks down <fact2>9 pins</fact2> per bowl.  We are also told they knocked down the <fact3>same total number of pins</fact3>. This can be represented by the equation:

8x = 9y

We want to find the least number of pins they could have each knocked down. This means we are looking for the smallest possible values of x and y that satisfy the equation.  We are looking for the least common multiple of 8 and 9.

We can find this by listing multiples of each:

This question is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chocolate chip cookies (<fact1>86</fact1>) and sugar cookies (<fact2>42</fact2>) since the packages must be identical (<fact3>identical packages</fact3>) and all cookies must be used (<fact4>must use all of the cookies</fact4>).  We're looking for the <fact5>greatest</fact5> number of packages, so we need the GCD.

We can find the GCD using prime factorization:

* 86 = 2 * 43
* 42 = 2 * 3 * 7

The only common prime factor is 2.  Therefore, the greatest common divisor is 2.

Shaquira can make 2 identical packages. Each package will contain 86/2 = 43 chocolate chip cookies and 42/2 = 21 sugar cookies.

The answer is {2}.

There are <fact1>32 forwards</fact1> and <fact2>80 guards</fact2> in Leo's basketball league. Leo must include all players on a team and wants each team to have the same number of forwards and the same number of guards. If Leo creates the <keyphrase>greatest number of teams possible</keyphrase>, how many <keyphrase>guards</keyphrase> will be on each <keyphrase>team</keyphrase>?


**Answer:**

To find the greatest number of teams possible, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of forwards (<fact1>32</fact1>) and the number of guards (<fact2>80</fact2>).

The factors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.
The factors of 80 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 80.

The GCD of 32 and 80 is 16. This means Leo can create a maximum of <keyphrase>16 teams</keyphrase>.

To find the number of <keyphrase>guards</keyphrase> on each <keyphrase>team</keyphrase>, we divide the total number of guards (<fact2>80</fact2>) by the number of teams (16): 80 / 16 = 5.

So, there will be 5 guards on each team.  The answer is {5}.

There are <fact1>72 boys</fact1> and <fact2>90 girls</fact2> on the math team. For the next math competition, Mr. Johnson would like to arrange all of the students in equal rows with <fact3>only girls or only boys</fact3> in each row. What is the <question>greatest number of students that can be in each row</question>?

To find the <question>greatest number of students that can be in each row</question>, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of boys (<fact1>72</fact1>) and the number of girls (<fact2>90</fact2>). This is because the number of students in each row must divide both 72 and 90 evenly, since there will be <fact3>only girls or only boys in each row</fact3>.

The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 90 is 2 * 3^2 * 5.

The common prime factors are 2 and 3^2.  Multiplying these common factors gives us the GCD: 2 * 3^2 = 2 * 9 = 18.

Therefore, the greatest number of students that can be in each row is 18.

She wants to divide the class into teams of the same size, where each team has the same number of girls and the same number of boys. If Rafaela creates the <fact3>greatest number of teams</fact3> possible, how many boys will be on each team?


**Answer:**

To find the greatest number of teams Rafaela can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls (<fact1>25</fact1>) and the number of boys (<fact2>35</fact2>).  The factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The factors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, and 35.  The GCD of 25 and 35 is 5.  This means Rafaela can create <fact3>5 teams</fact3>.

Each of the 5 teams will have the same number of boys. To find how many boys are on each team, we divide the total number of boys (<fact2>35</fact2>) by the number of teams (5): 35 / 5 = 7 boys.

Therefore, each team will have 7 boys. The answer is {7}.

What is the <fact4>greatest number of snack bags</fact4> that Destiny can make?


**Answer:**

To find the greatest number of identical snack bags Destiny can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of chocolate candy bars (<fact1>18</fact1>) and the number of cookies (<fact2>12</fact2>).  This is because the GCD represents the largest number that can divide both quantities evenly, ensuring that each snack bag has the same number of candy bars and cookies and that all items are used.

The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The common factors of 18 and 12 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
The greatest common factor is 6.

Therefore, Destiny can make a maximum of <fact4>6 identical snack bags</fact4>. Each bag will contain <fact1>18</fact1>/6 = 3 chocolate candy bars and <fact2>12</fact2>/6 = 2 cookies.

Luther's Paint Supplies sold equal quantities of two paint colors yesterday: <fact1>yellow</fact1> and <fact2>blue</fact2>. All <fact1>yellow paint</fact1> comes in <fact3>2-liter containers</fact3> while <fact2>blue paint</fact2> is sold in containers of <fact4>19 liter</fact4>. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?


Let Y be the total amount of yellow paint sold and B be the total amount of blue paint sold.  We are given that Y = B.

Since yellow paint is sold in 2-liter containers, the total liters of yellow paint sold must be a multiple of 2. Therefore, Y = 2n, where 'n' represents the number of 2-liter yellow paint containers sold.

Similarly, blue paint is sold in 19-liter containers, meaning the total liters of blue paint sold is a multiple of 19.  Thus, B = 19m, where 'm' is the number of 19-liter blue paint containers sold.

Since Y = B, we have 2n = 19m. We are looking for the smallest positive integers n and m that satisfy this equation.  This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 19. Because 2 and 19 are prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product.

LCM(2, 19) = 2 * 19 = 38

Therefore, 2n = 38 which means n = 19 (19 containers of yellow paint).
And 19m = 38 which means m = 2 (2 containers of blue paint).

The smallest amount of each paint color sold is 38 liters.


Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{38}$

                         Answer:
To find out how many customers received both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of <fact1>75</fact1> and <fact2>30</fact2>.  The prime factorization of 75 is 3 x 5 x 5, and the prime factorization of 30 is 2 x 3 x 5.  The LCM is 2 x 3 x 5 x 5 = 150.  So every 150th customer receives both items.

There were a total of <fact3>3,000 customers</fact3>.  To find out how many people received both items, we divide <fact3>3,000</fact3> by 150: 3000 / 150 = 20.

Therefore, 20 people received both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn. The answer is {20}.

Tim has a bag of <fact1>36 orange-flavoured sweets</fact1> and Peter has a bag of <fact2>44 grape-flavoured sweets</fact2>. They have to divide up the sweets into small trays with <constraint1>equal number of sweets</constraint1>; each tray containing <constraint2>either orange-flavoured or grape-flavoured sweets only</constraint2>. If there is <constraint3>no remainder</constraint3>, what is the <question>largest possible number of sweets</question> in each tray?


**Answer:**

We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of orange-flavoured sweets (<fact1>36</fact1>) and the number of grape-flavoured sweets (<fact2>44</fact2>) because the sweets need to be divided into trays with an equal number (<constraint1>) and without any remainder (<constraint3>).

The factors of <fact1>36</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.
The factors of <fact2>44</fact2> are 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, and 44.

If only <fact3>whole square pieces</fact3> are used, and the board is to be <fact4>completely covered</fact4>, what is the <fact5>largest possible length</fact5> of the side of each square colored paper?


**Answer:**

Since the board must be <fact4>completely covered</fact4> by <fact3>whole square pieces</fact3>, the side length of the squares must be a common divisor of the board's dimensions (<fact1>72 cm</fact1> and <fact2>90 cm</fact2>).  We are looking for the <fact5>largest possible length</fact5>, so we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 90.

The prime factorization of 72 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 (or 2³ x 3²).
The prime factorization of 90 is 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 (or 2 x 3² x 5).

The common prime factors are 2 and 3 x 3.  Therefore, the GCD is 2 x 3 x 3 = 18.

We are looking for the greatest possible length of the pieces that can be cut from two wires of lengths <fact1>448 cm</fact1> and <fact2>616 cm</fact2> such that there is <fact4>no remainder</fact4>. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two lengths.

We can find the GCD of <fact1>448</fact1> and <fact2>616</fact2> by using the prime factorization method.
Prime factorization of 448: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 7 = 2^6 x 7
Prime factorization of 616: 2 x 2 x 2 x 7 x 11 = 2^3 x 7 x 11

The common factors are 2^3 and 7.
GCD(448, 616) = 2^3 x 7 = 8 x 7 = 56

2086,"Three pieces of timber 42 m, 49 m and 63 m long have to be divided into planks of the same length. What is the greatest possible length of each plank?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Three pieces of timber <fact1>42 m</fact1>, <fact2>49 m</fact2> and <fact3>63 m</fact3> long have to be divided into planks of the <fact4>same length</fact4>. What is the <fact5>greatest possible length</fact5> of each plank?

Answer:
We are looking for the greatest possible length of each plank, given that the planks must all be the <fact4>same length</fact4>.  This means we are looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three lengths: <fact1>42</fact1>, <fact2>49</fact2>, and <fact3>63</fact3>.

The prime factors of <fact1>42</fact1> are 2 x 3 x 7.
The prime factors of <fact2>49</fact2> are 7 x 7.
The prime factors of <fact3>63</fact3> are 3 x 3 x 7.

The only common prime factor among all three numbers is 7. Since we are looking for the <fact5>greatest</fact5> common divisor, and 7 appears only once in the factorization of each number, the GCD is 7.

Therefore, the greatest possible length of each plank is 7 m. The answer is {7}.

2087,Fabric is sold in stores from bolts that are 45 or 60 inches wide. What is the width of the widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric if each strip has the same width?,"**Reformatted Question:** Fabric is sold in stores from bolts that are <fact1>45</fact1> or <fact2>60</fact2> inches wide. What is the width of the <fact3>widest</fact3> strips of fabric you can cut from <fact4>either bolt</fact4> <fact5>without wasting any of the fabric</fact5> if <fact6>each strip has the same width</fact6>?

**Answer:**

This question is asking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two bolt widths.  Since we want to cut strips of the same width (<fact6>) from *both* bolt sizes (<fact4>) with no waste (<fact5>), the strip width must divide evenly into both <fact1>45</fact1> and <fact2>60</fact2>. We are looking for the *widest* possible strip (<fact3>), meaning the largest number that divides evenly into both.

The factors of <fact1>45</fact1> are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45.
The factors of <fact2>60</fact2> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

The common factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15.  The greatest of these is 15.

Therefore, the widest strips you can cut are 15 inches wide.  You could cut three 15-inch strips from the <fact1>45-inch</fact1> bolt and four 15-inch strips from the <fact2>60-inch</fact2> bolt, without wasting any fabric.

They have <fact1>72 turkey slices</fact1>, <fact2>48 cheese slices</fact2>, and <fact3>96 tomato slices</fact3>. What is the <question>greatest number of sandwiches</question> they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?


**Answer:** To find the greatest number of sandwiches they can make with the same filling, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of turkey, cheese, and tomato slices.

The factors of <fact1>72</fact1> are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.
The factors of <fact2>48</fact2> are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48.
The factors of <fact3>96</fact3> are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48 and 96.

The common factors of 72, 48, and 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.  The greatest of these is 24.

Therefore, they can make a maximum of <question>24 sandwiches</question>, each containing an equal number of turkey, cheese, and tomato slices.  The answer is {24}.

Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking <fact1>840 miles</fact1> to Boston. The other is biking <fact2>440 miles</fact2> to Atlanta. What is the <question>greatest number of miles a day each can bike</question> if they want to <constraint>cover equal distances each day</constraint>?

                    Answer:                                         We are looking for the greatest number of miles each person can bike per day, such that they both travel the same distance each day. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two distances, <fact1>840 miles</fact1> and <fact2>440 miles</fact2>.  We can find the GCD using the prime factorization method.

The prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7.
The prime factorization of 440 is 2^3 * 5 * 11.

The common prime factors are 2^3 and 5.
Therefore, the GCD is 2^3 * 5 = 8 * 5 = 40.

So the greatest number of miles each can bike per day while covering equal distances is 40 miles. The answer is {40}.

A fruit salad made on a TV cooking program requires chunks of <fact1>cantaloupe</fact1> and <fact2>honeydew</fact2>. What is the <fact3>greatest number of servings</fact3> you can make using all of the fruit if you have <fact4>30 chunks of cantaloupe</fact4> and <fact5>42 chunks of honeydew</fact5>?

                    Answer:                         The question asks for the greatest number of servings of fruit salad that can be made using <fact4>30 chunks of cantaloupe</fact4> and <fact5>42 chunks of honeydew</fact5>.  To find the greatest number of servings, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30 and 42.

The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.
The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.

The common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest common factor is 6.

Therefore, the greatest number of servings that can be made is 6. Each serving will have 30/6 = 5 chunks of <fact1>cantaloupe</fact1> and 42/6 = 7 chunks of <fact2>honeydew</fact2>.


The answer is {6}.

How many arrangements can she make with those flowers so that, there is no flower left.","                    Reformatted Question: Jessica wants of make a garland out of <fact1>8 roses</fact1>, <fact2>12 daisies</fact2> and <fact3>48 marigolds</fact3>. How many arrangements can she make with those flowers so that, there is no flower left?                         Answer:

The total number of flowers Jessica has is <fact1>8</fact1> + <fact2>12</fact2> + <fact3>48</fact3> = 68.  Since a garland is circular, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! where n is the total number of items. However, since there are multiple identical flowers (roses, daisies, marigolds) we need to divide by the factorial of the count of each type of flower.

So, the number of arrangements is (68-1)! / (<fact1>8</fact1>! * <fact2>12</fact2>! * <fact3>48</fact3>!) = 67!/(8! * 12! * 48!).

The answer is {67!/(8! * 12! * 48!)}.

Deborah sold <fact2>31 boxes</fact2>.  Since a full case has <fact1>12 boxes</fact1>, we can divide her total sales by the number of boxes in a case: 31 / <fact1>12</fact1> = 2 with a remainder of 7.

2266,"Sean had 45 Starbursts. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?","**Reformatted Question:** Sean had <fact1>45 Starbursts</fact1>. If Sean gave equal numbers of <fact2>Starbursts</fact2> to his <fact3>18 friends</fact3> and then he ate what was left, how many <fact2>Starbursts</fact2> did each person eat?

**Answer:**
Since Sean is giving the Starbursts to his <fact3>18 friends</fact3>, he can give each friend 45/<fact3>18</fact3> = 2 Starbursts, with a remainder of 9 Starbursts. Sean eats the remaining <fact4>9 Starbursts</fact4>. Therefore, each of Sean's <fact3>18 friends</fact3> ate 2 Starbursts and Sean ate <fact4>9 Starbursts</fact4>. The question asks how many each *person* ate. There are 18 friends + Sean = 19 people.
Since the question asks ""how many Starbursts did each *person* eat?"", it seems to be implying an average. The total number of starbursts eaten is <fact1>45</fact1>. The total number of people who ate starbursts is <fact3>18</fact3> + 1 (Sean) = 19. So, on average, each person ate 45/19 ≈ 2.37 Starbursts.  Since we're dealing with whole Starbursts, we can say some people ate 2 and Sean ate 9.

So depending on how we interpret the question, each *friend* ate 2 Starbursts, or *each person* ate an average of approximately 2.37 Starbursts. Since the question asks how many Starbursts each *person* ate, and assuming we are looking for an average, the answer is approximately {2.37}. If we're going for whole numbers only, the *friends* each ate 2 and Sean ate 9.

How many cases of <fact2>6</fact2> boxes, plus extra boxes does Mary need to deliver?                        Answer:

Mary needs to deliver <fact1>9</fact1> boxes.  Since each case holds <fact2>6</fact2> boxes, she needs <fact1>9</fact1>/<fact2>6</fact2> = 1.5 cases.  Since she can't deliver half a case, she needs 1 full case of <fact2>6</fact2> boxes plus 3 extra boxes (9 - 6 = 3).

**Answer:**

The question states that Betty *ate* <fact2>45</fact2> crackers. It doesn't say how many she *had* initially. Since we only know how many she *consumed*, we don't have enough information to determine how many she has *left*.  Therefore, the answer is **Not enough information**.

Atomic fireballs come in packages of <fact1>9</fact1>. Barbara ate <fact2>59</fact2> Atomic Fireballs. How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?

The question asks how many fireballs Barbara has *left*. This implies she started with some and ate some. The question states she *ate* <fact2>59</fact2> fireballs.  However, the question does *not* say how many she started with, only that they come in packages of <fact1>9</fact1>. This information is irrelevant to how many she has left, because we only know how many she ate. Without knowing how many she started with, we can't determine how many are left.  Since we are asked how many are *left*, and that is assumed to be a non-negative number, she must have started with at least <fact2>59</fact2> atomic fireballs. She currently has <fact2>59</fact2> less than what she started with, but without knowing what she started with we don't know precisely how many she has left.
