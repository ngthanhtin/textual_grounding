**Answer:**
Let's think step by step. We are given the following counts of objects on the floor:
* <fact1>Mauve cat toys</fact1>: 1
* <fact3>Purple cat toys</fact3>: 2
* <fact4>Grey cat toys</fact4>: 3
* <fact1>Mauve notebooks</fact1>: 2
* <fact4>Grey notebooks</fact4>: 3
* <fact6>Burgundy cat toys</fact6>: 3
* <fact3>Purple notebooks</fact3>: 1

The question asks how many <fact4>grey</fact4> objects remain after all the <fact5>notebooks</fact5> are removed. Since there are three <fact4>grey cat toys</fact4> and we are removing the <fact5>notebooks</fact5>, which are separate objects, the number of <fact4>grey</fact4> objects remaining is still three.  Therefore, the answer is {D}.

**Answer:**
The items are arranged in a row: <fact1>green bracelet</fact1>, <fact2>pink textbook</fact2>, <fact3>grey paperclip</fact3>, and <fact4>teal cup</fact4>.  The <fact3>paperclip</fact3> is in the middle. The items furthest from the <fact3>paperclip</fact3> would be at either end of the row. In this case, those items are the <fact1>green bracelet</fact1> and the <fact4>teal cup</fact4>. Since the question asks for the <fact5>color</fact5> of the object <fact6>furthest</fact6> from the <fact3>paperclip</fact3>, and both the bracelet and the cup are equally distant, either would satisfy the condition.

However, by the grammatical construction, ""furthest,"" it seems most reasonable to assume the question refers to the object furthest *away* from the paperclip. Thus, the furthest object is the <fact4>teal cup</fact4>. Therefore, the answer is {J}.

**Answer:**

Let's think step by step. The question asks us to determine the number of burgundy items remaining after all notebooks are removed.

1. **Burgundy paperclips:**  The question mentions <fact1>three burgundy paperclips</fact1>. These are not notebooks, so they remain.

2. **Burgundy pairs of sunglasses:** The question mentions <fact11>three burgundy pairs of sunglasses</fact11>. These are not notebooks, so they remain.

3. **Burgundy notebooks:** The question mentions <fact12>three burgundy notebooks</fact12>.  Since we are <fact15>removing all notebooks</fact15>, these are removed.

4. **Burgundy cat toys:** The question mentions <fact13>two burgundy cat toys</fact13>. These are not notebooks, so they remain.

In total, the remaining <fact16>burgundy things</fact16> are: 3 paperclips + 3 pairs of sunglasses + 2 cat toys = 8.
