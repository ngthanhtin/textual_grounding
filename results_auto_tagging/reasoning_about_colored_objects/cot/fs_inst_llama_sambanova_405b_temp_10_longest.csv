On the floor, there are:
- 1 mauve cat toy

1. Initially, on the floor, there are:
   - Three yellow paperclips
   - Three yellow notebooks
   - Three blue paperclips
   - One blue notebook

2. The question asks what happens if all the notebooks are removed from the floor. So, after removing the notebooks, the items remaining on the floor are:
   - Three yellow paperclips
   - Three blue paperclips

3. The question specifically asks about the number of turquoise objects remaining on the floor. However, from the initial list and after removing the notebooks, there is no mention of any turquoise objects.

Therefore, since there are no turquoise objects mentioned in the context of this problem, either initially or after removing the notebooks, the number of turquoise objects remaining on the floor is zero.

According to this question, the items on the table are three green bracelets, one teal dog leash, one green dog leash, and three green paperclips. 

The question asks what happens if all the teal items are removed from the table. Since there is only one teal item, which is the teal dog leash, removing all the teal items means removing just this one item.

The removal of the teal dog leash does not affect the number of paperclips on the table because the teal item is a dog leash, not a paperclip. Therefore, the number of paperclips remains the same.

The number of paperclips on the table initially is three, and it remains three after removing the teal item.

The fidget spinner is the fourth object in the row. Since we are looking for the object furthest from the fidget spinner, we need to look at the two ends of the row. The objects on the left side of the fidget spinner are the silver jug, the yellow scrunchiephone charger, and the red plate. The objects on the right side of the fidget spinner are the fuchsia cup and the pink pen.

The object furthest from the fidget spinner would be the one at the opposite end of the row. In this case, it would be the first object in the row, which is the silver jug, or the last object in the row, which is the pink pen. However, since the question asks for the object furthest from the fidget spinner, we need to consider the entire row. The silver jug is at one end, and the pink pen is at the other end, but they are equidistant in terms of the number of objects from the fidget spinner. However, considering the arrangement, both the first and the last objects are equidistant, but the question seeks the singular answer of the color, so we can choose either end. The color of the silver jug is the one we'll choose for consistency.

However, if we consider the items to the right of the pencil in the context of the question, we should actually look at the items to the left of the pencil in the list, excluding the pencil itself, and then count the non-gold items.

The items to the left of the pencil are the gold textbook, the purple puzzle, and the teal necklace. Among these, the non-gold items are the purple puzzle and the teal necklace.

So, the number of non-gold items that would be considered ""to the right"" in the context of the question's intention (but actually to the left in the list) is two.

Between the fuchsia jug and the yellow keychain, the yellow keychain is indeed at one end of the row, but so is the fuchsia jug at the other end. However, the question's phrasing suggests looking for a singular answer, and typically in such arrangements, we might consider the direction from the mentioned object (silver paperclip) to the end of the row as it's listed or as it implies a sequence.

The item furthest to the left is the gold mug, and the item furthest to the right is the red booklet. Since the distance is the same in both directions (i.e., the gold mug is three items away from the paperclip to the left, and the red booklet is three items away from the paperclip to the right), we can consider either item as the furthest.
