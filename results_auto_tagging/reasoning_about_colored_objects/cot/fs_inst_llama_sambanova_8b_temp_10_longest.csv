The question states that there are two green pencils, one green fidget spinner, three teal fidget spinners, one green stress ball, two teal cat toys, and three green cat toys on the table.

If we remove all the fidget spinners from the table, we are left with the pencils, stress ball, and cat toys.

The pencils are green, the stress ball is green, and the cat toys are green and teal. Since we are counting only the green objects, we can ignore the teal cat toys.

We have two green pencils, one green stress ball, and three green cat toys. In total, we have 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 green objects.

The silver items on the desk include:

There are no silver dog leashes that are orange, so all the silver dog leashes are not orange.

The number of silver dog leashes is 3.

After removing all the silver items, the number of dog leashes that remain on the desk is the initial number of dog leashes minus the number of silver dog leashes.
The number of dog leashes that remain on the desk is 15 - 3 = 12.
