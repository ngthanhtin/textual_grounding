If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?","To find out how many problems are on each page, we first need to determine the total number of problems Sarah has left. She started with 55 problems and finished 6, so she has 55 - 6 = 49 problems left. 

Since she has 7 pages of problems left, we can divide the total number of problems left by the number of pages to find the number of problems per page. 

49 problems / 7 pages = 7 problems per page.

44,"Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. If she finished 44 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework?","To find out how many problems Paige has left for homework, we need to calculate the total number of problems she had initially and subtract the number of problems she finished at school. 

Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems, so the total number of problems is 43 + 12 = 55. 

Since she finished 44 problems at school, which is more than the total number of problems she had, it is likely that the problem statement contains an error. However, if we follow the given information, we can calculate the number of problems she has left for homework as follows:

Total problems = 55
Problems finished at school = 44 (although this is more than the total, we will proceed with the calculation)
Problems left for homework = Total problems - Problems finished at school
Problems left for homework = 55 - 44
Problems left for homework = 11

However, considering the context, it is likely that Paige finished fewer problems at school than the total number of problems she had. If that's the case, the correct calculation would be:

Problems left for homework = Total problems - Problems finished at school
Problems left for homework = 55 - (a number less than 55, for example, let's say 40)
Problems left for homework = 55 - 40
Problems left for homework = 15

Since the problem statement is likely incorrect, I will provide an answer based on the assumption that Paige finished fewer problems at school than the total number of problems she had.
