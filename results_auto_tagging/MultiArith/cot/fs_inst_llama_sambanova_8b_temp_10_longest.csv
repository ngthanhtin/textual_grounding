Tom had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. Each pile had 5 coins in it.

The number of quarters is 2 piles * 5 coins/pile = 10 quarters.
The number of dimes is 4 piles * 5 coins/pile = 20 dimes.

Since a quarter is worth 25 cents and a dime is worth 10 cents, we can convert the number of quarters and dimes to cents.

10 quarters = 10 * 25 = 250 cents
20 dimes = 20 * 10 = 200 cents

Now, we can add the total number of cents to find the total number of coins.

250 cents + 200 cents = 450 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 450 cents to dollars by dividing by 100.

450 cents / 100 = 4.5 dollars

However, the question asks for the total number of coins, not the total value in dollars. Since each quarter and dime is a single coin, we can simply add the number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins.

10 quarters + 20 dimes = 30 coins

She has 39 shirts and 33 sweaters, so the total number of pieces of clothing is 39 + 33 = 72.

Since her washing machine can only wash 8 pieces at a time, we need to divide the total number of pieces by 8 to find out how many loads she needs to do. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

However, since 72 is not exactly divisible by 8, we need to find out how many pieces are left over after the 9th load. 

To do this, we can multiply 9 by 8 to get the total number of pieces that can be washed in 9 loads: 9 × 8 = 72.

Since 72 is greater than 72, we know that there are 0 pieces left over.

Therefore, Wendy will need to do 9 loads to wash all her clothes.

She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, making a total of 5+35=40 pictures.

Since she sorted the pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by 8. 

40 ÷ 8 = 5

If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need?","To determine how many vans are needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip. There are 40 students and 14 adults, so the total number of people is 40 + 14 = 54. Since each van can hold 9 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per van: 54 ÷ 9 = 6. However, since we can't have a fraction of a van, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 7 vans.

If a level has 7 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?","To find out how many points you'll earn, you need to first determine how many enemies you defeated. Since there are 7 enemies in total and you destroyed all but 2 of them, you must have defeated 7-2=5 enemies.

460,"A worksheet had 2 problems on it. If a teacher had 14 worksheets to grade and had already graded 7 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?","The worksheet had 2 problems on it. The teacher had 14 worksheets to grade and had already graded 7 of them. Since each worksheet has 2 problems, the total number of problems is 2 * 14 = 28. The teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, which means she has graded 7 * 2 = 14 problems. To find the number of problems left to grade, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems: 28 - 14 = 14. However, since each worksheet has 2 problems, we need to divide the remaining problems by 2 to find the number of worksheets left to grade: 14 / 2 = 7. 

Since each worksheet has 2 problems, and the teacher has 7 worksheets left to grade, the total number of problems left to grade is 7 * 2 = 14.

She baked 5 brownies and used 7 cups of flour for each one, so she used a total of 5×7=35 cups of flour.

Since Zoe needs a total of 11 brownies and she already has 5, she needs to make 11-5=6 more brownies. Each brownie requires 7 cups of flour, so she will need 6×7=42 cups of flour to make the remaining brownies.

To find out how much flour Zoe still needs, we subtract the amount she has already used (35 cups) from the amount she needs to use (42 cups): 42-35=7 cups.

If everyone else scored 6 points each, we can subtract Paige's points and her share of the remaining points to find out how many points the other players scored in total. 

First, we subtract Paige's 11 points from the total: 41 - 11 = 30 points left for the other players.

Since each of the other players scored 6 points, we can divide the remaining points by 6 to find out how many players there were: 30 / 6 = 5 players.

To find the total number of players on Paige's team, we add Paige herself to the number of other players: 5 + 1 = 6 players.

512,Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?,"To find out how many small gardens Emily had, we need to subtract the number of seeds she planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds she planted in the big garden and the small gardens combined. 

First, let's find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens. We know that she planted 4 seeds in each small garden. If we let x be the number of small gardens, then the total number of seeds she planted in the small gardens is 4x.

We also know that she planted 29 seeds in the big garden. So, the total number of seeds she planted is 4x + 29.

We know that she started with 41 seeds. Since she planted all the seeds, the total number of seeds she planted is equal to the number of seeds she started with. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4x + 29 = 41

To solve for x, we can subtract 29 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 41 - 29
4x = 12

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So, Emily had 3 small gardens."

Now, divide the 8 points by the 4 points each other player scored: 8 ÷ 4 = 2 players.

Since we know Katie scored 4 points, we need to add her to the number of other players to get the total number of players on the team: 2 + 1 = 3.

However, the question states that Katie's team won and scored 12 points total, and it also states ""Katie's team"" which implies that Katie is part of the team. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that Katie is one of the players who scored 4 points each, and the total number of players is the total number of points scored divided by the points each player scored.

So, the total number of players is 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

The answer is {3}."
