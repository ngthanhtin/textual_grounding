If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find out how many trips Dave will make, we need to first find out the total number of trays he needs to pick up. There are 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, so the total number of trays is 17 + 55 = 72.

Since Dave can only carry 9 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 9 to find out how many trips he will make. 

72 ÷ 9 = 8.

If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find out how many trips Jerry will make, we first need to find out the total number of trays he needs to pick up. He has to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, so the total number of trays is 9 + 7 = 16 trays.

Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, he'll need to make multiple trips. To find out how many trips, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip: 16 ÷ 8 = 2. However, this leaves a remainder, as 16 is not evenly divisible by 8. 

16 ÷ 8 = 2 with a remainder of 0. But we still have 0 trays left to pick up after 2 trips. 

So the correct calculation is: 
He can pick up 8 trays in the first trip and 8 trays in the second trip.

Therefore, Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up the trays.

Since Amy can finish 4 problems in an hour, we can divide the total number of problems by 4 to find out how many hours it will take her to finish all the problems. 

24 problems / 4 problems per hour = 6 hours.

376,Sarah's old washing machine could only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?,"To find out how many loads Sarah needs to do, we first need to calculate the total number of clothing items she has to wash. She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters, making a total of 43 + 2 = 45 items.

Since her washing machine can only wash 5 pieces at a time, we need to divide the total number of items by 5 to find out how many loads she needs to do. 

45 ÷ 5 = 9

380,Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?,"To find out how many loads Nancy needs to do, we first need to find out the total number of clothing items she needs to wash. She has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters, so the total number of items is 19 + 8 = 27.

Since her washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we need to divide the total number of items by 9 to find out how many loads she needs to do. 

27 ÷ 9 = 3. 

However, since 27 is not exactly divisible by 9 (3 * 9 = 27), the result is a whole number, which means she can wash all her clothes in 3 loads.

10 ÷ 5 = 2

So, Paul can buy 2 toys with the money he has.

To display the bears, they put 9 bears on each shelf. To find the number of shelves used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf: 27÷9=3. Since 27 is not exactly divisible by 9 (27 = 3×9), we know that 3 shelves were completely filled, but there are still some bears left. The remainder of the division is 0 (since 3×9=27). However, in this case, the remainder is 0, which means the toy store used exactly 3 shelves.

Since each van can hold 9 people, we can divide the total number of people by 9 to find out how many vans are needed. 54 ÷ 9 = 6. However, since we can't have a fraction of a van, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there's a remainder. In this case, 54 divided by 9 leaves no remainder, so we don't need to round up.

498,"Sam invited 9 friends to a birthday party, but 6 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 2, how many should he buy?","To find out how many cupcakes Sam should buy, we first need to determine how many friends are coming to the party.

Since Sam also needs a cupcake, we should include him in the total number of people. So, there will be 3 friends + 1 (Sam) = 4 people at the party.

If each person gets exactly 2 cupcakes, we multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person gets: 4 × 2 = 8 cupcakes.
