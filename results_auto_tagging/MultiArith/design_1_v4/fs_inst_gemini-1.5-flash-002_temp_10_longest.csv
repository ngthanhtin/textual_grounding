How many students didn't make the cut?

Answer:  First, we need to find the total number of students who tried out. There were <fact1>30 girls</fact1> and <fact2>36 boys</fact2>, so there were 30 + 36 = 66 students in total.  <fact3>Only 10 students got called back</fact3>.

Therefore, 56 students didn't make the cut. The answer is {56}.

Nancy uploaded `<fact1>41 pictures</fact1>` to Facebook. She put `<fact2>37 pics</fact2>` into one album and put the rest into `<fact3>2 different albums</fact3>`.  How many pictures were in each of the `<fact3>2 different albums</fact3>`?


**Answer:**

Nancy uploaded a total of `<fact1>41 pictures</fact1>`.  She placed `<fact2>37 pictures</fact2>` in one album. To find out how many pictures are left to be divided among the other two albums, we subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures: `<fact1>41</fact1> - `<fact2>37</fact2>` = 4 pictures.

Since these remaining 4 pictures were split evenly across `<fact3>2 different albums</fact3>`, we divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums: 4 pictures / `<fact3>2 albums</fact3>` = 2 pictures per album.

Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the other two albums. The answer is {2}.
