During the year, <fact2>3 students left</fact2> and <fact3>42 new students came to school</fact3>. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
Answer: The question states that there were <fact1>4 students</fact1> at the start of the year. After <fact2>3 students left</fact2>, the number of students decreased by 3. However, the question also states that <fact3>42 new students came to school</fact3>, which means the number of students increased by 42. To find the total number of students at the end, we need to add the number of students who left to the number of new students. So, 3 (students who left) + 42 (new students) = 45. However, this calculation is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial number of students. To find the correct answer, we need to add the initial number of students to the number of new students and then subtract the number of students who left. So, the correct calculation is: 4 (initial students) + 42 (new students) - 3 (students who left) = 43."

If each cage has <fact2>2 parrots and 6 parakeets</fact2> in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?
Answer: The pet store has <fact1>9 bird cages</fact1>, and each cage has <fact2>2 parrots and 6 parakeets</fact2>. To find the total number of birds, we need to multiply the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage. Since there are <fact2>2 parrots and 6 parakeets</fact2> in each cage, we can find the total number of birds in each cage by adding the number of parrots and parakeets: <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact2>6</fact2> = <fact2>8</fact2> birds per cage. Now, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage: <fact1>9</fact1> × <fact2>8</fact2> = <fact3>72</fact3> birds. The answer is {72}."

If he had to pick up <fact2>17 trays from one table</fact2> and <fact3>55 trays from another</fact3>, how many trips will he make?

Answer: Dave can only carry <fact1>9 trays at a time</fact1>. To find out how many trips he'll make, we need to find out how many sets of 9 trays he can carry. First, let's find out how many trays he has to pick up in total: <fact2>17 trays</fact2> from one table and <fact3>55 trays</fact3> from another, totaling 17+55=72 trays. To find out how many sets of 9 trays he can carry, we'll divide the total number of trays by 9: 72 ÷ 9 = 8. Since he can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll make 8 trips to pick up the trays from one table. However, he still has to pick up <fact3>55 trays from another</fact3>, which is more than 8 sets of 9 trays. So, he'll need to make 6 more trips to pick up the remaining trays, making a total of 8+6=14 trips. The answer is {14}."

If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","Reformatted Question: Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry <fact1>9 trays at a time</fact1>. If he had to pick up <fact2>29 trays from one table</fact2> and <fact3>52 trays from another</fact3>, how many trips will he make?
Answer: Henry can carry <fact1>9 trays at a time</fact1>, so he'll need to make multiple trips. First, let's find out how many trips he'll need to make for the <fact2>29 trays from one table</fact2>. To do this, we'll divide the number of trays by the number of trays he can carry: 29 ÷ <fact1>9</fact1> = 3.22. Since he can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 4 trips for the <fact2>29 trays from one table</fact2>. Next, let's find out how many trips he'll need to make for the <fact3>52 trays from another</fact3>. To do this, we'll divide the number of trays by the number of trays he can carry: 52 ÷ <fact1>9</fact1> = 5.78. Since he can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 6 trips for the <fact3>52 trays from another</fact3>. In total, Henry will need to make 4 + 6 = 10 trips."

If <fact1>each van can hold 8 people</fact1> and there are <fact2>22 students</fact2> and <fact3>2 adults going</fact3>, how many vans will they need?
Answer: To find out how many vans they need, we need to calculate the total number of people going.

391,"Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 8 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds, how many points did they earn?","Reformatted Question: Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every <fact1>8 pounds</fact1> they recycled, they earned <fact2>one point</fact2>. If Zoe recycled <fact3>25 pounds</fact3> and her friends recycled <fact4>23 pounds</fact4>, how many points did they earn?
Answer: To find the total points earned, we need to first calculate the points earned by Zoe and her friends separately. Since Zoe recycled <fact3>25 pounds</fact3> and each <fact1>8 pounds</fact1> earns <fact2>one point</fact2>, we can find the points earned by Zoe by dividing 25 by 8. However, since 25 is not a multiple of 8, we need to find the quotient and remainder when 25 is divided by 8. This can be done using the division algorithm, which states that for any non-negative integers a and b (with b ≠ 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r and 0 ≤ r < b. In this case, we have a = 25 and b = 8. Using the division algorithm, we find that 25 = 8(3) + 1, so the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 1. This means that Zoe earned 3 points (since she recycled 24 pounds, which is a multiple of 8) and 1 point (since she recycled 1 pound, which is the remainder). Similarly, her friends recycled <fact4>23 pounds</fact4>, which is 8(2) + 7, so they earned 2 points (since they recycled 16 pounds, which is a multiple of 8) and 1 point (since they recycled 7 pounds, which is the remainder). Therefore, Zoe and her friends earned a total of (3+1) + (2+1) = 7 points. The answer is {7}."
392,"Billy was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 42 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?","Reformatted Question: Billy was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with <fact1>5 on each page</fact1>. If he had <fact2>3 new cards</fact2> and <fact3>42 old cards</fact3> to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
Answer: To find the total number of cards, we need to add the new cards and the old cards. So, <fact2>3 new cards</fact2> + <fact3>42 old cards</fact3> = <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>42</fact3> = <fact4>45</fact4> cards in total. Since there are <fact1>5 cards on each page</fact1>, we can find the number of pages by dividing the total number of cards by 5. So, <fact4>45</fact4> ÷ <fact1>5</fact1> = <fact5>9</fact5> pages. The answer is {9}."

Answer: Victor can carry <fact1>7 trays at a time</fact1>, so he'll need to make trips to pick up <fact2>23 trays</fact2> and <fact3>5 trays</fact3>. To find the total number of trips, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip. First, we add the number of trays from both tables: <fact2>23 trays</fact2> + <fact3>5 trays</fact3> = 28 trays. Then, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip: 28 trays / <fact1>7 trays per trip</fact1> = 4 trips."

Answer: Wendy put <fact2>27 pics</fact2> into one album, and the rest were put into <fact3>9 different albums</fact3>. To find the number of pictures in each of the <fact3>9 different albums</fact3>, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures. The total number of pictures is <fact1>45</fact1>, and the number of pictures in the first album is <fact2>27</fact2>. So, the number of pictures in the rest of the albums is <fact1>45</fact1>−<fact2>27</fact2>=18. Since these 18 pictures are put into <fact3>9 different albums</fact3>, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures in the rest of the albums by the number of albums. Therefore, the number of pictures in each album is 18÷<fact3>9</fact3>=2."

She put <fact2>17 pics into one album</fact2> and put the rest into <fact3>6 different albums</fact3>. How many pictures were in each album?
Answer: To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to first determine how many pictures were left after Haley put 17 into one album. Since she put 17 into one album, that means she put 65−17=48 pictures into the other 6 albums. Now, to find out how many pictures were in each of the 6 albums, we divide the total number of pictures in those albums (48) by the number of albums (6). 48÷6=8. So, there were 8 pictures in each of the 6 albums."
