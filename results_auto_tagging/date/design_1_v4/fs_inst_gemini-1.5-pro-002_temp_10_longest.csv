Answer:
Jane quit her job on <fact1>March 20, 2020</fact1>.  <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. 176 days is equal to roughly 5 months and 26 days (176/30 ≈ 5.86). Adding that to March 20, 2020, puts us somewhere around late September.

To be precise:

March has 31 days, so from March 20th to March 31st is 11 days (31 - 20 = 11).
That leaves 165 days (176 - 11 = 165).

April has 30 days.
165 - 30 = 135 days remaining.

May has 31 days.
135 - 31 = 104 days remaining.

June has 30 days.
104 - 30 = 74 days remaining.

July has 31 days.
74 - 31 = 43 days remaining.

August has 31 days.
43 - 31 = 12 days remaining.

That leaves us with 12 days in September.  So adding 12 days to the beginning of September brings us to September 12th.


Therefore, today's date is 09/12/2020. The answer is {09/12/2020}.

March 20, 2020 is the 79th day of the year (since 2020 is not a leap year).
Adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to this gives us the 255th day of the year (79 + 176 = 255).

The 255th day of the year is September 12, 2020. Therefore today is September 12, 2020.

Answer:
Jane quit her job on <fact1>March 20, 2020</fact1>. <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. 176 days is approximately 5 months and 26 days. Adding that to <fact1>March 20, 2020</fact1>, we get approximately September 15, 2020. So today is approximately September 15, 2020.  <fact3>One year ago from today</fact3> would then be approximately September 15, 2019.

To get the precise date, we can add 176 days to March 20, 2020:

March has 31 days, so there are 11 days remaining in March after the 20th (31-20=11).
176 - 11 = 165 days remaining.
April has 30 days. 165 - 30 = 135 days remaining.
May has 31 days. 135 - 31 = 104 days remaining.
June has 30 days. 104 - 30 = 74 days remaining.
July has 31 days. 74 - 31 = 43 days remaining.
August has 31 days. 43 - 31 = 12 days remaining.
So, 176 days after March 20, 2020 is September 12, 2020.

Therefore, today is September 12, 2020, and <fact3>one year ago</fact3> was September 12, 2019.

The answer is {09/12/2019}.

Answer: The question asks for the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today. Since today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>, and we are looking for the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3>, we simply subtract 7 days from <fact1>9/7</fact1>. The fact that Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2> is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, <fact3>one week ago</fact3> was 9/0.

One week ago it was 08/31/2024. The answer is {08/31/2024}.
