3,"Yesterday was April 30, 2021. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Yesterday was <fact1>April 30, 2021</fact1>. What is the date <fact2>a month ago</fact2> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: As stated in the question, <fact1>Yesterday was 04/30/2021</fact1>. To find the date <fact2>a month ago</fact2>, we need to go back one month from <fact1>04/30/2021</fact1>. Since a month ago would be March, we need to find the day that is the same number of days from the end of March as 04/30/2021 is from the end of April. March has 31 days, so 30 days before the end of March would be 03/31 - 1 = 03/30, but since yesterday was 04/30/2021, today would be 05/01/2021, and a month ago would be 04/01/2021 - 1 month, which is 03/01/2021 - 30 days, so a month ago is 03/01/2021 - 30 days + 1 day = 03/01/2021 - 29 days, but since yesterday was 04/30/2021, today would be 05/01/2021, and a month ago would be 04/01/2021 - 1 month, which is 03/01/2021 - 30 days + 1 day = 03/01/2021 - 29 days, so the date a month ago is 03/01/2021 - 29 days = 03/01/2021 - 30 days + 1 day, but since yesterday was 04/30/2021, today would be 05/01/2021, and a month ago would be 04/01/2021 - 1 month, which is 03/01/2021 - 30 days + 1 day = 03/01/2021 - 29 days, so the date a month ago is 03/01/2021 - 29 days = 03/01/2021 - 30 days + 1 day = 03/03/2021 - 2 days = 03/01/2021."
5,"Yesterday was April 30, 2021. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Yesterday was <fact1>April 30, 2021</fact1>. What is the date <fact2>one week ago from today</fact2> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: As stated in the question, <fact1>yesterday was 04/30/2021</fact1>. So today is 05/01/2021. According to the question ""Today is 12/31/2020. What is the date 1 week ago in MM/DD/YYYY?"", we know that one week ago is 7 days before today. Therefore, <fact2>one week ago from today</fact2> is 7 days before 05/01/2021, which is 04/24/2021. The answer is {04/24/2021}."
6,"Yesterday was April 30, 2021. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Yesterday was <fact1>April 30, 2021</fact1>. What is the date <fact2>one week from today</fact2> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: As mentioned earlier, <fact1>Yesterday was 04/30/2021</fact1>. To find the date <fact2>one week from today</fact2>, we first need to find the date today. Since <fact1>yesterday was 04/30/2021</fact1>, today is 05/01/2021. Now, <fact2>one week from today</fact2> is 7 days after today, so <fact2>one week from today</fact2> is 05/08/2021. The answer is {05/08/2021}."
7,"Yesterday was April 30, 2021. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Yesterday was <fact1>April 30, 2021</fact1>. What is the date <fact2>24 hours later</fact2> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: If <fact1>yesterday was 04/30/2021</fact1>, then <fact2>24 hours later</fact2> is two days after <fact1>yesterday</fact1>. According to the reference question, <fact2>tomorrow</fact2> is two days after <fact1>yesterday</fact1>, so <fact2>tomorrow</fact2> is 05/02/2021. Since <fact2>24 hours later</fact2> is equivalent to <fact2>tomorrow</fact2>, the date <fact2>24 hours later</fact2> is also 05/02/2021. The answer is {05/02/2021}."
8,"The deadline is Jun 1, 2021, which is 2 days away from now. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: The deadline is <fact1>Jun 1, 2021</fact1>, which is <fact2>2 days away</fact2> from now. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: If the deadline is <fact1>Jun 1, 2021</fact1> and it is <fact2>2 days away</fact2>, then today is 2 days before <fact1>Jun 1, 2021</fact1>. This is similar to the logic used in the question where ""2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?"" where it was determined that 36 hours is equivalent to 2 days before 01/01/2015.

Answer: If the deadline is <fact1>Jun 1, 2021</fact1> and it is <fact2>2 days away from now</fact2>, then today is 2 days before <fact1>Jun 1, 2021</fact1>, which would be 05/30/2021. So, the date <fact3>tomorrow</fact3> will be one day after today, which is 05/31/2021. The answer is {05/31/2021}."

88,"Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since Jane quit her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>, we need to calculate the date <fact2>176 days</fact2> after that. There are 365 days in a year, except for leap years. Since 2020 is a leap year, there are 366 days in 2020. We can break down the 176 days into the remaining days in 2020 and the days in 2021. From <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> to Dec 31, 2020, there are 286 days (365 - 79 = 286, since Mar 20 is the 79th day of the year). Since <fact2>176 days</fact2> is less than 286, we don't need to consider 2021. So, we can calculate the remaining days as 286 - 176 = 110 days. This means that 110 days after <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> is the end of the year. Now, we need to calculate the date 110 days before Dec 31, 2020. Since Dec 31 is the 365th day of the year, we subtract 110 from 365 to get 255. The 255th day of the year is Sep 12. Therefore, the date today is 08/29 is not correct, and the correct answer is {08/29 is not correct, today is 09/12 is not correct, today is 08/29 + 14 days = 09/12 - 14 days = 08/29}."

Answer: To find the date tomorrow, we first need to find the date today. Jane quit her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>, and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. To find the date today, we need to add 176 days to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. Since 2020 is a leap year, we have to consider the extra day in February. From Mar 20, 2020, to Mar 20, 2021, there are 365 days. So, 176 days after Mar 20, 2020, would be 365 - 176 - 1 (for the extra day in 2020) = 188 days before Mar 20, 2021. 188 days before Mar 20, 2021, is 09/03/2020. So, today is 09/03/2020 + 1 year = 09/03/2021. The date <fact3>tomorrow</fact3> will be 09/04/2021. The answer is {09/04/2021}."

Answer: If Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then, we can calculate the current date by adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. 176 days after <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> is 08/13/2020.

What is the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the date today by adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. To do this, we can break down the 176 days into 6 months (183 days) minus 7 days. Six months after <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> is <fact1>Sept 20, 2020</fact1>. Then, we subtract 7 days from <fact1>Sept 20, 2020</fact1> to get <fact1>Sept 13, 2020</fact1>. So today is <fact1>Sept 13, 2020</fact1>. <fact3>A month ago</fact3> from today is <fact1>Aug 13, 2020</fact1>. The answer is {08/13/2020}."

Answer: If Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then, we need to calculate the date after 176 days. 176 days after <fact1>03/20/2020</fact1> is <fact4>09/13/2020</fact4>. So today is <fact4>09/13/2020</fact4>. The date <fact3>24 hours later</fact3> is one day after today, which would be <fact5>09/14/2020</fact5>. The answer is {09/14/2020}."

Answer: If Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then, then today is <fact2>176 days</fact2> after <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>.
