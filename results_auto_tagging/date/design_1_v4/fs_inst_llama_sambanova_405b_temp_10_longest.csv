88,"Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. <fact2>176 days have passed</fact2> since then. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: To find today's date, we need to add <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. Since there are 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 days in June, and 31 days in July, we can calculate the number of days passed in each month. 

From March 20 to March 31, there are 11 days. 
From April 1 to April 30, there are 30 days. 
From May 1 to May 31, there are 31 days. 
From June 1 to June 30, there are 30 days. 
From July 1 to July 31, there are 31 days. 
From August 1 to August 4, there are 4 days. 

Adding these up, we get 11 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 4 = 137 days. We still need to add 39 days (176 - 137) to reach 176 days. Since we already added 4 days in August, we need to add 35 more days to August, which brings us to September 8, and then add the remaining 4 days. 

So, today's date is September 8 + 4 days = September 12, but since we started counting from March 20, we should actually count from March 20 to September 8 and then add the remaining 4 days. However, the correct calculation is as follows:

March (11 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (31 days) + August (31 days) + 4 days in September = 168 days. We still need to add 8 days (176 - 168) to reach 176 days. Since we already added 4 days in September, we need to add 4 more days to September 4, which brings us to September 8, and then add the remaining 4 days. 

So, today's date is September 8 + 4 days = September 12.

However, a more accurate calculation is as follows:

March 20 to March 31 = 11 days
April = 30 days
May = 31 days
June = 30 days
July = 31 days
August = 31 days
September = 8 days (to reach 168 days)
Remaining days = 176 - 168 = 8 days

Since we have 8 remaining days and we already added 8 days in September to reach September 8, we can simply add the remaining 8 days to September 8, but that would be incorrect. Instead, we should add the remaining 8 days to September 8, but since we already counted 8 days in September, we should actually add the remaining 8 days to the last day of the previous count, which is August 31 + 8 days in September = September 8, and then add the remaining 8 days, which would be September 16.

However, the correct answer can be obtained by simply adding 176 days to March 20, 2020.

March 20, 2020 + 176 days = September 12 is incorrect.

Let's recalculate:

March has 31 days. From March 20 to March 31, there are 11 days. The remaining days in the year are: 
April (30 days), May (31 days), June (30 days), July (31 days), August (31 days). 

11 days (March) + 30 days (April) + 31 days (May) + 30 days (June) + 31 days (July) + 31 days (August) = 164 days.

We still need to add 12 days (176 - 164) to reach 176 days. Since August has 31 days, we can add the remaining 12 days to August 31, which would bring us to September 12, but we actually need to add 12 days to August 31. 

August 31 + 12 days = September 12.

However, the correct answer can be obtained by simply adding 176 days to March 20, 2020.

March 20, 2020 + 176 days = September 12.

The answer is {09/12/2020}."

Answer: To find the date <fact3>tomorrow</fact3>, we first need to find today's date. We know that Jane quit her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. We can calculate the date by adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. 

Mar has 31 days, so from Mar 20 to Mar 31, there are 11 days. Then we have 12 months with 30 or 31 days (Apr with 30 days, May with 31 days, Jun with 30 days, Jul with 31 days, Aug with 31 days, Sep with 30 days, Oct with 31 days, Nov with 30 days, Dec with 31 days, Jan with 31 days, Feb with 28 days in 2021 since it is not a leap year, and Mar with 31 days), and from Apr to Aug, we have used 153 days (11 days in Mar, and 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 152 days from Apr to Aug, and 1 day in Sep). Now we have 23 days left to use (176 - 153 = 23). 

Sep has 30 days, so we will use all the days in Sep (30 - 1 = 29 days since we have used 1 day in Sep, but we only have 23 days left, so we will use 23 days in Sep). Now we have used all the <fact2>176 days</fact2>, and we are at Sep 20 + 23 = Sep 13 + 30 = Sep 43, which is Oct 13 (since Sep only has 30 days). 

So today is Sep 13 + 23 = Oct 6, 2020. The date <fact3>tomorrow</fact3> is one day after today, so the date <fact3>tomorrow</fact3> is Oct 7, 2020. The answer is {09/13/2020 + 23 days = 10/06/2020 + 1 day = 10/07/2020}."

Answer: To find the date <fact3>yesterday</fact3>, we first need to find today's date. We know that Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days have passed</fact2> since then. There are 31 days in March, 30 in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, and 30 in September. This adds up to 184 days from March 20 to September 20, but we only need 176 days. So, we need to subtract 8 days from September 20. This would be September 12. However, we are looking for the date <fact3>yesterday</fact3>, which is one day before September 12.

Answer: Since Jane quit her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then, we can calculate the current date by adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. This would be 09/12/2020. To find the date <fact3>10 days ago</fact3>, we subtract 10 days from the current date, resulting in 09/02/2020. The answer is {09/02/2020}."

What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Jane quited her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. What is the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: To find the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3>, we first need to find the current date. We know that Jane quit her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then. 

We can calculate the current date by adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. 

176 days is equivalent to 5 months and 27 days (since 176 = 5*30 + 26, but 26 days from March 20th will be April 15th, and then 5 more months will be September 15th, and then one more day is the 16th, but then there are 30 and 31 day months in between, so it is actually 5 months and 27 days). 

So, adding 5 months and 27 days to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> gives us a date of September 16, 2020 (20 + 27 = 47, so it is 16 days into the next month after adding 5 months to March).

However, since we added only 5 months and 26 days to get to September 15th, and then added one more day to get to the 16th, we can verify that this is correct by adding 176 days to March 20th.

March has 31 days, so 11 days into April is March 20th + 11 days = March 31st. Then 30 days in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, and then 30 days in August and then 15 days into September is 11 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 15 = 168 days. And then 8 more days is 176 days, so it is actually September 8th + 8 days = September 16th, 2020.

Then, <fact3>a month ago</fact3> from September 16, 2020 would be August 16, 2020.

The answer is {08/16/2020}."

Answer: To find the date <fact3>one year ago from today</fact3>, we first need to find the date today.

What is the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: To find the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today, we first need to find today's date. Since Jane quit her job on <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1> and <fact2>176 days</fact2> have passed since then, we can calculate today's date by adding <fact2>176 days</fact2> to <fact1>Mar 20, 2020</fact1>. 

Mar has 31 days, so from Mar 20 to Mar 31 is 11 days. Then we have 165 days left (176 - 11 = 165). 

Apr has 30 days, May has 31 days, Jun has 30 days, Jul has 31 days, Aug has 31 days. So from Apr 1 to Aug 31 is 153 days. We have 12 days left (165 - 153 = 12).

Sep has 30 days. So 12 days after Aug 31 will be Sep 12. 

So today is Sep 12, 2020.

Mar: 31 days, Apr: 30 days, May: 31 days, Jun: 30 days, Jul: 31 days, Aug: 31 days. 
20 + (31-20) + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 204. But we only need 176 days, so we subtract 28 from 204, which leads to the end of August. 

So, the current date is 08/28/2020 (or 09/08, 07/08 cannot be correct because we are only adding 176 days to the date 03/20). 08/28 + 1 day is 08/29. The answer is {08/29/2020}."
97,2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: If <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>, then it is coming in 2 days (24 hours * 1.5 = 36 hours). 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014. The answer is {12/30/2014}."
98,2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>tomorrow</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: If <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>, then it is coming in 2 days (1 day is 24 hours, 36 hours is 1 day and 12 hours, 12 hours is half a day, so 36 hours is 1.5 days or 2 days if rounding to the nearest day) (if rounding to 1.5 days then today is 12/31, and tomorrow is 01/01 which still gives the same answer). 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014. So <fact3>tomorrow</fact3> will be 12/31/2014. The answer is {12/31/2014}."
99,2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>yesterday</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: If <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>, then it is coming in 2 days (since 36 hours is equivalent to 1.5 days, but since we can't have half a day in this context, it means the event will occur at some point during the next day, which is 2 days from the current date) minus 12 hours. Since we're counting from the current day, 1 day from now would be 12/31, and the next day would be 01/01. 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, and 1 day before 12/30 is 12/29. So, the date <fact3>yesterday</fact3> is 12/29/2014. The answer is {12/29/2014}."
100,2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>10 days ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: If <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>, then it is coming in 2 days (36 hours / 24 hours per day = 1.5 days, but since it can't be a fraction of a day in this context, it is 2 days because 2015 starts at the beginning of the day). 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014 (as calculated in a similar question), so today is 12/30/2014. So <fact3>10 days ago</fact3> will be 10 days before 12/30/2014, which is 12/20/2014. The answer is {12/20/2014}."

Answer: If <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>, then it is coming in 2 days (36 hours / 24 hours per day = 1.5 days, but since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to 2 days). 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014. So <fact3>a month ago</fact3> will be 11/30/2014. The answer is {11/30/2014}."

Answer: If <fact1>2015</fact1> is coming in <fact2>36 hours</fact2>, then it is coming in 2 days (24 hours/day * 1.5 days = 36 hours). 2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014 (01/01/2015 - 2 days), but since it says coming in 36 hours, that means today is 12/30/2014 - 1 day = 12/29/2014. So <fact3>one week ago from today</fact3> will be 12/29/2014 - 7 days = 12/22/2014. The answer is {12/22/2014}."

What is the date <fact3>yesterday</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since today is <fact1>3/5</fact1> and it is Jane's second time in the year <fact2>1973</fact2> to see a meteor shower, we can assume that the first time was on a previous date in the same year. However, the exact date of the first meteor shower is not provided. Given that today is <fact1>3/5</fact1>, we can determine that <fact3>yesterday</fact3> would be one day before today, which would be 03/04/1973. The answer is {03/04/1973}."
161,"Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>3/5</fact1>, and it is Jane's second time in the year <fact2>1973</fact2> to see a meteor shower. What is the date <fact3>10 days ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since Jane has seen the meteor shower twice in <fact2>1973</fact2>, and today is <fact1>3/5</fact1>, the first time she saw it must have been on a date before today in <fact2>1973</fact2>. Given that meteor showers are typically spaced about a month apart, it is likely that Jane saw the first meteor shower in February. However, we don't need to find the exact date of the first meteor shower to answer the question. We only need to find the date <fact3>10 days ago</fact3> from today. To do this, we can simply subtract 10 days from today's date, <fact1>3/5</fact1>. 

Subtracting 10 days from <fact1>3/5</fact1> gives us 02/23. So the answer is {02/23/1973}."
162,"Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?","Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>3/5</fact1>, and it is Jane's second time in the year <fact2>1973</fact2> to see a meteor shower. What is the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since Jane has seen a meteor shower for the second time in the year <fact2>1973</fact2>, and today is <fact1>3/5</fact1>, we can infer that the first meteor shower occurred in February, because it is already March. Given that meteor showers typically occur at the same time each year, it is likely that the first one occurred in early February. However, this information is not crucial to answering the question. To find the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3>, we simply need to subtract one month from the current date, <fact1>3/5</fact1>. Therefore, the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3> would be 2/5/1973. The answer is {02/05/1973}."

What is the date <fact3>one year ago from today</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since today is <fact1>3/5</fact1> and the year is <fact2>1973</fact2>, we can conclude that today's date is 03/05/1973. To find the date <fact3>one year ago from today</fact3>, we need to subtract one year from the current year. So, the date <fact3>one year ago from today</fact3> would be 03/05/1972. The answer is {03/05/1972}."

Answer: Since today is <fact1>3/5</fact1> and it is Jane's second time in the year <fact2>1973</fact2> to see a meteor shower, we can assume the first time was on a date before <fact1>3/5</fact1> but still in the same year <fact2>1973</fact2>. However, this information is not necessary to answer the question. To find the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today, we simply subtract 7 days from <fact1>3/5</fact1>. Since <fact1>3/5</fact1> is March 5th, subtracting 7 days gives us February 26th. Therefore, the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today is 02/26/1973. The answer is {02/26/1973}."

So today is 09/07/2003. The date <fact3>yesterday</fact3> would be one day before today, which is 09/06/2003. The answer is {09/06/2003}."
268,Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>. Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>10 days ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since today is <fact1>9/7</fact1> and the year is not explicitly mentioned in the question, we can infer the year from the fact that Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>, which implies that today is 09/07/2003. To find the date <fact3>10 days ago</fact3>, we subtract 10 days from 09/07/2003, which gives us 08/28/2003. The answer is {08/28/2003}."
269,Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>. Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since today is <fact1>9/7</fact1> and Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>, we can infer that today is 09/07/2003. To find the date <fact3>a month ago</fact3>, we subtract one month from today's date. So, <fact3>a month ago</fact3> would be 08/07/2003. The answer is {08/07/2003}."
270,Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>. Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>one year ago from today</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since today is <fact1>9/7</fact1> and Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>, we can infer that today is 09/07/2003. To find the date <fact3>one year ago from today</fact3>, we subtract one year from 09/07/2003, which gives us 09/07/2002. The answer is {09/07/2002}."
271,Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>. Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: To determine the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3> from today, we need to first establish the current year. Since Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>, we can infer that the current year is indeed <fact2>2003</fact2>. Given that today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>, we can deduce that today's date is 09/07/2003. To find the date <fact3>one week ago</fact3>, we subtract 7 days from today's date, resulting in 08/31/2003. The answer is {08/31/2003}."
272,Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>. Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>one week from today</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since the year is not provided in <fact1>9/7</fact1>, we will use the year from <fact2>2003</fact2> to assume the date is 09/07/2003. To find the date <fact3>one week from today</fact3>, we add 7 days to 09/07/2003. So the date <fact3>one week from today</fact3> is 09/14/2003. The answer is {09/14/2003}."
273,Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Reformatted Question: Today is <fact1>9/7</fact1>. Jane is watching NFL <fact2>2003</fact2>. What is the date <fact3>24 hours later</fact3> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since <fact2>2003</fact2> is the year of the NFL game, and no specific date is mentioned for the game, we can assume that the year of the game is not directly relevant to the current date. We are given that <fact1>today is 9/7</fact1>, but the year is not specified. To find the date <fact3>24 hours later</fact3>, we need to add one day to the current date. Therefore, the date <fact3>24 hours later</fact3> would be 9/8, but the year is still unknown. However, since the question asks for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we can assume that the year is the same as the current year, but it is not provided in the question. If we consider the context of the previous questions, we might infer that the year could be 2003, but it's not explicitly stated. So, the answer would be {09/08/2003} if we assume the year is 2003."

Answer: Since yesterday was <fact1>12/31/1929</fact1> and today cannot be <fact2>12/32/1929</fact2> because December has only <fact3>31 days</fact3>, today must be the first day of the next year, which is 01/01/1930.

Today could not be <fact2>12/32/1929</fact2> because December has only <fact3>31 days</fact3>. What is the date <fact4>10 days ago</fact4> in MM/DD/YYYY?

Answer: Since yesterday was <fact1>12/31/1929</fact1>, today is 01/01/1930. To find the date <fact4>10 days ago</fact4>, we need to subtract 10 days from today. So, we subtract 10 days from 01/01/1930. Since December has only <fact3>31 days</fact3>, we go back to December and subtract the remaining days. 01/01/1930 minus 1 day is 12/31/1929, and then we still need to subtract 9 more days. 12/31/1929 minus 9 days is 12/22/1929. The answer is {12/22/1929}."
