Dec 1, 2016 + 1 year = Dec 1, 2017
Dec 1, 2017 + 1 year = Dec 1, 2018
Dec 1, 2018 + 1 year = Dec 1, 2019

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the date one year ago from today. Since today is Dec 1, 2019, one year ago from today would be Dec 1, 2018.

There are 30 days in March, so 176 days will have 5 full months (March, April, May, June, and June) and 11 days left over.

March has 30 days, so 30 days are already accounted for.
April has 30 days, so another 30 days are accounted for.
May has 31 days, so another 31 days are accounted for.
June has 30 days, so another 30 days are accounted for.

To find the current date, we can add 176 days to 03/20/2020. 
Since there are 30 days in March, 31 days in April, 30 days in May, 31 days in June, 30 days in July, 31 days in August, 31 days in September, 30 days in October, and 31 days in November, and 31 days in December, there are 7 months with 31 days and 4 months with 30 days.

176 days = 5 months with 31 days and 1 month with 30 days
5 months with 31 days = 155 days
176 - 155 = 21 days
21 days = 3 weeks and 0 days
Since 03/20/2020 is a Friday, adding 3 weeks and 0 days to it would be 05/15/2020.

Therefore, the current date is 05/15/2020.
Tomorrow is one day after today, so tomorrow is 05/16/2020.

5 weeks is 35 days, so we have 6 days left.
March 20 + 6 days is March 26.

So, today is March 26, 2020.

Yesterday was March 25, 2020.

The answer is {03/25/2020}."

93,"Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?","To find the date one year ago from today, we need to first find today's date.

Jane quit her job on 03/20/2020, and 176 days have passed since then. 

To find today's date, we can add the 176 days to 03/20/2020.

176 days is equal to 24 weeks and 2 days. 

So we can add 24 weeks to 03/20/2020, which is 09/18/2020. Then we add 2 days to 09/18/2020, which is 09/20/2020.

So today's date is 09/20/2020.

Now, to find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from 09/20/2020.

One year ago from 09/20/2020 is 09/20/2019.

The answer is {09/20/2019}."
94,"Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?","To find the date one week ago from today, we first need to find today's date.

Jane quit her job on 03/20/2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To find today's today's date, we can add 176 days to 03/20/2020.

Since there are 30 days in March, April, June, September, and November, and 31 days in January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, we can calculate the number of days in each month as follows:

- March: 20 days (already given)
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days
- October: 31 days
- November: 30 days
- December: 31 days

Now, let's add the days:
- March: 20 days
- April: 20 + 30 = 50 days
- May: 50 + 31 = 81 days
- June: 81 + 30 = 111 days
- July: 111 + 31 = 142 days
- August: 142 + 31 = 173 days
- September: 173 + 30 = 203 days
- October: 203 + 31 = 234 days
- November: 234 + 30 = 264 days
- December: 264 + 31 = 295 days

Since 176 days have passed, we need to subtract 295 - 176 = 119 days from the last day of December (12/31/2020) to find the current date.

Now, let's subtract 119 days from 12/31/2020:
- December: 31 - 31 = 0 days
- November: 0 - 30 = -30 days (which is 30 days in November, so we need to go back to October)
- October: 30 - 31 = -1 day (which is 31 days in October, so we need to go back to September)
- September: 30 - 30 = 0 days
- August: 0 - 31 = -31 days (which is 31 days in August, so we need to go back to July)
- July: 30 - 31 = -1 day (which is 31 days in July, so we need to go back to June)
- June: 30 - 30 = 0 days
- May: 0 - 31 = -31 days (which is 31 days in May, so we need to go back to April)
- April: 30 - 30 = 0 days
- March: 0 - 20 = -20 days (which is 20 days in March, so we need to go back to February)

Since we need to go back to February, we need to add 29 days to 02/28/2020 (since 2020 is a leap year). However, we only need to add 9 days to 02/28/2020 (29 - 20 = 9).

Now, let's add 9 days to 02/28/2020:
- February: 28 + 9 = 37 days (which is 29 days in February, so we need to go back to January)
- January: 37 - 31 = 6 days

So, the current date is 01/06/2020.

Now, let's find the date one week ago from today (01/06/2020):
- January: 6 - 7 = -1 day (which is 7 days in January, so we need to go back to December)
- December: 31 - 1 = 30 days

So, the date one week ago from today is 12/30/2019.

The answer is {12/30/2019}."

158,"Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Since today is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower, it means she saw the meteor shower for the first time in 1973. The problem doesn't specify the exact date of the meteor shower occurred, so we can assume it occurred on any date in 1973.

However, the problem states that today is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower, which implies that today is also in 1973. 

Since today is 3/5, we can assume that today is March 5, 1973.

The answer is {03/05/1973}."

Jane saw a meteor shower for the first time in 1973, so that must be on the first day of 1973, which is 01/01/1973.
So today is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower, which is 365 days after 01/01/1973.
Since 365 days is equal to 52 weeks and 1 day, today is 01/01/1973 + 52 weeks + 1 day = 01/01/1973 + 365 days = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 01/01/1974 - 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day = 12/31/1973 + 1 day"

Since the meteor shower was the first time this year, it must have occurred before today.
The first time Jane saw the meteor shower was before 03/05/1973.
Since the meteor shower is a seasonal event, it is likely that it occurred in the fall of 1972.
The first time Jane saw the meteor shower was before 03/05/1973, so it must have been in the fall of 1972.
Let's assume the meteor shower occurred in November 1972, which is a common month for meteor showers.
If the meteor shower occurred on 11/15/1972, then 10 days ago would be 11/05/1972.
However, this is not the correct answer, as 11/05/1972 is before the first day of November.
Let's try again. If the meteor shower occurred on 11/22/1972, then 10 days ago would be 11/12/1972.
However, this is not the correct answer, as 11/12/1972 is also before the first day of November.

07/10/1972 - 1 day = 07/09/1972
07/09/1972 - 1 day = 07/08/1972
07/08/1972 - 1 day = 07/07/1972
07/07/1972 - 1 day = 07/06/1972
07/06/1972 - 1 day = 07/05/1972
07/05/1972 - 1 day = 07/04/1972
