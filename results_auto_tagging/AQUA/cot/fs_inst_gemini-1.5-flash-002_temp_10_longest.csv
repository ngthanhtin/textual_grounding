0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","Let the height of the tower be h.
Let the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower be x.
At the initial point, the angle of elevation is 45°.  So we have:
tan(45°) = h/x  =>  1 = h/x  =>  x = h

After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation is 60°. Let the distance traveled in 10 minutes be d. The new distance from the base of the tower is x - d = h - d.
So we have:
tan(60°) = h/(h - d)  =>  √3 = h/(h - d)
h - d = h/√3
d = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3

The car is traveling at a uniform speed. Let the speed be v.  The distance d is covered in 10 minutes.
d = v * 10 minutes
h(√3 - 1)/√3 = v * 10

We want to find the time it takes to cover the remaining distance (h - d).  This remaining distance is:
h - d = h - h(√3 - 1)/√3 = h(1 - (√3 - 1)/√3) = h(√3 - √3 + 1)/√3 = h/√3

The time t it takes to cover this distance is:
t = (h/√3) / v
We know h(√3 - 1)/√3 = 10v, so h/v = 10√3/(√3 - 1)
Substituting this into the equation for t:
t = (10√3/(√3 - 1)) * (1/√3) = 10/(√3 - 1)
To rationalize the denominator:
t = 10(√3 + 1)/((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1)) = 10(√3 + 1)/(3 - 1) = 10(√3 + 1)/2 = 5(√3 + 1) minutes

Therefore, it will take 5(√3 + 1) more minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Answer: {A)5(√3 + 1)}

1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
# Answer option: ['A)$61', 'B)$65', 'C)$67.40', 'D)$70', 'E)$78.20']","Let the original price of the item be P.
The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78P.
The customer uses a $20 coupon, so the final price is 0.78P - $20.
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the final price is 0.5P + $1.90.
Therefore, we have the equation:
0.78P - $20 = 0.5P + $1.90
Subtract 0.5P from both sides:
0.28P - $20 = $1.90
Add $20 to both sides:
0.28P = $21.90
Divide by 0.28:
P = $21.90 / 0.28 
P = $78.20

2,"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?
# Answer option: ['A)36', 'B)15', 'C)17', 'D)5', 'E)7']","To find a multiple of X that is divisible by both 9 and 12, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12.

The prime factorization of 9 is 3 x 3 = 3².
The prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3 = 2² x 3.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations:
LCM(9, 12) = 2² x 3² = 4 x 9 = 36

Therefore, any multiple of 36 will be divisible by both 9 and 12.  The only option that is a multiple of 36 is 36 itself.

3,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
# Answer option: ['A)0.22', 'B)0.26', 'C)0.37', 'D)0.46', 'E)0.63']","Let A be the event that Stock A increases in value during the next month, and B be the event that Stock B increases in value during the next month.
We are given that P(A) = 0.56 and P(B) = 0.74.
We want to find the greatest value for the probability that neither A nor B will occur. This is equivalent to finding P(A' ∩ B'), where A' and B' are the complements of A and B, respectively.

Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

We also know that:
P(A' ∩ B') = 1 - P(A ∪ B)

The minimum value of P(A ∩ B) is max(0, P(A) + P(B) - 1).
In this case, max(0, 0.56 + 0.74 - 1) = max(0, 0.3) = 0.3

The maximum value of P(A ∪ B) is min(1, P(A) + P(B)) = min(1, 0.56 + 0.74) = min(1, 1.3) = 1

Therefore, the minimum value of P(A ∪ B) is 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.3 = 1
And the maximum value of P(A ∪ B) is min(1, 0.56 + 0.74) = 1
Then P(A' ∩ B') = 1 - P(A ∪ B) = 1 - 1 = 0  (This is wrong. This case assumes the events are perfectly correlated. However, the problem doesn't state this.)

Let's consider the case where the events are independent.  Then P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) = 0.56 * 0.74 = 0.4144
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144 = 0.8856
P(A' ∩ B') = 1 - P(A ∪ B) = 1 - 0.8856 = 0.1144

However, we are looking for the greatest possible value of P(A' ∩ B').  This will occur when the events are as independent as possible.
The minimum value for P(A∪B) is max(P(A), P(B)) = 0.74
Therefore, the greatest value for P(A'∩B') = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

4,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
# Answer option: ['A)270', 'B)300', 'C)280', 'D)320', 'E)315']","Let the cost price of the article be CP.
The selling price (SP) is given as Rs. 360.
The profit percentage is 20%.
Profit = SP - CP
Profit percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100
20 = ((360 - CP) / CP) * 100
20CP = 36000 - 100CP
120CP = 36000
CP = 36000 / 120
CP = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

5,"20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
# Answer option: ['A)40', 'B)200', 'C)380', 'D)400', 'E)3200']","Let's denote the total number of marbles in the bag initially as 'x'.

After the first draw, 20 marbles are painted black and returned. So there are now 20 black marbles and (x - 20) white marbles.  The total number of marbles is still x.

The second time, 20 marbles are drawn, and 1 is black. This means the probability of drawing a black marble is 1/20.  We can set up a proportion to represent the percentage of black marbles in the bag:

(Number of black marbles) / (Total number of marbles) = (Number of black marbles drawn) / (Total number of marbles drawn)

20 / x = 1 / 20

Cross-multiplying gives:

20 * 20 = 1 * x
400 = x

Therefore, there are 400 marbles in the bag.

6,"Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
# Answer option: ['A)74453', 'B)64543', 'C)74325', 'D)65000', 'E)97656']","Let's break down the problem:

1. **Letters:** There are 26 letters in the alphabet.  Since we need two letters, and the order matters (e.g., ""AB"" is different from ""BA""), we have 26 choices for the first letter and 26 choices for the second. This gives us 26 * 26 = 676 possible letter combinations.

2. **Numbers:** We have 10 digits (0-9).  Since we need two numbers, and the order matters, we have 10 choices for the first digit and 10 choices for the second. This gives us 10 * 10 = 100 possible number combinations.

3. **Total Combinations:** To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations: 676 * 100 = 67600

The question asks about distinct bike numbers.  The provided answer options are far larger than 67600. There's a discrepancy.  It's possible the question intended to have a larger set of characters for letters (e.g., including numbers or special characters), or there is some additional constraint not specified (like no repeating digits).


Therefore, based on a standard alphabet and digits 0-9 with no repeating digits, the answer would be 67,600, which isn't among the choices. We need to check if there's a mistake in the question or the answer choices.

# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)11.5', 'C)12.5', 'D)13.5', 'E)15']","Here's how to solve the train problem:

**1. Find the total distance:**

* The train travels at 100 mph for 10 hours, so the total distance is 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles.

**2. Find the distance covered before the rain:**

* The train covers a quarter of the distance before the rain starts, so that's 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles.

**3. Find the time taken before the rain:**

* Time = Distance / Speed = 250 miles / 100 mph = 2.5 hours.

**4. Find the remaining distance:**

* The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.

**5. Find the time taken in the rain:**

* Time = Distance / Speed = 750 miles / 75 mph = 10 hours.

**6. Find the total journey duration:**

* Total time = Time before rain + Time in rain = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.

8,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?
# Answer option: ['A)27', 'B)81', 'C)90', 'D)99', 'E)110']","Let P be the number of students who attended the prom night, and D be the number of students who took part in the debating session.
Total number of students = 200
At least 45% attended the prom night, so P ≥ 0.45 * 200 = 90
At least 35% took part in the debating session, so D ≥ 0.35 * 200 = 70

Let's find the minimum number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both.  The minimum number of students attending either event is the sum of the minimum number attending each event, minus the maximum number attending both (since we've double counted those students):

Minimum (P ∪ D) = Minimum(P) + Minimum(D) - Maximum(P ∩ D)

We want to maximize the number of students who attended neither event. This means we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event. To minimize P ∪ D, we need to maximize P ∩ D.

The maximum number of students who could have attended both is the minimum of the two: min(90, 70) = 70.

Therefore, the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is:

Minimum (P ∪ D) = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90

The maximum number of students who could have attended neither event is the total number of students minus the minimum number who attended at least one event:

Maximum (neither) = 200 - 90 = 110

9,"A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)24', 'C)25', 'D)40', 'E)52']","Let x be the number of sales the salesperson makes.
Each sale is $250, and the commission is 10%, so the commission per sale is 0.10 * $250 = $25.
The total commission earned from x sales is 25x.
The salesperson wants to earn at least $1000, so we have the inequality:
25x >= 1000
To find x, we divide both sides by 25:
x >= 1000 / 25
x >= 40
Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 40 sales to reach a salary of at least $1000.

10,"A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
# Answer option: ['A)226', 'B)230', 'C)240', 'D)260', 'E)280']","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the total annual production cost:**

* Monthly production: 420 units
* Monthly production cost per unit: $110
* Total monthly production cost: 420 units * $110/unit = $46,200
* Total annual production cost: $46,200/month * 12 months/year = $554,400

**2. Determine the required annual revenue:**

* Desired annual profit: $626,400
* Total annual production cost: $554,400
* Required annual revenue: $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800

**3. Calculate the minimum selling price per component:**

* Total annual revenue: $1,180,800
* Total annual units produced: 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5040 units
* Minimum selling price per unit: $1,180,800 / 5040 units = $234/unit

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the desired yearly profit is $234.  However, this answer is not among the choices. Let's re-examine the calculations.

There might be a slight error in the problem statement or the answer choices.  Let's check the calculations again. The annual production cost is indeed $554,400. The required annual revenue is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.  The number of units produced annually is 5040.  Therefore, the minimum selling price is $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.

Since 234 is not an option, there must be an error in the provided answer choices.  The closest option is 230.

Scenario 1: You walk 20 steps and then the elevator takes you to the bottom in 10 minutes.  This means the elevator travels (y - 20) steps in 10 minutes.  Therefore, we have the equation:

(y - 20) = 10x

Scenario 2: You walk 10 steps and the elevator takes you to the bottom in 20 minutes. This means the elevator travels (y - 10) steps in 20 minutes.  Therefore, we have the equation:

# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)16', 'C)17', 'D)18', 'E)19']","Let A be the number of toys Alex made and J be the number of toys Jacob made.
We know that A + J = 35.

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total time Alex spent is 7A hours.
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total time Jacob spent is 9J hours.

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can assume 7A ≈ 9J.
We have two equations:
1) A + J = 35
2) 7A ≈ 9J

From equation (1), A = 35 - J.  Substitute this into equation (2):
7(35 - J) ≈ 9J
245 - 7J ≈ 9J

J ≈ 245/16 ≈ 15.31

Since the number of toys must be a whole number, we can round J to the nearest whole number, which is 15.
Then, A = 35 - 15 = 20.

Let's check the hours:
Alex: 7 * 20 = 140 hours
Jacob: 9 * 15 = 135 hours

The hours are quite close.  Let's try J=16:
A = 35 - 16 = 19
Alex hours: 7 * 19 = 133
Jacob hours: 9 * 16 = 144

The difference is still relatively small.  However, 15 is closer to the approximate solution we got initially.

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
# Answer option: ['A)15.38%', 'B)42%', 'C)39.86%', 'D)22.35%', 'E)32.51%']","Let's break down the tea concentration step-by-step.

**Step 1:** John starts with a 50% tea solution.  This means 50% is tea, and 50% is milk.

**Step 2:** He replaces 15% of the solution with milk.  This means he removes 15% of the original 500ml and replaces it with pure milk.
* Tea remaining: 50% - (15% of 50%) = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%
* Milk: 50% + 7.5% = 57.5%

**Step 3:** He repeats Step 2.  He again removes 15% of the *new* solution and replaces it with milk.
* Tea remaining: 42.5% - (15% of 42.5%) = 42.5% - 6.375% = 36.125%
* Milk: 57.5% + 6.375% = 63.875%

**Step 4:** He replaces 10% of the resultant solution (from Step 3) with milk.
* Tea remaining: 36.125% - (10% of 36.125%) = 36.125% - 3.6125% = 32.5125%
* Milk: 63.875% + 3.6125% = 67.4875%

Therefore, the final concentration of tea is approximately 32.51%.

We are given that:
M = T/16
B = T/10
E = T/8

The total number of students studying math, bio, and English is M + B + E.  Since each student can only study one subject, M, B, and E must be integers.  Therefore, T must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8.

The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, so the selling price is C + 0.40C = 1.40C.
The gross profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is 1.40C - C = 0.40C.
We are given that the gross profit is $20.00, so 0.40C = $20.00.
To find the cost C, we divide both sides by 0.40:

32,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
# Answer option: ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']","Let the length and width of the rectangular sheet be L and W respectively.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm.  This means the length remains L, and the width becomes W/2. The perimeter is then given by:

2 * (L + W/2) = 48
L + W/2 = 24
2L + W = 48  (Equation 1)

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. This means the width remains W, and the length becomes L/2. The perimeter is then given by:

2 * (W + L/2) = 66
W + L/2 = 33
2W + L = 66  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

2L + W = 48
L + 2W = 66

We can solve this system of equations.  Let's multiply the second equation by 2:

2L + 4W = 132

Now subtract the first equation from this new equation:

(2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 132 - 48
3W = 84
W = 28

Substitute W = 28 into Equation 1:

2L + 28 = 48
2L = 20
L = 10

Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is:

Area = L * W = 10 * 28 = 280 cm²

However, this answer is not among the choices. Let's re-examine the problem statement. The perimeter is 48 for one fold and 66 for the other fold.  Let's use the dimensions directly.  The perimeter of the half sheet when folded one way is 48, implying that one side is doubled and it's 24. The other way it is 33, implying the other side is doubled to 33, making the total perimeter 2(24+33) = 114 which is not correct.

Let's reconsider the equations.  When folded one way, we have:
L + W/2 = 24  =>  2L + W = 48
When folded the other way:
W + L/2 = 33  => L + 2W = 66

Multiply the first equation by 2: 4L + 2W = 96
Subtract the second equation: 3L = 30  => L = 10
Substitute into the second equation: 10 + 2W = 66  => 2W = 56  => W = 28

Area = LW = 10 * 28 = 280.  This is still not in the options. There must be a misunderstanding of the problem statement.


Let's assume the problem meant the perimeter of each *half* sheet is 48 and 66 respectively.

Then:
L + W/2 = 24   =>   W = 48 - 2L
L/2 + W = 33   =>   L + 2W = 66

Substitute: L + 2(48 - 2L) = 66
L + 96 - 4L = 66
-3L = -30
L = 10
W = 48 - 2(10) = 28

Area = 10 * 28 = 280.  Still not in options. There's an error in either the problem statement or the answer choices.

**1. Find the distance from the center of the rectangular solid to one of its vertices.**

Imagine the rectangular solid centered at the origin of a 3D coordinate system.  The vertices would be located at (±1.5, ±2, ±7.5)  (half the dimensions of the rectangular solid).

The distance from the center (0,0,0) to a vertex (1.5, 2, 7.5)  can be found using the distance formula in three dimensions:

d = √[(1.5)² + 2² + (7.5)²] = √(2.25 + 4 + 56.25) = √62.5 ≈ 7.906

**2. Recognize that this distance is the radius of the sphere.**

Since all eight vertices of the rectangular solid lie on the sphere, the distance from the center of the solid to any vertex is the radius of the circumscribing sphere.

**3. Calculate the diameter.**

The diameter is twice the radius:

Diameter = 2 * 7.906 ≈ 15.812

The student was supposed to find 7/8 of x, which is (7/8)x.
Instead, the student found 7/18 of x, which is (7/18)x.
The difference between the actual value and the student's answer is given as 770.

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
To solve for x, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:
The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.
So we rewrite the equation as:

# Answer option: ['A)10,8', 'B)9,8', 'C)7,8', 'D)5,6', 'E)11,12']","Let's say Jack bought 'x' white sharpeners and 'y' brown sharpeners.
We know that x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners)
Let the cost of a brown sharpener be 'p' rupees.  Then the cost of a white sharpener is 'p + 1' rupees.
The total cost is 100 rupees, so we can write the equation:
x(p + 1) + yp = 100

We have a system of two equations with three unknowns (x, y, p).  We need to solve for x and y. Let's try to solve this using substitution.

From the first equation, we can express y as: y = 18 - x

Substitute this into the second equation:
x(p + 1) + (18 - x)p = 100
xp + x + 18p - xp = 100
x + 18p = 100
x = 100 - 18p

Since x represents the number of white sharpeners, it must be a positive integer.  Let's test integer values of 'p':

If p = 1, x = 100 - 18(1) = 82 (Too high)
If p = 2, x = 100 - 18(2) = 64 (Too high)
If p = 3, x = 100 - 18(3) = 46 (Too high)
If p = 4, x = 100 - 18(4) = 28 (Too high)
If p = 5, x = 100 - 18(5) = 10  This works!

If x = 10, then y = 18 - 10 = 8

Let's check if this solution satisfies the cost equation:
10(5 + 1) + 8(5) = 60 + 40 = 100  This is correct!

Therefore, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)15', 'C)12', 'D)6', 'E)3']","Let the volume of the pool be V.
Hose A fills the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is V/8 per hour.
Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2 * (V/8) = V/4 of the pool.
The remaining volume is V - V/4 = 3V/4.
Hoses A and B together finished filling the remaining 3V/4 in 3 hours.
Their combined rate is (3V/4) / 3 = V/4 per hour.
Let the rate of hose B be r. Then the combined rate of A and B is (V/8) + r = V/4.

45,"If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000?
# Answer option: ['A)81900', 'B)85995', 'C)85800', 'D)90000', 'E)None of these']","Here's how to solve the population growth problem:

**1. Calculate the population after the first year:**

* Increase = 5% of 78000 = (5/100) * 78000 = 3900
* Population after 1 year = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

**2. Calculate the population after the second year:**

* Increase = 5% of 81900 = (5/100) * 81900 = 4095
* Population after 2 years = 81900 + 4095 = 85995

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years' time will be 85,995.

46,"Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet?
# Answer option: ['A) 1', 'B) 1.25', 'C) 1.50', 'D) 1.75', 'E) 2']","Let the distance of the highway be D = 50 miles.
Let the speed of the first car be v1 = 12 mph.
Let the speed of the second car be v2 = 13 mph.
Let the time they meet be t hours.

The distance covered by the first car is d1 = v1 * t = 12t miles.
The distance covered by the second car is d2 = v2 * t = 13t miles.

When they meet, the sum of the distances covered by both cars is equal to the total distance of the highway.
Therefore, d1 + d2 = D
12t + 13t = 50

47,"A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
# Answer option: ['A)30000', 'B)415000', 'C)31500', 'D)50000', 'E)None of these']","Let the monthly salary of the servant be S = 1500.
Let the commission rate be C = 15% = 0.15.
Let the monthly sale be x.
The commission earned on the monthly sale is Cx = 0.15x.
The total monthly income of the servant is the sum of the salary and the commission:
Total income = S + Cx = 1500 + 0.15x
The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.  Therefore, we set up the equation:
1500 + 0.15x = 6000
Subtract 1500 from both sides:
0.15x = 6000 - 1500
0.15x = 4500
Divide both sides by 0.15:
x = 4500 / 0.15
x = 30000

Therefore, the servant should make a monthly sale of 30000 Rupees to have a monthly income of 6000 Rupees.

# Answer option: ['A)1.5%', 'B)4.5%', 'C)10%', 'D)5%', 'E)12%']","Here's how to solve the interest rate problem:

**1. Calculate the total amount repaid:**

* Total repaid = 12 installments * Rs. 31.50/installment = Rs. 378

**2. Calculate the total interest paid:**

* Total interest = Total repaid - Principal amount = Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18

**3. Calculate the simple interest rate per year:**

Simple interest is calculated as:  (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

We know:

* Principal (P) = Rs. 360
* Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 18
* Time (T) = 1 year (since it's paid in 12 monthly installments)

Let's solve for the rate (R):

18 = (360 * R * 1) / 100
1800 = 360 * R
R = 1800 / 360
R = 5

Therefore, the simple interest rate is 5%.

The total value of the 25 paise coins is x * 0.25 rupees.
The total value of the 50 paise coins is x * 0.50 rupees.
The total value of the 1 rupee coins is x * 1.00 rupees.

The total value of all coins is 700 rupees.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

56,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
# Answer option: ['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']","The hollow cube has an outer side length of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm. This means the inner side length is 5 cm - 2(1 cm) = 3 cm.

The number of small cubes in the outer surface is (5^3).  However, this includes the inner cubes, which aren't painted.  So we must subtract the inner cubes.

The total number of small cubes is 5 x 5 x 5 = 125.
The number of small cubes in the inner cube is 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.
The number of small cubes in the outer shell is 125 - 27 = 98.


Each small cube has 6 faces.  If a small cube is on the exterior surface, at least one face is painted.

Let's consider the number of unpainted faces.  The inner 3x3x3 cube has 27 small cubes. Each of these has 6 faces.  Total faces = 27 * 6 = 162 faces.

The cubes on the interior only have unpainted faces. The number of unpainted faces is 6*27 - (number of faces touching painted faces).

The inner 3x3x3 cube has 27 cubes.  Each of the inner cubes has 6 faces.  A total of 27 * 6 = 162 faces are inside the outer cube.  However, some of these inner faces touch outer cubes.


Let's count unpainted faces:

* Inner 3x3x3 cube:  The inner cube has 27 small cubes.  Each has 6 faces.  The total number of faces is 27 * 6 = 162.
* Faces touching painted faces:  Let's consider faces of inner cubes touching outer painted faces:  There are 3 x 3 = 9 faces at each end of the inner 3 x 3 x 3 cube, for a total of 18 faces at each end. The total number of faces touched by painted ones is 18*3 = 54 (from inner cube).

The remaining faces are unpainted. Thus 162 - 54 = 108 faces on the inner 3x3x3 are unpainted.

However, we can also think of it this way: each of the 27 interior small cubes has 6 faces, so there are 27 * 6 = 162 total faces.  The faces that are touching the outside are the ones that are painted. These are 6 x 3 x 3 = 54 faces.

Thus, the number of unpainted faces is 162 - (6*9 + 6*9 + 6*9) = 162 - 54 = 108.

Let's consider the small cubes on the faces.  Each face of the large cube has 25 - 9 = 16 small cubes.  There are 6 faces, so that's 16 * 6 = 96 small cubes.  Each has 6 faces, so that's 576 faces.

Total faces: 125 cubes * 6 faces/cube = 750 faces.
Painted faces: at least one face painted on the exterior cubes. The number of cubes is 125 - 27 = 98.  So minimum painted faces is 98.
Unpainted faces: 750 - 98 = 652

The number of unpainted faces is 486.

# Answer option: ['A)47', 'B)91', 'C)41', 'D)67', 'E)44']","Let the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers be n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8.  Their sum is:

5n + 20

When this sum is divided by 10, we get:

(5n + 20) / 10 = (n + 4) / 2

This expression must be a perfect square. Let's denote the perfect square as k². Then:

(n + 4) / 2 = k²

n + 4 = 2k²

n = 2k² - 4

Since n is a two-digit odd number, we can test values of k:

* If k = 1, n = -2 (not a two-digit number)
* If k = 2, n = 4
* If k = 3, n = 14
* If k = 4, n = 28
* If k = 5, n = 46
* If k = 6, n = 68
* If k = 7, n = 94

The consecutive odd numbers would be:

If n = 14: 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 (Not all odd)
If n = 46: 47, 49, 51, 53, 55  (Sum = 255, 255/10 = 25.5, not a perfect square)
If n = 94: This would create numbers above 100


Let's re-examine the condition: (n+4)/2 = k².  This means n+4 must be an even number divisible by 2.  And n must be an even number. But the problem states that n is an odd number. There must be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding of it.

Let's try a different approach. Let's assume the five consecutive odd numbers are x-8, x-6, x-4, x-2, x. Their sum is 5x - 20. Dividing by 10 gives (5x-20)/10 = (x-4)/2.  This must be a perfect square, say k^2.  Then x-4 = 2k^2, and x = 2k^2 + 4. Since x must be odd, this is not possible.  There's an error in the problem statement.


Let's check the answer choices. If we assume there's a minor error, and the numbers don't have to be consecutive odd, let's try the options.

A) 47: No clear pattern to find other numbers to create a perfect square.
B) 91: No clear pattern.
C) 41: No clear pattern.
D) 67: No clear pattern.
E) 44: Not an odd number.

The problem statement is flawed.  There's no solution that satisfies the conditions as stated.

# Answer option: ['A)850', 'B)800', 'C)900', 'D)950', 'E)1000']","Let the total number of students in the class be 'x'.
Students interested in Football = 8% of x = 0.08x
Students interested in Cricket = (4/5)x = 0.8x
Students interested in Basketball = 10% of x = 0.1x
Students not interested in any games = 20

The sum of students interested in different games and those not interested in any game equals the total number of students:

0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x

Combining the terms with 'x':

0.98x + 20 = x

Subtracting 0.98x from both sides:

20 = x - 0.98x
20 = 0.02x

# Answer option: ['A)22', 'B)27', 'C)29', 'D)Cannot be determined', 'E)None of the above']","Let R's age be R, Q's age be Q, and T's age be T.
We are given that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.  This can be expressed as:

R - Q = Q - T

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50:

R + T = 50

We want to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q.

From the first equation, we can solve for R:

R = 2Q - T

Substitute this into the second equation:

(2Q - T) + T = 50

2Q = 50

Q = 25

Now substitute Q = 25 back into the equation R = 2Q - T:

R = 2(25) - T = 50 - T

Since R + T = 50, we can solve for R in terms of T:  R = 50 - T.

We know that R - Q = Q - T.  Substituting Q = 25, we have:

R - 25 = 25 - T

R = 50 - T

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is:

R - Q = (50 - T) - 25 = 25 - T

We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of T (and thus R) which means we cannot definitively determine the difference between R and Q's age.

# Answer option: ['A)3', 'B)4', 'C)5', 'D)10', 'E)20']","Here's how to solve this problem:

Amy has 10 types of books to code.  She can use single letters or pairs of letters.

* **Single letters:** She can use at most 26 single letters (the number of letters in the alphabet).

* **Pairs of letters:** The number of pairs she can make with *n* letters is  n(n-1)/2  (because the order doesn't matter and you can't use the same letter twice in a pair).

Let's try using single letters first to minimize the number of letters:


* If she uses 3 letters, she has 3 single letter codes and 3(3-1)/2 = 3 pairs.  That is 3 + 3 = 6 codes.
* If she uses 4 letters, she has 4 single letter codes and 4(4-1)/2 = 6 pairs. That is 4+6 = 10 codes.

The length is given as 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, so the length is (4b + 1) meters.
The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m.  Therefore:
b * (4b + 1) = 150
4b² + b - 150 = 0
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula or factoring.  Factoring is easier in this case:
(4b + 25)(b - 6) = 0
This gives two possible solutions for b: b = 6 or b = -25/4. Since breadth cannot be negative, we have b = 6 meters.
The length is 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25 meters.

69,"Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
# Answer option: ['A)12/25', 'B)3/2', 'C)3', 'D)2', 'E)25/3']","Let's use variables to represent the amount of falafel:

* Let P represent the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
* Let R represent the amount of falafel in one roll.
* Let B represent the amount of falafel in one baguette.

We are given the following relationships:

* 6P = 2R  (Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls)
* 3R = 5B  (Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes)

We want to find the relationship between B and P (how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes).

First, let's solve for R in terms of P from the first equation:

6P = 2R
R = 3P

Now, substitute this value of R into the second equation:

3(3P) = 5B
9P = 5B

Now we want to find how many pita breads (xP) are equal to two baguettes (2B):

xP = 2B

We can solve for x by using the equation 9P = 5B:

B = (9/5)P

Substitute this into xP = 2B:

xP = 2 * (9/5)P
xP = (18/5)P
x = 18/5

Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.  This simplifies to 3 and 3/5 pita breads. However, this answer isn't among the choices. Let's check our work.

From 6P = 2R, we get R = 3P.
From 3R = 5B, substituting R = 3P, we get 9P = 5B.
We want to find x such that xP = 2B.
From 9P = 5B, we get B = (9/5)P.
Substituting into xP = 2B, we have xP = 2(9/5)P, so x = 18/5.

There must be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices.  Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The question is: Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?

We found that 9P = 5B, so B = (9/5)P.  Then 2B = 2(9/5)P = 18P/5 = 3.6P.  This means 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.  None of the answer choices match this.  There's an error in either the question or the answer choices provided.

70,"A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original?
# Answer option: ['A)21%', 'B)20%', 'C)25%', 'D)33%', 'E)18%']","Let the original price be P.
The shopkeeper gives a 20% discount, so the discounted price is P - 0.20P = 0.80P.
To return to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the discounted price by an amount x such that 0.80P + x = P.
Solving for x:  x = P - 0.80P = 0.20P
The percentage increase is calculated as (increase / discounted price) * 100%.
Percentage increase = (0.20P / 0.80P) * 100% = (0.20 / 0.80) * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25%

# Answer option: ['A)126', 'B)77', 'C)88', 'D)66', 'E)54']","Let B be the bus fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh.
Let T be the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh.
The bus fare for two persons is 2B.
We are given that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person.  Therefore:
2B = (4/3)T

Six persons travel by bus, so the total bus fare is 6B.
Eight persons travel by train, so the total train fare is 8T.
The total fare paid is Rs. 1512.  Therefore:
6B + 8T = 1512

We have a system of two equations with two variables:
1) 2B = (4/3)T
2) 6B + 8T = 1512

From equation (1), we can solve for B in terms of T:
B = (4/3)T / 2 = (2/3)T

Substitute this value of B into equation (2):
6 * ((2/3)T) + 8T = 1512
4T + 8T = 1512
12T = 1512
T = 1512 / 12
T = 126

Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs. 126.

# Answer option: ['A)238', 'B)289', 'C)200', 'D)287', 'E)187']","Let the speed of the ship be 's' miles per hour.
The speed of the plane is 10s miles per hour.
The ship traveled 180 miles before the plane started.
Let 't' be the time (in hours) it takes for the plane to meet the ship after the plane starts.
In time 't', the ship travels a distance of s*t miles.
In time 't', the plane travels a distance of 10s*t miles.
When they meet, the total distance traveled by the ship and plane is equal to the total distance of the voyage.  The ship's starting position is 180 miles from the starting point.

Therefore, the equation is:  180 + s*t + 10s*t = total distance

However, we are given that the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship and starts 180 miles behind.

Let's use a different approach. Let x be the distance the ship travels from the time the plane takes off.  The plane will travel 10x.   The total distance is 180 + x + 10x = 180 + 11x.  This represents the total distance traveled when they meet.

However, we don't know the total distance of the voyage.  Let's consider the relative speed.  The plane is approaching the ship at a relative speed of 10s - s = 9s miles per hour.

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts.  The distance the plane needs to cover to catch the ship is 180 miles.  The time it takes is distance/relative speed = 180 / 9s.  In this time, the ship travels an additional 180/9 = 20 miles.

Therefore, the distance from the starting point where they meet is 180 + 20 = 200 miles.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
# Answer option: ['A)300', 'B)500', 'C)5000', 'D)6000', 'E)7500']","Let N be the total deer population in the forest.
In 2001, 300 deer were tagged.
In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and 20 of them had tags.
The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is 20/500 = 0.04.
We assume this proportion is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire forest.
The number of tagged deer in the forest is 300.
The proportion of tagged deer in the forest is 300/N.

77,"In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
# Answer option: ['A)0.9', 'B)0.8', 'C)0.6', 'D)0.65', 'E)1.5']","The main line train arrives every 10 minutes, starting at 5:00 AM.
The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes, starting at 5:02 AM.

Let's consider the arrival times of the trains in the first few minutes:

Main line: 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, ...
Harbor line: 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, ...

The man arrives at a random time.  Let's assume the man arrives uniformly at random within any 10-minute interval.


If the man arrives between 5:00 and 5:02, the first train to arrive is the main line train.  This is a 2-minute window.
If the man arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, the first train to arrive is the harbor line train. This is an 8-minute window.
If the man arrives between 5:10 and 5:12, the first train to arrive is the main line train. This is a 2-minute window.
If the man arrives between 5:12 and 5:20, the first train to arrive is the harbor line train.  This is an 8-minute window.
And this pattern continues.


Within a 12-minute cycle (the least common multiple of 2 and 10 is 10 but it is not 2 minutes between trains), there are 2 minutes where the main line train arrives first and 8 minutes where the harbor line train arrives first and 2 minutes when they arrive together.  Therefore, in any given 12 minute cycle, there are 10 minutes when the main line train arrives before the harbor line train.
The probability that the man catches the first train of the main line is 10/12 = 5/6.

The probability of the man catching the main line train first is 10/12 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833
The probability of the man catching the harbor line train first is 2/12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167

The question asks for the probability of catching *the first* train, which means either the main line or the harbor line train.  This should be 1, since he will always catch the first train that arrives.  However, given the options this is not possible, the question is ambiguous.  Let's assume the question asks for the probability of catching the main line train first.

79,"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
# Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']","Let P be the population of Boomtown one year ago.
After one year, the population increases by 10%, so the population becomes P + 0.10P = 1.10P.
After two years, the population increases by another 10%, so the population becomes 1.10P + 0.10(1.10P) = 1.10P(1 + 0.10) = 1.10P * 1.10 = 1.21P.
The problem states that the population two years from now (1.21P) is double the population one year ago (P).  This is incorrect; there's a discrepancy in the problem statement.  The statement ""the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago"" is not consistent with a 10% annual increase.

Let's assume the problem meant to say that the population two years from now would be *approximately* double the population one year ago.  Then we can solve for the approximate percentage increase from one year ago to now.

Let x be the percentage increase in population over the last year.
Then the population one year ago is P, and the current population is P(1 + x).
After one more year (next year) , the population will be P(1+x)(1+0.10)
Since the problem states that the population two years from now is approximately double that of one year ago, we can write the approximate equation :
P(1+x)(1.10) ≈ 2P
(1+x)(1.10) ≈ 2
1+x ≈ 2/1.10 ≈ 1.818
x ≈ 0.818
x ≈ 81.8%
This is not among the answer choices.


Let's re-examine the problem.  The statement ""the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago"" is the source of the contradiction. If this is true, then:

1.10 * 1.10 * P = 2P
1.21P = 2P
This equation is not possible unless P=0. There is a mistake in the question.

Let's assume the growth over the past year is x. Then this year's population is P(1+x). Next year it will be P(1+x)(1.1).
We are told that P(1+x)(1.1)=2P.
(1+x)(1.1)=2
1+x=2/1.1=1.818
x=0.818 or 81.8%

Scenario 1: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.
Arjun has A - 30
Sajal has S + 30
S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
S + 30 = 2A - 60
S = 2A - 90  (Equation 1)

Scenario 2: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.
Arjun has A + 10
Sajal has S - 10
A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
A + 10 = 3S - 30
A = 3S - 40  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
S = 2A - 90

We are given that gcd(a, b) = 11 and lcm(a, b) = 7700.
We are also given that one of the integers is 350, so let a = 350. We need to find b.

We know that for any two positive integers a and b, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the integers themselves. That is:
gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b

Substituting the given values, we have:
11 * 7700 = 350 * b
84700 = 350 * b
b = 84700 / 350
b = 242

Therefore, the other integer is 242.

We can verify this:
a = 350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7
b = 242 = 2 * 11^2
gcd(350, 242) = 2 * 11 = 22  (This is incorrect.  There's a mistake in the problem statement or our understanding of it. The GCD should be 11)

Let's reconsider the relationship between GCD and LCM.  We know that:
GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a * b

We are given GCD(a,b) = 11, LCM(a,b) = 7700, and a = 350.  Therefore:

11 * 7700 = 350 * b
84700 = 350b
b = 84700 / 350
b = 242

Let's check the GCD and LCM with a=350 and b=242:

350 = 2 * 5^2 * 7
242 = 2 * 11^2
GCD(350,242) = 2
LCM(350,242) = 2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11^2 = 42350.

# Answer option: ['A)56', 'B)58', 'C)60', 'D)62', 'E)64']","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Area of the rectangle:** Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, and together they form a rectangle.  Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 70 * 2 = 140 square feet.

2. **Dimensions of the rectangle:** Let the length of the untrimmed side of the square be 'x' feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle are x feet and (x - 4) feet.  The area of the rectangle is x(x - 4) = 140.

3. **Solving for x:** This gives us a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 140 = 0.  We can solve this using factoring or the quadratic formula. Factoring is easier in this case: (x - 14)(x + 10) = 0.  The two solutions are x = 14 and x = -10. Since length cannot be negative, x = 14 feet.

4. **Dimensions of the square:** The original square cloth had sides of 14 feet.

Given that M > N, we have 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a, which simplifies to 99a > 99c, so a > c.
We are given that M - N + 396c = 990.
Substituting the expressions for M and N, we get:
(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
99a + 297c = 990
Dividing by 99, we get:
a + 3c = 10
Since a and c are digits, and a > c, the possible pairs (a, c) are:
(7, 1), (8, 2/3), (9, 1/3)
If (a,c) = (7,1), then a+3c = 10.  b can be any digit from 0 to 9.  This gives 10 possibilities for M.
If (a,c) = (4,2), then a+3c = 10. b can be any digit from 0 to 9.  This gives 10 possibilities for M.
If (a,c) = (1,3), then a+3c = 10. b can be any digit from 0 to 9. This gives 10 possibilities for M.

However, we must have a > c.  Therefore, the only valid pairs are (7, 1), (4,2), (1,3) but a>c, so only (7,1) and (4,2) are valid.
For (a, c) = (7, 1), we have a + 3c = 7 + 3(1) = 10.  There are 10 possibilities for b (0-9).
For (a, c) = (4, 2), we have a + 3c = 4 + 3(2) = 10. There are 10 possibilities for b (0-9).
For (1,3) a<c so this pair is invalid.
Total possibilities for M are 10 + 10 = 20.
The question asks how many values of M are more than 300. All values of M generated from (7,1) and (4,2) are more than 300.  Hence there are 20 values of M.

86,"there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
# Answer option: ['A)550', 'B)570', 'C)600', 'D)700', 'E)none of these']","Let the total number of students in the school be 'x'.
The number of students who took physics is 20% of x, which is 0.20x.
The number of students who took math is 28% of x, which is 0.28x.
The total number of students who took either physics or math or both is 0.20x + 0.28x = 0.48x.  Since this is a percentage, it must be less than or equal to the total number of students (x).  There's no information to suggest that these are mutually exclusive (i.e., some students might have taken both).

We are given that x > 501.  We need to find the smallest integer x that satisfies this condition, and where both 0.20x and 0.28x are integers (since you can't have a fraction of a student).  This implies that x must be a multiple of both 5 (for 0.20x to be an integer) and of 25/7 (approximately 3.57) (for 0.28x to be an integer). To make both 0.20x and 0.28x integers, x needs to be a multiple of the least common multiple of 5 and 25/7.   This is not easily found directly, but testing values will work.

Let's test the given options:
A) 550: 0.20 * 550 = 110; 0.28 * 550 = 154.  Both are integers.
B) 570: 0.20 * 570 = 114; 0.28 * 570 = 159.6 (not an integer).
C) 600: 0.20 * 600 = 120; 0.28 * 600 = 168. Both are integers.
D) 700: 0.20 * 700 = 140; 0.28 * 700 = 196. Both are integers.

Since we are looking for the *least* possible number of students, and 550 is greater than 501, and both 0.20*550 and 0.28*550 are integers, 550 is the correct answer.

holidays. The bill for that month would be :
# Answer option: ['A)Rs.1560', 'B)Rs.1680', 'C)Rs.1840', 'D)Rs.1950', 'E)Rs.1690']","Let the fixed part of the telephone bill be F and the variable part be V.  The variable part depends on the number of calls (C).  We can express the total bill (B) as:

B = F + VC

We have two equations from the given information:

Equation 1: 1800 = F + 540V
Equation 2: 2040 = F + 620V

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:

240 = 80V
V = 3

Now, substitute V = 3 into Equation 1:

1800 = F + 540(3)
1800 = F + 1620
F = 180

So the equation for the telephone bill is:

B = 180 + 3C

# Answer option: ['A)1 hour and 31 minutes', 'B)2 hour and 31 minutes', 'C)3 hour and 31 minutes', 'D)4 hour and 31 minutes', 'E)5 hour and 31 minutes']","Here's how to solve the problem of finding when balls A and B will be at the same starting point again:

**1. Find the rotation rates:**

* **Ball A:** Completes 2 rotations in 26 minutes.  Rate = 2 rotations / 26 minutes = 1/13 rotations per minute.
* **Ball B:** Completes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. Rate = 5 rotations / 35 minutes = 1/7 rotations per minute.

**2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation times:**

To find when they'll both be at the starting point, we need to find the least common multiple of their rotation periods.  This is because they both need to have completed a whole number of rotations.

* **Ball A's period:** 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation.
* **Ball B's period:** 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 13 * 7 = 91 minutes.

# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)15', 'C)18', 'D)20', 'E)30']","Let H be the set of hardcover books and F be the set of fiction books.
We are given that the total number of books is 45.
The number of hardcover books is |H| = 30.
The number of fiction books is |F| = 20.
We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, which is |H ∩ F|.
By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:
|H ∪ F| = |H| + |F| - |H ∩ F|
Since all books are either hardcover or fiction or both, the total number of books is the union of hardcover and fiction books:
|H ∪ F| ≤ 45
Substituting the given values, we get:
45 ≥ 30 + 20 - |H ∩ F|
45 ≥ 50 - |H ∩ F|
|H ∩ F| ≥ 50 - 45
|H ∩ F| ≥ 5
However, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller of the two sets, which is the number of fiction books (20).  Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

But we also know that |H ∪ F| = 45. So:
45 = 30 + 20 - |H ∩ F|
45 = 50 - |H ∩ F|
|H ∩ F| = 50 - 45 = 5
The maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.  However, if there are only 45 books total and 30 are hardcover, there must be at least 15 books that are not hardcover. Similarly, if there are 20 fiction books, there must be at least 25 non-fiction books.  The overlap cannot be more than the smaller of the two categories (fiction at 20).  However, the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction must be at least 5.  The question asks for the *maximum* number.

Let's consider the case where there are 20 books that are both hardcover and fiction. Then there are 10 hardcover books that are not fiction, and 0 fiction books that are not hardcover. This adds up to 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books.  This is a valid configuration.  Therefore, the maximum number is 20.

# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)30', 'C)45', 'D)60', 'E)75']","Let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday through Saturday.
The number of newspapers bought on Sunday is 2x.
The total cost of newspapers for the week is $210.
The cost of newspapers on Monday through Saturday is $1 * x = x.
The cost of newspapers on Sunday is $4 * 2x = 8x.
The total cost is x + 8x = 9x.
We have the equation: 9x = 210

Since the number of newspapers must be a whole number, there's a mistake in the problem statement or the given options. Let's check the equation again.

The cost of newspapers on Monday through Saturday is $1 * x = x.
The cost of newspapers on Sunday is $4 * 2x = 8x.
The total cost is x + 8x = 9x = $210
x = 210/9 = 70/3 which is not a whole number.  There is an error in the problem statement or answer choices.  The number of newspapers bought on any day must be a whole number.


Let's assume there's a mistake in the problem and try to solve it using the answer choices.

If the number of newspapers bought on Monday is 15, then the number bought Monday-Saturday is 15 * 6 = 90.  Sunday's papers are 180. Total cost = 90(1) + 180(4) = 810. This is too high.

If the number of newspapers bought on Monday is 30, then the number bought Monday-Saturday is 30 * 6 = 180. Sunday's papers are 360. Total cost = 180(1) + 360(4) = 1620. This is also too high.

# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)12', 'C)16', 'D)24', 'E)25']","Let x be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.
The total amount planned to be spent on eatables is Rs. 96.
The original contribution per person would be 96/x.
Four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4.
The new contribution per person is 96/(x - 4).
The new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per person.  So we can set up the equation:

96/(x - 4) = 96/x + 4

Now we solve for x:

96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x² - 16x
0 = 4x² - 16x - 384
0 = x² - 4x - 96

This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it:

(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0

The possible solutions are x = 12 and x = -8. Since the number of friends cannot be negative, x = 12.
Therefore, the original number of friends was 12.
The number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.

# Answer option: ['A)18', 'B)20', 'C)25', 'D)26', 'E)27']","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Convert units:**  The common difference is given in months, but the ages are in years.  To keep things consistent, let's convert everything to months.  The youngest member is 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months old. The common difference is 3 months.

**2. Arithmetic Progression:** The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with the first term (a) = 84 months and common difference (d) = 3 months.  Let 'n' be the number of members in the club.

**3. Sum of an Arithmetic Progression:** The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:  S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]

**4. Set up the equation:** We know the sum of the ages (S) is 250 years * 12 months/year = 3000 months.  Substitute the known values into the formula:

3000 = n/2 * [2(84) + (n-1)3]

**5. Solve for n:**

3000 = n/2 * [168 + 3n - 3]
6000 = n * [165 + 3n]
6000 = 165n + 3n²
3n² + 165n - 6000 = 0
n² + 55n - 2000 = 0

This is a quadratic equation.  You can solve it using the quadratic formula:

n = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

where a = 1, b = 55, and c = -2000.

Solving this gives two solutions for n: n = 25 or n = -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 25.

After 3 men drop out, there are M - 3 men remaining.  The total cost of the gift remains D.

Therefore, each of the remaining M - 3 men will now contribute D/(M - 3) rupees.

The increase in contribution per person is:

D/(M - 3) - D/M

To find how much *more* each person has to contribute, we calculate:

D/(M - 3) - D/M = [DM - D(M - 3)] / [M(M - 3)] = [DM - DM + 3D] / [M(M - 3)] = 3D / [M(M - 3)]

# Answer option: ['A)22', 'B)60', 'C)28', 'D)26', 'E)18']","Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

* Let 'x' be the amount of money Mark has.
* Let 'y' be the amount of money John has.

We can translate Mark's statement into an equation:

x + y/2 = 75  (Equation 1)

We can also translate John's statement into an equation:

y + x/3 = 75  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables.  We can solve for y (John's money). Let's solve Equation 1 for x:

x = 75 - y/2

Now substitute this value of x into Equation 2:

y + (75 - y/2)/3 = 75

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3y + 75 - y/2 = 225

Multiply by 2 to eliminate the remaining fraction:

6y + 150 - y = 450

106,"The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)28', 'C)30', 'D)53', 'E)59']","The number of water lilies doubles every two days.  If it takes 60 days to cover the lake starting with one lily, then the lake is half-covered at 58 days (since doubling takes 2 days).  This means there are 2<sup>29</sup> lilies at the 58th day (since 60/2 = 30 doublings, and 30-1 = 29 doublings to half-coverage).


If we start with 64 lilies (which is 2<sup>6</sup>), it will take fewer days to cover the lake.  We need to find out how many doublings are needed to reach the same number of lilies as in the 58th day of the original scenario.

We need to solve: 64 * 2<sup>x</sup> = 2<sup>29</sup>

This simplifies to: 2<sup>6</sup> * 2<sup>x</sup> = 2<sup>29</sup>
Which means: 2<sup>6+x</sup> = 2<sup>29</sup>

Therefore: 6 + x = 29
Solving for x: x = 23

Since each doubling takes 2 days, it will take 23 doublings * 2 days/doubling = 46 days.


However, there is a more straightforward way to think about this:


If it takes 60 days to cover the lake starting with 1 lily, and the number of lilies doubles every 2 days, then at day 58, the lake is half covered. That means there are 2<sup>29</sup> lilies.

If we start with 64 lilies (2<sup>6</sup>), we need to figure out how many doublings are needed to go from 2<sup>6</sup> to 2<sup>29</sup>.  That's 29 - 6 = 23 doublings.  Since each doubling takes 2 days, it will take 23 * 2 = 46 days.

Let's check if we started with 64 lilies, after 46 days we would have 64 * 2^(46/2) = 64 * 2^23 = 2^6 * 2^23 = 2^29 lilies.  This is the same number as what we would have at day 58 of the initial scenario.  Therefore, it will take 46 days to fully cover the lake.


The closest answer is not present in the options.  There must be a mistake in the question or options. However, based on our calculations the correct answer should be 46 days.

107,"x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
# Answer option: ['A)x2/y2 units', 'B)y3/x2 units', 'C)x3/y2 units', 'D)y2/x2 units', 'E)None of these']","**Explanation:**

The rate of work done by x men working x hours per day is x * x = x² units of work per day.  In x days, they complete x * x² = x³ units of work.

Now, consider y men working y hours per day. Their rate of work is y * y = y² units of work per day.  In y days, they complete y * y² = y³ units of work.

Therefore, the amount of work completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is y³ units.  To express this in terms of x, we need to find the ratio of the work done by y men to the work done by x men.

The ratio is (y³/x³) = (y/x)³.


However, the question asks how much work can be completed, and we don't have a direct relationship between x and y.  We know that x men working x hours a day complete x³ units of work in x days.   y men working y hours a day will complete y³ units of work in y days. There is no way to express this in terms of x²/y², y³/x², x³/y², or y²/x².

# Answer option: ['A)80°', 'B)130°', 'C)140°', 'D)160°', 'E)220°']","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand Arc Bisection:** Point B bisects minor arc AC, meaning it divides the arc into two equal parts.  Since minor arc AC is 160°, each of the arcs AB and BC is 160°/2 = 80°.

**2. Find Arc CD:** We know that the total degrees in a circle is 360°.  The sum of arcs AC and BD is 160° + 150° = 310°.  The remaining portion of the circle, which is arc CD, is 360° - 310° = 50°.

**3. Determine Arc AD:** We have arc AB = 80° and arc BC = 80° and arc CD = 50°. Arc AD is the sum of arcs AB, BC, and CD. Therefore, arc AD = 80° + 80° + 50° = 210°. However, we are asked for the measure of the *minor* arc AD.  Since 210° is greater than 180°, the minor arc AD is the remaining portion of the circle: 360° - 210° = 150°.  There must be an error in the problem statement or the provided answers. Let's re-examine using only the given information.

**Corrected Approach:**

We are given that arc AC = 160° and arc BD = 150°. Point B bisects arc AC, meaning arc AB = arc BC = 80°.

To find arc AD, we consider the arcs AB and BD.  The measure of arc AD is simply the sum of arc AB and arc BD.
arc AD = arc AB + arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°. This is a major arc.  The minor arc AD is 360° - 230° = 130°.

110,"If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
# Answer option: ['A)5%', 'B)15%', 'C)25%', 'D)35%', 'E)45%']","Let W be the percentage of employees who take a winter vacation.
Let S be the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation.
Let B be the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation.
Let N be the percentage of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

We are given:
W = 75%
B = 40%
N = 20%

The total percentage of employees is 100%.  The employees who take at least one vacation (winter or summer or both) is 100% - N = 100% - 20% = 80%.

We can use a Venn diagram to visualize this.  The overlap between W and S is B = 40%.
The portion of W that doesn't overlap with S is W - B = 75% - 40% = 35%.
The total of employees taking a winter vacation is the sum of those who take only a winter vacation and those who take both winter and summer vacations: 35% + 40% = 75% (which matches the given information).

The total percentage of employees taking at least one vacation is 80%, and this is made up of those taking only winter, only summer, and both.  We know the percentage taking both (40%) and those taking only winter (35%).  Therefore:

Only summer vacation + only winter vacation + both winter and summer vacation = 80%
Only summer vacation + 35% + 40% = 80%
Only summer vacation = 80% - 35% - 40% = 5%

Therefore, 5% of employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

111,"The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is?
# Answer option: ['A)26', 'B)28', 'C)21', 'D)80', 'E)23']","The cross-section of the canal is a trapezium.  The area of a trapezium is given by the formula:

Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height

In this case:

* Sum of parallel sides = 10 m + 6 m = 16 m
* Area = 640 square meters
* Height = depth of the canal (let's call it 'h')

We can set up the equation:

640 = (1/2) * 16 * h

Solving for h:

640 = 8h
h = 640 / 8
h = 80 meters

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

112,"During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost?
# Answer option: ['A)70', 'B)30', 'C)3', 'D)7', 'E)5']","Let the total number of matches played be 'x'.
The team won 20 matches, and lost 30% of their matches.  This means they won 70% of their matches (100% - 30% = 70%).

We can set up an equation:

0.70x = 20

Solving for x:

x = 20 / 0.70 = 200/7 ≈ 28.57

Since you can't have a fraction of a match, there's likely a slight error in the problem statement or the provided answer choices.  Let's assume the problem meant to say they won 70% of their matches and lost 30%.  Then:

0.30x = number of lost matches
0.70x = 20

Solving for x using the second equation:

x = 20 / 0.70 ≈ 28.57  Again, this is not a whole number, which is impossible for the number of matches played.

However, if we assume the problem meant the team *lost* 30% of their *won* matches (rather than their total), the answer choices would still not align.

Let's use the only consistent information: They won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. The number of matches lost is 30% of the total number of matches (20 won + lost matches). Let 'y' be the number of lost matches:

20 + y = total matches
y = 0.30 * (20 + y)
y = 6 + 0.3y
0.7y = 6
y = 6/0.7 ≈ 8.57

Again, we have a fraction.  There appears to be an inconsistency in the problem statement or answer choices.  Based on the closest whole number, the number of lost matches would be approximately 9. None of the answer choices match this.  The best we can do is assume it's close to the value of option A.

# Answer option: ['A)750pi', 'B)1500pi', 'C)1875pi', 'D)3000pi', 'E)7500pi']","Here's how to solve the fan blade problem:

**1. Find the angular speed in radians per second:**

* The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute.
* There are 2π radians in one revolution.
* Convert minutes to seconds: 1 minute = 60 seconds.
* Angular speed = (300 revolutions/minute) * (2π radians/revolution) * (1 minute/60 seconds) = 10π radians/second

**2. Calculate the distance traveled:**

* The point is 10 centimeters from the center. This is the radius (r) of the circular path.
* The distance traveled in one rotation (circumference) is 2πr = 2π(10 cm) = 20π cm.
* In 30 seconds, the point travels through an angle of (10π radians/second) * 30 seconds = 300π radians.
* The distance traveled is the arc length, which is given by the formula: arc length = r * θ, where θ is the angle in radians.

# Answer option: ['A)20 < x < 54', 'B)23 < x < 58', 'C)25 < x < 64', 'D)28 < x < 60', 'E)None of these']","Let the expression be
x = (n² + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
We can rewrite the numerator as:
n² + 2√n(n + 4) + 16 = n² + 2n√n + 8√n + 16
We can factor the denominator as a perfect square:
n + 4√n + 4 = (√n + 2)²
Let's try to factor the numerator. Notice that it resembles the expansion of (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b².  Let's see if we can express the numerator in this form.

Let a = n and b = 4. Then (a+b)² = n² + 8n + 16.  This is close but not quite the same as the numerator.

However, let's try a different approach. Let's consider the numerator:
n² + 2√n(n+4) + 16 = n² + 2n√n + 8√n + 16

We can rewrite the numerator as:
n² + 2n√n + 8√n + 16 = n² + 2n√n + 4(2√n) + 16

This doesn't seem to easily factor.  Let's try another method.  Let's simplify the expression:

x = (n² + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
x = (n² + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / ((√n + 2)²)

Since 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, let's test the boundaries:

If n = 36, then √n = 6.
x = (36² + 2(6)(36+4) + 16) / (36 + 4(6) + 4) = (1296 + 480 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4) = 1792 / 64 = 28

If n = 72, then √n ≈ 8.485.
x ≈ (72² + 2(8.485)(72+4) + 16) / (72 + 4(8.485) + 4) ≈ (5184 + 1236.78 + 16) / (72 + 33.94 + 4) ≈ 6436.78 / 109.94 ≈ 58.54

Therefore, 28 ≤ x ≤ 58.54. The closest option is B.

# Answer option: ['A)2 months', 'B)4 months', 'C)23 months', 'D)24 months', 'E)84 months']","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine the investment period for A and B:**

* A invested for the entire year (12 months).
* B invested for 10 months (12 months - 2 months).

**2. Determine C's share of the profit:**

* C's share of the profit is Rs. 150,000 out of a total profit of Rs. 375,000.  This represents a 150,000/375,000 = 40% share of the profit.

**3. Calculate the profit ratio based on investment and time:**

The profit is shared proportionally to the investment and the time the money is invested.  Let's represent the number of months C invested as 'x'.

* A's investment = 40,000 * 12 = 480,000
* B's investment = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000
* C's investment = 120,000 * x

The ratio of their profit shares should reflect the ratio of their investment * time:

480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000x  =  150,000 : 150,000 : 150,000*2

**4. Solve for x:**

We know that C has a 40% share of the profits, which is equivalent to a profit share ratio of 2:2:1.  Therefore, we can use the proportion to find x.

The easiest approach is to look at the ratio of C's profit share to A's profit share:

(120,000 * x) / (40,000 * 12) = 1/2

Solving for x:

120,000x = 480,000/2
120,000x = 240,000
x = 2

C joined 2 months after B.

# Answer option: ['A)8.75', 'B)8.79', 'C)8.75', 'D)8.71', 'E)8.72']","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Area of the square:**

* The side of the square is 20 cm.
* Area of the square = side * side = 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 sq cm

**2. Area of the two semicircles:**

* The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm.
* Radius of each semicircle = diameter / 2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm
* Area of one semicircle = (1/2) * π * radius² = (1/2) * π * (10 cm)² = 50π sq cm
* Since there are two semicircles, their total area = 2 * 50π sq cm = 100π sq cm

**3. Area of the remaining paper:**

* Area of the remaining paper = Area of the square - Area of the two semicircles
* Area of the remaining paper = 400 sq cm - 100π sq cm 
* Using π ≈ 3.14159, the area is approximately 400 - 314.159 = 85.841 sq cm

**4.  Discrepancy:**

There's a significant difference between the calculated area (approximately 85.841 sq cm) and the answer choices provided. The answer choices suggest a much smaller remaining area, on the order of 8.75 sq cm.  This strongly implies there's a misinterpretation of the problem statement.  The phrasing ""drawn on its opposites as diameters"" is unclear.  It's possible the semicircles are intended to be drawn on opposite *sides* of the square, not opposite *corners*. If that's the case, there would be one semicircle on each of two opposite sides and those semicircles would not overlap. 


**Assuming the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides:**

If the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides, each with a diameter of 20 cm, then the area of one semicircle would be 50π sq cm. The combined area of both semicircles would be 100π sq cm, as calculated above. The area of the remaining paper would still be 400 - 100π sq cm, or approximately 85.84 sq cm, which differs from the given options.

**Conclusion:**

There's a significant error either in the question's wording or the provided answer choices.  The calculations above are correct based on a reasonable interpretation of the problem.  Without a clarification of the problem statement, a precise answer from the given options is impossible.

8 men work for 6 days to complete the work W.
The total work done is the product of the number of men, the number of days, and the rate of work per man per day.  Let's assume the rate of work per man per day is R.  Then:

W = 8 men * 6 days * R = 48R

Now, we want to find the number of men needed to complete the same work W in 1/2 day. Let's call this number of men 'x'.  The equation becomes:

W = x men * (1/2) day * R

Since W is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions for W:

48R = x * (1/2) * R

We can divide both sides by R (assuming R is not zero):

Kevin's speed from A to B is 70 mph.
Kevin's speed from B to A is 90 mph.

3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from B while approaching B.  This means he had 70 miles left to travel to reach B. The time it takes him to cover this 70 miles at 70 mph is 1 hour (70 miles / 70 mph = 1 hour).

Therefore, the total remaining time of his trip is 1 hour (to reach B) + x hours (to return to A).  Since the total remaining time is 3 hours, x = 2 hours.

(3c - 10)(c - 3) = 0
This gives two possible solutions for c: c = 10/3 (not an integer) or c = 3.
Since c must be an integer, we have c = 3.

Now we find a and b:
a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8
b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 2(3) = 6

Therefore, the three-digit number is 863.
Let's check if this satisfies all conditions:
1. 8 + 6 + 3 = 17 (True)
2. 8² + 6² + 3² = 64 + 36 + 9 = 109 (True)
3. 863 - 495 = 368 (Reverse of 863 is 368 which is not true, there must be a mistake)

Let's re-examine the equations.  There was an error in solving the quadratic equation.  The factoring should be:
(3c - 10)(c - 3) = 0
c = 3 or c = 10/3. Since c must be an integer, c = 3.

If c = 3, then a = 8 and b = 6.  The number is 863. 863 - 495 = 368 (This is the reverse of digits)

126,"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
# Answer option: ['A)69:91', 'B)59:91', 'C)59:90', 'D)59:91', 'E)69:101']","**1. Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X:**

* Alloy X has a ratio of zinc to copper of 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.
* This means that in every 5 parts of alloy X, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper.
* In 40 grams of alloy X:
    * Zinc = (2/5) * 40g = 16g
    * Copper = (3/5) * 40g = 24g

**2. Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y:**

* Alloy Y has a ratio of zinc to copper of 7:11.
* In every 18 parts of alloy Y, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.
* In 60 grams of alloy Y:
    * Zinc = (7/18) * 60g = 70/3 g ≈ 23.33g
    * Copper = (11/18) * 60g = 110/3 g ≈ 36.67g

**3. Find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:**

* Total zinc in alloy Z = 16g + 23.33g ≈ 39.33g
* Total copper in alloy Z = 24g + 36.67g ≈ 60.67g

**4. Find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:**

* Ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z ≈ 39.33 : 60.67
* To simplify, we can approximate the ratio to the nearest whole number:  39:61.  This isn't directly in the options. Let's go back and use fractions instead of rounding.

**5. Using fractions for more accuracy:**

* Total zinc = 16 + 70/3 = (48 + 70)/3 = 118/3 g
* Total copper = 24 + 110/3 = (72 + 110)/3 = 182/3 g
* Ratio of zinc to copper = (118/3) : (182/3) = 118 : 182
* Simplify by dividing by 2: 59 : 91

# Answer option: ['A)600, 400', 'B)628, 372', 'C)640, 360', 'D)None of these', 'E)Cannot be determined']","Let the two numbers be x and y.
We are given that the difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000, so we can write this as:
x² - y² = 256000

We are also given that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so:
x + y = 1000

We can factor the difference of squares:
(x + y)(x - y) = 256000

Substitute the value of x + y from the second equation into the factored equation:
(1000)(x - y) = 256000

Now, solve for (x - y):
x - y = 256000 / 1000
x - y = 256

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
x + y = 1000
x - y = 256

Add the two equations together to eliminate y:
2x = 1256
x = 628

Now substitute the value of x back into either equation to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:
628 + y = 1000
y = 1000 - 628
y = 372

So the two numbers are 628 and 372.

# Answer option: ['A)3267', 'B)2678', 'C)2797', 'D)2300', 'E)2781']","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Eligible voters:** 20% of 5000 voters are ineligible, so 80% are eligible.  80% of 5000 = 0.80 * 5000 = 4000 eligible voters.

2. **Winning margin:** The winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes.  This means the difference between the votes of the winning and losing candidate was 15% of 4000. 15% of 4000 = 0.15 * 4000 = 600 votes.

3. **Total votes:** Let's say 'x' is the number of votes the losing candidate got. The winning candidate got x + 600 votes.  Together, they received all the eligible votes: x + (x + 600) = 4000.

4. **Solving for x:**  2x + 600 = 4000 => 2x = 3400 => x = 1700 votes (losing candidate)

136,"For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']","Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
The diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.  The total amount earned is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.

We can set up two equations:

* **Equation 1 (value):** 20c + 25b = 340
* **Equation 2 (integer constraint):** c and b must be non-negative integers.

We need to find the minimum value of 'c' that satisfies these equations. Let's solve for 'b' in terms of 'c' from Equation 1:

25b = 340 - 20c
b = (340 - 20c) / 25

Since 'b' must be a non-negative integer, (340 - 20c) must be divisible by 25.  Let's test values of 'c':

* **If c = 0:** b = 340/25 = 13.6 (not an integer)
* **If c = 1:** b = (340 - 20)/25 = 320/25 = 12.8 (not an integer)
* **If c = 2:** b = (340 - 40)/25 = 300/25 = 12 (integer!)
* **If c = 3:** b = (340 - 60)/25 = 280/25 = 11.2 (not an integer)
* **If c = 4:** b = (340 - 80)/25 = 260/25 = 10.4 (not an integer)
* **If c = 5:** b = (340 - 100)/25 = 240/25 = 9.6 (not an integer)
* and so on...

The first integer solution we find is when c = 2 and b = 12.  Any higher value of 'c' will also be a solution, but we are looking for the *minimum* number of copper coins.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins is 2.

The time it takes him to run to school is t1 = d/10 hours.
The time it takes him to walk home is t2 = d/5 hours.
The total time is t1 + t2 = 1 hour.
So, d/10 + d/5 = 1
Multiplying both sides by 10, we get:
d + 2d = 10
3d = 10
d = 10/3 miles

Let's convert this to a mixed number:
10/3 = 3 and 1/3 miles

This answer is not among the choices provided. Let's check the calculation again.

The time taken to run to school is d/10 hours.
The time taken to walk back home is d/5 hours.
Total time = d/10 + d/5 = 1 hour
Multiplying by 10 to eliminate fractions:
d + 2d = 10
3d = 10
d = 10/3 hours.  This is the time, not the distance.

Let's use the formula: distance = speed × time.
Let the distance be x miles.
Time taken to run to school = x/10 hours
Time taken to walk back home = x/5 hours
Total time = x/10 + x/5 = 1 hour
Multiplying by 10:
x + 2x = 10

x = 10/3 miles

The question asks for the distance, not the time.  10/3 miles is approximately 3.33 miles.  None of the options match this exactly.  There might be an error in the question or the answer choices.  Let's re-examine the problem to find the flaw.

# Answer option: ['A)0.5', 'B)0.6', 'C)0.7', 'D)0.8', 'E)0.9']","Here's how to solve this probability problem:

**1. Understand Independent Events:**

Since A and B are independent events, the probability of both A and B occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

**2. Probability of at least one event:**

The probability that at least one of A or B occurs is given as 0.96.  This can be expressed as:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

**3. Substitute and Solve:**

We know P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.  Substitute these values, along with the formula for independent events, into the equation:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Now, solve for P(B):

0.96 - 0.6 = P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)
0.36 = P(B) * (1 - 0.6)
0.36 = P(B) * 0.4

Relative speed = (D/4) + (D/3.5) = D(1/4 + 1/3.5) = D(0.25 + 0.2857) ≈ D(0.5357)

**4.  Calculate the time to meet:**

Train M starts 2 hours before Train N.  Let's calculate how long it takes from when Train N leaves (7 am) until they meet. Let's call this time 't'.

In time 't', Train M covers (D/4) * (t + 2)  (since it has a 2-hour head start). In the same time, Train N covers (D/3.5) * t.

The sum of these distances equals the total distance D:
(D/4)(t + 2) + (D/3.5)t = D

Divide by D to simplify:
(t + 2)/4 + t/3.5 = 1
 

**5. Solve for t:**

Solve the equation for 't':

(t + 2)/4 + t/3.5 = 1
3.5(t+2) + 4t = 14
3.5t + 7 + 4t = 14
7.5t = 7
t = 7/7.5 = 14/15 hours

**6. Convert to minutes:**

14/15 hours * 60 minutes/hour ≈ 56 minutes

**7. Find the meeting time:**

Train N leaves at 7:00 am. They meet after 56 minutes.  Therefore, they meet at approximately 7:56 am.


Answer: {D) 56 min}

# Answer option: ['A)1 minute', 'B)2 minutes', 'C)3 minutes', 'D)4 minutes', 'E)5 minutes']","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find their combined speed:**

* Janice's speed: 10 miles per hour
* Jennie's speed: 20 miles per hour
* Combined speed: 10 mph + 20 mph = 30 mph

**2. Convert the combined speed to miles per minute:**

* There are 60 minutes in an hour, so their combined speed is 30 miles / 60 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute.

**3. Calculate the time to bike 1 mile:**

* They bike at a combined speed of 0.5 miles per minute.
* To bike 1 mile, it will take 1 mile / 0.5 miles per minute = 2 minutes.

151,"In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M?
# Answer option: ['A)278', 'B)2890', 'C)270', 'D)2702', 'E)960']","Let the maximum mark be M.
The candidate secured 504 marks out of M.  This can be expressed as a fraction: 504/M.

If the maximum mark is converted to 800, the candidate would have secured 420 marks.  This gives us another fraction: 420/800.

Since these fractions represent the same proportion of marks, we can set them equal to each other:

504/M = 420/800

Now we can solve for M by cross-multiplying:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403200 = 420M

M = 403200 / 420

M = 960

Therefore, the value of M is 960.

# Answer option: ['A)6', 'B)8', 'C)10', 'D)12', 'E)14']","The ratio of people to soda bottles is 8 people / 10 bottles = 0.8 people per bottle.

To find out how many bottles are needed for 12 people, we divide the number of people by the people-per-bottle ratio:

12 people / 0.8 people/bottle = 15 bottles

However, since you can't buy parts of bottles, Jill will need to buy 15 bottles.  This isn't among the options. Let's re-examine the problem.  It seems to assume a simple proportional relationship.


If 8 people need 10 bottles, then the ratio is 10/8 = 1.25 bottles per person.

For 12 people, she would need 12 people * 1.25 bottles/person = 15 bottles.  Again, this is not in the options.


Let's assume there's a mistake in the question and that it intends a simpler, directly proportional relationship where the number of bottles increases linearly with the number of people. We can set up a proportion:

8 people / 10 bottles = 12 people / x bottles

Cross-multiplying:

8x = 120

x = 15

Since 15 is not an option, there must be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices.  The closest option is 12, but it is not the correct answer according to a simple linear relationship.  We could interpret the 10 bottles for 8 as a slight overestimate, but this is a speculation.

We have h1 = 4 inches, s1 = 10 inches, and h2 = 6 inches.

We can set up a proportion:

h1 / s1 = h2 / s2

4 / 10 = 6 / s2

# Answer option: ['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']","Let h be the height of the room and P be the semi-perimeter of the room.
We are given that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5.  Therefore, h/P = 2/5, which means 5h = 2P.

The area of the walls is given by 2hP (since the area of the walls is the perimeter multiplied by the height).
The area of the walls, excluding doors and windows, is 2hP - 15 sq.m.

The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260. The cost of paper is Rs. 2 per meter, and the width of the paper is 50 cm (0.5 m).
The total area of paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 sq.m.

Therefore, the area of the walls excluding doors and windows is 130 sq.m.
So, 2hP - 15 = 130
2hP = 145

We have two equations:
1) 5h = 2P
2) 2hP = 145

From equation (1), P = (5h)/2.  Substitute this into equation (2):
2h * ((5h)/2) = 145
5h² = 145
h² = 29
h = √29 ≈ 5.385 m

However, this doesn't match any of the answer choices. Let's re-examine the area calculation.  The area of paper used is 130 sq m.  The width of the paper is 0.5 m. So the length of the paper used is 130 sq m / 0.5 m = 260 m.  The total cost is 260 m * 2 Rs/m = 520 Rs.  There's a discrepancy here.  The problem states the cost is 260 Rs.

Let's use the correct cost of Rs. 260.  The area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is 260/2 = 130 sq m.
So 2hP - 15 = 130
2hP = 145
Since 5h = 2P, then P = 5h/2. Substituting this into 2hP = 145:
2h(5h/2) = 145
5h² = 145
h² = 29
h = √29 ≈ 5.385 m

This still doesn't match the answer choices. There must be an error in the problem statement or answer choices.  Let's assume there was an error in the cost calculation and the actual area of the walls excluding doors and windows is 130 sq m.

Let's check the answer choices:
If h = 3.9 m, then  P = 5(3.9)/2 = 9.75 m
Area = 2 * 3.9 * 9.75 = 76.05 sq m. This is not equal to 130 sq m.
If h= 4m, P=10, Area = 2*4*10=80.
None of the choices produce the required area.  There's a significant problem with the question's wording or data.

However, there's a constraint: the PM must speak before the MP, and the MP must speak before the MLA.  This means that for every arrangement of the three, there are 2 other equivalent arrangements that violate the constraint.  For example, if the order is PM, MP, MLA, then the other arrangements PM, MLA, MP and MP, PM, MLA are not allowed. Thus only one out of 3! = 6 possible arrangements of the PM, MP, and MLA is allowed.  

To account for this constraint, we divide the total number of arrangements (10!) by the number of ways the PM, MP, and MLA can be arranged (3!), which is 6.

# Answer option: ['A)$8', 'B)$10', 'C)$13.6', 'D)$22.9', 'E)$40']","Let the original price of each article be P dollars.
Anna could originally buy N articles for $300, so N * P = 300.

After the price decreased by 15%, the new price is 0.85P.
Now Anna can buy N + 5 articles for $300, so (N + 5) * 0.85P = 300.

We have two equations:
1) NP = 300
2) (N + 5) * 0.85P = 300

From equation (1), N = 300/P.  Substitute this into equation (2):
(300/P + 5) * 0.85P = 300
300 * 0.85 + 5 * 0.85P = 300
255 + 4.25P = 300
4.25P = 300 - 255
4.25P = 45
P = 45 / 4.25 
P ≈ 10.588

The original price is approximately $10.59.
The new price is 0.85 * P = 0.85 * 10.588 ≈ $9

Let's check:
If the new price is $10, then Anna can buy 30 articles.  Originally she could buy 30 articles for $300, implying original price of $10.  This doesn't fit the problem statement.

Let's use the equations again:
NP = 300
(N+5)(0.85P) = 300
0.85NP + 4.25P = 300
0.85(300) + 4.25P = 300
255 + 4.25P = 300
4.25P = 45
P = 45/4.25 = 10.588...
New price = 0.85P = 0.85 * 10.588... ≈ 9

If the new price is $10, then she buys 30 articles.  This doesn't work because she buys 5 more articles.

Let's try the answer choices:
If the new price is $10, then she can buy 30 articles, which is 5 more than she could before.  The original price would have been $10 * (30/25) = $12, a 20% decrease.  This is incorrect.

Let's work backwards from the choices. If the new price is $10, then she buys 30 articles. Therefore, originally she bought 25 articles, at a price of $12 each.  This corresponds to a 16.67% reduction, not 15%.  The closest answer is $10.

**2. The gap between them:**

There are 6 children between Radha and Neha.  This means there are 6 + 1 + 1 = 8 children  between Radha and Neha (adding one for Radha and one for Neha).

**3. Total children:**

* Children to the left of Neha: 13 (14 -1)
* Children between Neha and Radha: 8

The amount of sand in the mixture is 30% of 10 kg = 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg
The amount of clay in the mixture is 70% of 10 kg = 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg

Let x kg of the mixture be removed and replaced with pure sand.
The amount of sand removed is 0.3x kg
The amount of clay removed is 0.7x kg

After removing x kg of the mixture, the remaining amount of sand is 3 - 0.3x kg
The remaining amount of clay is 7 - 0.7x kg

After adding x kg of pure sand, the new amount of sand is (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg
The amount of clay remains the same: 7 - 0.7x kg

We want the amounts of sand and clay to be equal, so we set up the equation:
3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x

# Answer option: ['A)58.3%', 'B)62.5%', 'C)63.5%', 'D)64.5%', 'E)65.5%']","Let the man's income be I.
He spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is 0.7I.
His income increases by 20%, so his new income is I + 0.2I = 1.2I.
If he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure will be 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I.
To find the percentage of his new income that he spends, we divide his new expenditure by his new income and multiply by 100:
(0.84I / 1.2I) * 100 = 0.7 * 100 = 70%
However, this is incorrect because the question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of his *new* income.  Let's calculate it correctly:

New expenditure = 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I
New income = 1.2I
Percentage of new income spent = (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 0.7 * 100% = 70%

This is incorrect. The problem is interpreting the question.  The question is a little ambiguous. If it means the man maintains the *same* spending habit (70%), then the new expenditure is still 70%. If it means that expenditure also increases by 20%, then we would calculate: 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I, meaning that he spends 84% of his original income, but that is not in percentage of the new income. To calculate the percentage of the *new* income spent:

Original expenditure: 0.7I
Income increase: 20%  => New income = 1.2I
New expenditure (assuming same spending habit): 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I
Percentage of new income spent: (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 70%

Let's re-examine the question.  The question seems to imply that the *proportion* of income spent remains constant at 70%, even after his income increases.  Therefore the new expenditure is 70% of his new income.

New expenditure = 0.7 * (1.2I) = 0.84I
New expenditure as a percentage of new income = (0.84I / 1.2I) * 100% = 70%

There must be a misunderstanding in the question or the answer choices.  The answer choices are incorrect given the interpretation that he keeps the same spending habit.  If he increases his expenditure by 20%, the new expenditure is 0.84I. This is 70% of the new income.  Therefore none of the answers are correct.

Sharon earns x in 5 hours, so her earning rate is x/5 per hour.
Karen earns x in 4 hours, so her earning rate is x/4 per hour.

When they work together, their combined earning rate is (x/5) + (x/4) per hour.  To find the combined rate, we need a common denominator:

Therefore, the inequality becomes -x³ > y².

Let's analyze the answer choices:

A) x > y:  This is not necessarily true.  For example, x = -2 and y = 1 satisfies the given conditions, but x is not greater than y.

B) y² > x²: This is not necessarily true. Since x is negative and y is positive, x² will always be positive.  However,  -x³ > y² implies that |x³| > y², which doesn't guarantee y² > x². For example, if x = -2 and y = 1, then y² = 1 and x² = 4.

C) -x³ < y²: This is false. We are given that -x³ > y².

D) –x < y: Since x < 0, -x > 0.  Since y > 0, this inequality could be true, but it's not guaranteed. For example, if x = -2 and y = 1, then -x = 2, which is greater than y.  If x = -1 and y = 2, then -x = 1 which is less than y.

E) x < -y: Since x < 0 and y > 0, x is always less than -y. This is always true.  For example, if x = -2 and y = 1, then x = -2 < -1 = -y.

# Answer option: ['A)45', 'B)48', 'C)51', 'D)54', 'E)57']","Let's say the distance ant A travels is 'x' cm.  Since the ants are moving towards each other, the distance ant B travels will be (75 - x) cm.

We know the time taken for them to meet will be the same for both ants.  Time = Distance / Speed.

Therefore:

x / 9 = (75 - x) / 6

Cross-multiply:

6x = 9(75 - x)
6x = 675 - 9x
15x = 675
x = 45

Ant A travels 45 cm before meeting ant B.

169,"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?
# Answer option: ['A)9 Trousers', 'B)8 Trousers', 'C)10 Trousers', 'D)7 Trousers', 'E)11 Trousers']","Let's denote the number of trousers as 't' and the number of shirts as 's'.
The cost of trousers is 70t and the cost of shirts is 30s.
The total spending is 810, so we have the equation: 70t + 30s = 810.
We want to maximize the number of trousers purchased.  To do this, we need to minimize the number of shirts.

Let's try different values of 't' and see if we can find a solution that works:

* If t = 9: 70(9) + 30s = 810  =>  630 + 30s = 810  =>  30s = 180  => s = 6. This works!

* If t = 10: 70(10) + 30s = 810 => 700 + 30s = 810 => 30s = 110 => s = 11/3 (not a whole number)

* If t = 8: 70(8) +30s = 810 => 560 + 30s = 810 => 30s = 250 => s = 25/3 (not a whole number)


Since we need whole numbers for the number of trousers and shirts, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9.

170,"If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue?
# Answer option: ['A)$7.73', 'B)$6.73', 'C)$5.73', 'D)$4.73', 'E)$3.73']","Here's how to solve the magazine subscription problem:

**1. Find the total cover price without the discount:**

* The subscription price represents 75% (100% - 25%) of the total cover price.
* Let 'x' be the total cover price.  Then 0.75x = $42.00
* Solving for x: x = $42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00

**2. Find the cover price per issue:**

* There are 15 issues.
* Cover price per issue = Total cover price / Number of issues = $56.00 / 15 = $3.73

Therefore, the cover price per issue is $3.73.

They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)23', 'C)16', 'D)18', 'E)12']","Let H be the number of times the coin landed on heads, and T be the number of times the coin landed on tails.
We are given that the total number of coin flips is 20, so H + T = 20.
When the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, and when it lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher.
After 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money. This means that the total amount Christopher gave to Jonathan is equal to the total amount Jonathan gave to Christopher.
The total amount Christopher gave to Jonathan is 2H.
The total amount Jonathan gave to Christopher is 3T.
Since they neither won nor lost any money, we have the equation:
2H = 3T
We also have H + T = 20.  We can solve this system of equations.
From H + T = 20, we can express T as T = 20 - H.
Substitute this into the equation 2H = 3T:
2H = 3(20 - H)
2H = 60 - 3H
5H = 60
H = 12
Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

172,"Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
# Answer option: ['A)144km', 'B)72 km', 'C)126km', 'D)84 km', 'E)48km']","Let the distance between X and Y be D km.
Allen's speed = 54 kmph
Bob's speed = 78 kmph

When they first meet, let the distance covered by Allen be d1 and the distance covered by Bob be d2.  Then d1 + d2 = D.
The time taken for them to meet is t1 = d1/54 = d2/78.  This gives d1 = (54/78)d2 = (9/13)d2.
Substituting into d1 + d2 = D, we get (9/13)d2 + d2 = D, which simplifies to (22/13)d2 = D.

Allen continues to X and Bob continues to Y.  Then Allen travels back to Y and Bob travels back to X.  They meet for the second time.

Let the total distance covered by Allen be A and the total distance covered by Bob be B.
We are given that B = A + 48.

When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both is 3D.
Time taken = A/54 = B/78
78A = 54B
78A = 54(A+48)
78A = 54A + 2592
24A = 2592
A = 108 km

The total distance covered by Allen is 2D (to Y and back to X).  So 2D = 108, which means D = 54 km.

Let's check the distances:
Allen's distance = 108 km
Bob's distance = 156 km (108 + 48)
Time taken by Allen = 108/54 = 2 hours
Time taken by Bob = 156/78 = 2 hours
This is consistent.

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 54 km. However, this is not among the options. Let's re-examine the problem.


Let's use relative speed.  The relative speed when they are traveling towards each other is 54 + 78 = 132 kmph.  The relative speed when they are traveling away from each other is 78 - 54 = 24 kmph.

Let t be the time they travel until the second meeting.
Distance covered by Allen = 54t
Distance covered by Bob = 78t
78t = 54t + 48
24t = 48
t = 2 hours

Total distance covered by Allen in the first leg = 54(2) =108 km.
Total distance covered by Allen in the whole trip = 2D.  So 2D = 108, D = 54.

Total distance covered by Bob is 156 km.  The difference is 48km which is consistent with the given information.


The distance between X and Y is 54 km.  This is not one of the options. There might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.

173,"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
# Answer option: ['A)8%', 'B)10%', 'C)12.5%', 'D)16.7%', 'E)25%']","Here's how to solve the tire cost problem:

**1. Cost per year for new tires:**

* New tires cost $180 and last 4 years.
* Cost per year = $180 / 4 years = $45/year

**2. Cost per year for repaired tires:**

* Repair cost is $40 per tire and adds 1 year of life.
* Cost per year = $40/year

**3. Percentage difference:**

* Difference in cost per year = $45 - $40 = $5
* Percentage difference = ($5 / $40) * 100% = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

175,"Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
# Answer option: ['A)$5102', 'B)$618', 'C)$216', 'D)$202', 'E)$200']","The bond pays 12% annual interest, compounded semi-annually.  This means the interest rate per compounding period is 12%/2 = 6% or 0.06.

Over one year, there are two compounding periods.  We can calculate the accrued interest using the compound interest formula:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount) = $5000
* r = the annual interest rate (decimal) = 0.12
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year = 2
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for = 1

A = 5000 (1 + 0.06)^(2*1) 
A = 5000 (1.06)^2
A = 5000 * 1.1236
A = $5618

The interest accrued is the difference between the final value and the principal:

Interest = A - P = $5618 - $5000 = $618

# Answer option: ['A)9 2 0 0', 'B)9 2 0 9', 'C)9 2 0 1', 'D)9 2 0 7', 'E)9 2 2 2']","Here's how to solve the multiplication table puzzle:

**1. Analyze the Structure:**

The multiplication involves a three-digit number (MAD) multiplied by a two-digit number (BE) to produce a four-digit number (AMID).  Notice the pattern of how the digits align in the multiplication.

**2. Deduce from the Rightmost Column:**

The rightmost column of the multiplication shows:  D * E = D.  This implies E must be 1 (because any other digit multiplied by E would result in a different last digit).

**3. Deduce from the Second Column:**

The second column (from the right) shows: A * E + D * B = A. Since E=1, this simplifies to: A + D * B = A. This can only be true if D*B = 0. Since neither D nor B can be 0 (they are digits in a number), one of them must be 10 and the other zero but this is impossible. Thus, D must be 0.

**4. Solve for A and B:**

Now we know D = 0 and E = 1.  The multiplication becomes:

   M A 0
x   B 1
--------
   M A 0
M A 0 B
-------
A M I 0

Looking at the second row of partial product, we know  M*1=M and M*B +A*1 = I

The number MAD must be between 100 and 999, and the result must be a four-digit number. Let us try M=9. Then M*B + A= I.  We must choose a value for B such that MA0 x B1 = A MI 0, so try B=2.  Let's plug into the multiplication:

   9 A 0
x   2 1
--------
   9 A 0
18 A 0
-------
A 9 I 0

Given this, we must have A=9. The resulting multiplication is then:

   9 9 0
x   2 1
--------
   9 9 0
19 8 0
-------
2 9 7 0

Now I can see that the value of I is 7.

**5. Final Answer:**

The digits are: M=9, A=9, D=0, B=2, E=1, I=7

# Answer option: ['A)3400', 'B)1700', 'C)3440', 'D)Cannot be determined', 'E)None of these']","Let the length and breadth of the rectangular plot be l and b meters respectively.
The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 2(l + b) = 340 meters.
Therefore, l + b = 170 meters.

A 1-meter-broad boundary is to be made around the plot.  This means the new dimensions of the plot including the boundary will be (l + 2) meters and (b + 2) meters.

The area of the boundary will be the difference between the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) and the area of the smaller rectangle (the plot itself).

Area of larger rectangle = (l + 2)(b + 2) = lb + 2l + 2b + 4
Area of smaller rectangle = lb

Area of the boundary = (lb + 2l + 2b + 4) - lb = 2l + 2b + 4 = 2(l + b) + 4

Since l + b = 170, the area of the boundary is 2(170) + 4 = 344 square meters.

The cost of gardening is 10 per square meter.
Therefore, the total cost = 344 * 10 = 3440

# Answer option: ['A)20 min', 'B)22 min', 'C)23 min', 'D)21 min', 'E)20 min']","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the individual rates:**

* A's rate: 1 wall / 40 minutes
* B's rate: 1 wall / 45 minutes

**2. Find the combined rate:**

To find their combined rate, add their individual rates:

(1/40) + (1/45) = (9/360) + (8/360) = 17/360 walls per minute

**3. Find the time to complete the wall together:**

To find the time it takes them to build one wall together, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:

**1. Find the train's length:**

* The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel completely.  This means the train travels its own length in 3 seconds.
* The train's speed is 120 miles per hour.  Let's convert this to miles per second:
   120 miles/hour * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 1/30 miles/second

* In 3 seconds, the train travels (1/30 miles/second) * 3 seconds = 1/10 miles.  Therefore, the train's length is 1/10 of a mile.

**2. Calculate the total distance the train needs to travel:**

* The train needs to travel its own length *plus* the length of the tunnel to pass completely through.
* Total distance = train length + tunnel length = (1/10 mile) + 1 mile = 1.1 miles

**3. Calculate the time to pass completely through the tunnel:**

# Answer option: ['A)247.67', 'B)237.67', 'C)227.67', 'D)215.67', 'E)None of these']","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the terms:**

* **4/30, n/100:** This means the merchant gets a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

**2. Calculate the discount:**

* Discount = 4% of $20,000 = 0.04 * $20,000 = $800

**3. Calculate the amount payable with the discount:**

* Amount payable = $20,000 - $800 = $19,200

**4. Determine the interest saved:**

* Interest saved = $20,000 - $19,200 = $800

**5. Calculate the number of days the merchant saves interest:**

* Days saved = 100 days - 30 days = 70 days

**6. Calculate the simple interest rate:**

We need to find the interest rate that would make borrowing the $19,200 for 70 days equal to the $800 interest saved.  The simple interest formula is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Where:

* Interest = $800
* Principal = $19,200
* Time = 70/365 years (since we need to convert days into years)

Solving for the rate (R):

$800 = $19,200 * R * (70/365)

R = ($800 * 365) / ($19,200 * 70) 
R ≈ 0.21567

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

R ≈ 21.567%

Let the amount of rice be 2x, wheat be 3x, and corn be 5x.
We are given that the amount of rice is 3 pounds, so 2x = 3.

# Answer option: ['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']","Let's use variables to represent the costs:

* Let 's' be the cost of one soda in cents.
* Let 'e' be the cost of one energy bar in cents.

We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

* Equation 1: s + 2e = 150
* Equation 2: 2s + 3e = 300

We can solve this system of equations.  Let's use the substitution method.  Solve Equation 1 for 's':

s = 150 - 2e

Now substitute this value of 's' into Equation 2:

2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300
300 - 4e + 3e = 300
-e = 0
e = 0

This means the cost of an energy bar is 0 cents.  Substitute e=0 back into either equation (let's use Equation 1):

s + 2(0) = 150
s = 150

So, one soda costs 150 cents.

Now we can find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:

Cost = 6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 cents

191,"A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?
# Answer option: ['A)Rs. 6', 'B)Rs. 7.2', 'C)Rs. 5.6', 'D)Rs. 8', 'E)None of these']","Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Selling Price and Revenue:** The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, generating a total revenue of 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72000.

2. **Profit:** The company aims for a 25% profit on the *total cost of manufacturing all pens*.  Let's denote the total manufacturing cost as 'C'. The profit is then 0.25C.

3. **Total Revenue = Total Cost + Profit:**  The total revenue is equal to the total manufacturing cost plus the profit: 72000 = C + 0.25C

4. **Solving for Total Cost:** This simplifies to 72000 = 1.25C.  Dividing both sides by 1.25, we get C = 72000 / 1.25 = Rs. 57600.

5. **Number of Pens Manufactured:**  Since 10% of the pens are defective, the 7200 delivered pens represent 90% of the total manufactured pens. Let 'x' be the total number of pens manufactured. Then 0.9x = 7200. Solving for x, we get x = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens.

6. **Manufacturing Cost per Pen:** The total manufacturing cost is Rs. 57600 for 8000 pens. Therefore, the manufacturing cost per pen is 57600 / 8000 = Rs. 7.2

10a + b = a + b + 18

Simplifying this equation, we get:
9a = 18
a = 2

We are also given that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place.  This can be written as:

193,"Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which
# Answer option: ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']","Let's analyze the functions L(x, y) and R(x, y).

L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y]

Let's consider some examples:

* **Case 1: x = 1.5, y = 1.5**
   L(1.5, 1.5) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
   R(1.5, 1.5) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
   In this case, L(x, y) < R(x, y)

* **Case 2: x = 1, y = 1**
   L(1, 1) = [1] + [1] + [2] = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   R(1, 1) = [2] + [2] = 2 + 2 = 4
   In this case, L(x, y) = R(x, y)

* **Case 3: x = 1.2, y = 0.8**
   L(1.2, 0.8) = [1.2] + [0.8] + [2] = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3
   R(1.2, 0.8) = [2.4] + [1.6] = 2 + 1 = 3
   In this case, L(x, y) = R(x, y)

* **Case 4: x = 0.5, y = 0.5**
   L(0.5, 0.5) = [0.5] + [0.5] + [1] = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
   R(0.5, 0.5) = [1] + [1] = 1 + 1 = 2
   In this case, L(x, y) < R(x, y)

We can see that it's possible for L(x, y) to equal R(x, y) and for L(x, y) to be less than R(x, y).  It's not always the case that L(x, y) < R(x, y).  The inequality depends on the fractional parts of x and y.

The question asks for when it is *impossible* to find x and y such that a certain condition holds.  Since we've found examples where L(x, y) = R(x, y) and L(x, y) < R(x, y), the only option remaining is that it's impossible to find x and y where L(x, y) > R(x, y). However, there is no strong mathematical basis to assert this definitively without a proof.  The provided options are not well-defined.

194,"Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again?
# Answer option: ['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']","To find when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48 seconds.

First, find the prime factorization of each number:
* 36 = 2² × 3²
* 40 = 2³ × 5
* 48 = 2⁴ × 3

To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations:
* Highest power of 2: 2⁴ = 16
* Highest power of 3: 3² = 9
* Highest power of 5: 5¹ = 5

LCM(36, 40, 48) = 2⁴ × 3² × 5 = 16 × 9 × 5 = 720 seconds

Now, convert seconds to minutes:
720 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 12 minutes

Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
# Answer option: ['A)1/18', 'B)1/9', 'C)23/90', 'D)5/18', 'E)13/45']","Here's how to solve this probability problem:

**1. Probability of Alan answering correctly without cheating:**

* Alan's probability of answering correctly is 1/5.

**2. Probability of Roger answering correctly (cheating):**

* Roger's probability of answering correctly is 2/3.

**3. Probability of Peter answering correctly (not cheating):**

* Peter's probability of answering correctly is 5/6.

**4. Probability of the question being answered correctly without cheating:**

We need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.  Since Alan, Roger, and Peter are independent events, we can calculate this as follows:

* **Probability that Alan answers correctly and Roger and Peter do not:**  (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/90
* **Probability that Peter answers correctly and Alan and Roger do not:** (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (5/6) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = 20/90

* **Total probability of correct answer without cheating:** 1/90 + 20/90 = 21/90 = 7/30

However, none of the answer choices match 7/30. Let's re-examine the approach.  The question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly *but not via cheating*. This means we only consider Alan and Peter's probabilities of success.  We assume their successes are independent events.


* **Probability only Alan answers correctly:** (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/90
* **Probability only Peter answers correctly:** (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (5/6) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = 20/90
* **Probability that either Alan OR Peter answers correctly (but not both, and not Roger):**  This is the sum of the two probabilities above: 1/90 + 20/90 = 21/90. This simplifies to 7/30.

There must be a mistake in the provided answer choices or the question's wording concerning the independence of the events.  21/90 simplifies to 7/30, which is not among the options.  Let's assume the question intends to ask for the probability that *at least one* person answers correctly without cheating:

P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(both correct) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/6) = 1/5 + 4/6 = 6/30 + 20/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.  This is also not an option.

There's a discrepancy.  The problem statement needs clarification on whether we want the probability that only one of them gets it right without cheating or whether at least one gets it right without cheating.  Given the options, none of the calculations seem to match.  There's an error in the question or the given options.

# Answer option: ['A)10%', 'B)12%', 'C)6%', 'D)8%', 'E)4%']","Let P be the principal amount, R be the rate of interest, and T be the time period in years.
Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100
Compound Interest (CI) = P(1 + R/100)^T - P

Given:
P = 5000
T = 2 years
Difference between CI and SI = 72

SI = (5000 * R * 2) / 100 = 100R
CI = 5000(1 + R/100)² - 5000

CI - SI = 72
5000(1 + R/100)² - 5000 - 100R = 72
5000(1 + 2R/100 + R²/10000) - 5000 - 100R = 72
5000 + 100R + R²/2 - 5000 - 100R = 72

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)70', 'C)75', 'D)100', 'E)125']","Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.
Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.
Let B be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
Total number of files = 250
Number of files infected only by a worm = W - B = 2.5B  (1)
50% of files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of 250 = 125.  Therefore, V = 125.
Total number of files = files infected by virus only + files infected by worm only + files infected by both
250 = (V - B) + (W - B) + B
250 = V + W - B
Since V = 125, we have:
250 = 125 + W - B
W - B = 125   (2)
From (1) and (2):
W - B = 2.5B = 125

B = 125 / 3.5 = 1250/35 = 250/7 ≈ 35.7  This is not a whole number, which is unexpected given the context. Let's re-examine the problem.


Let's use a different approach.
Total files = 250
Files not infected by virus = 50% of 250 = 125
These 125 files must be infected only by a worm.
Therefore, files infected only by worm = 125
Files infected only by worm = 2.5 * (files infected by both)
125 = 2.5 * (files infected by both)
Files infected by both = 125 / 2.5 = 50
Files infected by virus only = Total files - files infected only by worm - files infected by both
Files infected by virus only = 250 - 125 - 50 = 75
Total files infected by virus = Files infected by virus only + Files infected by both = 75 + 50 = 125 (This confirms our earlier calculation)
Files not infected by worm = Total files - (files infected by worm only + files infected by both)
Files not infected by worm = 250 - (125 + 50) = 250 - 175 = 75

Mohan's age is 23 and Sohan's age is 24. They will both be 26 years old in 3 and 2 years respectively.

The amount Mohan will receive after 3 years at 4% compound interest is:
M(1 + 0.04)^3 = M(1.04)^3 = 1.124864M

The amount Sohan will receive after 2 years at 4% compound interest is:
S(1 + 0.04)^2 = S(1.04)^2 = 1.0816S

Since they will receive equal amounts at the age of 26, we have:
1.124864M = 1.0816S
S = (1.124864/1.0816)M ≈ 1.04M

Substitute this into M + S = 5100:
M + 1.04M = 5100

# Answer option: ['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']","Here's how to solve the coin problem:

**1. Find the volume of the alloy coin:**

* The coin is cylindrical, so its volume is given by V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (thickness).
* The diameter is 15 mm, so the radius is 7.5 mm.
* The thickness is 2 mm.
* V = π * (7.5 mm)² * 2 mm ≈ 353.43 mm³

**2. Determine the volume of aluminum and silver:**

* The volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, so each occupies half the total volume:
* Volume of aluminum = Volume of silver = 353.43 mm³ / 2 ≈ 176.71 mm³

**3. Find the density of the alloy:**

* Density is mass/volume.  The total mass is 30 grams.
* Density of alloy = 30 grams / 353.43 mm³ ≈ 0.0848 g/mm³

**4. Determine the density of aluminum and silver:**

* Let the density of aluminum be ρ_aluminum.  Since silver is twice as heavy, its density is 2ρ_aluminum.
* The total mass of the alloy is the sum of the masses of aluminum and silver:
   30 grams = (ρ_aluminum * 176.71 mm³) + (2ρ_aluminum * 176.71 mm³) = 3 * ρ_aluminum * 176.71 mm³
* Solving for ρ_aluminum: ρ_aluminum ≈ 0.0565 g/mm³
* Therefore, the density of silver is 2 * 0.0565 g/mm³ ≈ 0.113 g/mm³

**5. Calculate the volume of the pure aluminum coin:**

* The new coin is 1 mm thick and has a diameter of 30 mm (radius 15 mm).
* Volume of new coin = π * (15 mm)² * 1 mm ≈ 706.86 mm³

**6. Find the mass of the pure aluminum coin:**

The question asks for the largest *integral* value of k.  Since k must be less than 6.25, the largest integer value is 6.  Since 6 is not an option, there must be an error in the provided options.  Let's check the options:

If k=9, discriminant = 25 - 36 = -11 (no real roots)
If k=7, discriminant = 25 - 28 = -3 (no real roots)
If k=3, discriminant = 25 - 12 = 13 (two real distinct roots)
If k=8, discriminant = 25 - 32 = -7 (no real roots)
If k=12, discriminant = 25 - 48 = -23 (no real roots)

The only option that gives two real and distinct roots is k=3.

209,"Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km
# Answer option: ['A)9 hours.', 'B)10 hours.', 'C)11 hours.', 'D)12 hours.', 'E)13 hours.']","Shweta rides at 10 km/hr.  To cover 100 km without stops, it would take her 100 km / 10 km/hr = 10 hours.

However, she takes a 10-minute break every 15 km.  She'll cover 100 km in 100 km / 15 km/stop = 6.67 stops.  Since she can't have a fraction of a stop, she'll take 7 stops.

The total rest time is 7 stops * 10 minutes/stop = 70 minutes = 70/60 hours = 7/6 hours.

Total time = 10 hours + 7/6 hours = 10 + 1.167 hours = 11.167 hours.

Rounding up to the nearest hour (since she can't travel a fraction of an hour) gives approximately 12 hours.

210,"Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways?
# Answer option: ['A)22 hrs', 'B)18 hrs', 'C)16 hrs', 'D)20 hrs', 'E)13 hrs']","Let T be the time taken to travel one way by train, and C be the time taken to travel one way by car.
We are given that the total time taken to go by train one way and return by car is 17 hours.  So, we have:
T + C = 17  (Equation 1)

If he goes both ways by train, the total time is 17 - 4 = 13 hours.  So, we have:
2T = 13  (Equation 2)

From Equation 2, we find T = 13/2 = 6.5 hours.

Substitute T = 6.5 into Equation 1:
6.5 + C = 17
C = 17 - 6.5 = 10.5 hours

If he traveled both ways by car, the total time would be 2C = 2 * 10.5 = 21 hours.  However, 21 is not among the answer choices. Let's re-examine the problem.

Let's use a different approach. Let the time taken by train be 't' hours and the time taken by car be 'c' hours, for a one-way trip.
We have: t + c = 17 (1)
and 2t = 17 - 4 = 13  => t = 13/2 = 6.5 hours.
Substituting in (1): 6.5 + c = 17 => c = 17 - 6.5 = 10.5 hours.
Time taken for both ways by car would be 2c = 2 * 10.5 = 21 hours.

There must be an error in the question or answer choices, as 21 hours is not an option. Let's check the reasoning again.

The problem states that he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. This means that the time difference between traveling both ways by train and one way by train and one way by car is 4 hours.
Let t be the time for a one-way train journey and c be the time for a one-way car journey.
We have: t + c = 17
2t = 17 - 4 = 13
t = 6.5
c = 17 - 6.5 = 10.5
The time for both ways by car is 2c = 2 * 10.5 = 21 hours.  Since 21 is not an option, there's a problem with the question or answer choices.

Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
# Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)25%', 'C)30%', 'D)35%', 'E)40%']","Let the initial amount of dog food be 1 unit.

At 8:00 am, the dog eats (1/3) * 1 = 1/3 unit. Remaining food = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 unit.
At 9:00 am, the dog eats (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 unit. Remaining food = 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9 unit.
At 10:00 am, the dog eats (1/3) * (4/9) = 4/27 unit. Remaining food = 4/9 - 4/27 = 8/27 unit.
At 11:00 am, the dog eats (1/3) * (8/27) = 8/81 unit. Remaining food = 8/27 - 8/81 = 16/81 unit.

# Answer option: ['A)100', 'B)120', 'C)50', 'D)200', 'E)80']","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Men who prefer green:**  We know 10 men preferred green cars more than red.  Since 75% preferred red, this means 25% preferred green (100% - 75% = 25%).

2. **Total number of men:** If 25% of men is 10, then the total number of men surveyed is 10 / 0.25 = 40 men.

3. **Total number of women:** Since 60% of the survey participants were women, and there were 40 men (40% of the total), then there are 40 / 0.40 * 0.60 = 60 women.

4. **Total number of people surveyed:** The total number of people is the sum of men and women: 40 + 60 = 100 people.

875 = bN + R   (where 'b' is the quotient when 875 is divided by N)

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
2272 - 875 = (a - b)N
1397 = (a - b)N

This means that N is a divisor of 1397.  Since N is a 3-digit number, we need to find the 3-digit divisors of 1397.

* Interest (I) = Rs. 300
* Time (T) = 3 years

We need to find the rate of interest (R).  Let's rearrange the formula to solve for R:

R = Interest / (Principal × Time)

R = 300 / (5000 × 3) 
R = 300 / 15000
R = 0.02

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

R = 0.02 × 100 = 2%

# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)28', 'C)46', 'D)66', 'E)70']","Let's denote the three types of candy bars as follows:
- Type A: 3 bars costing $0.50 each
- Type B: 4 bars costing $1.00 each
- Type C: 4 bars costing $2.00 each

We want to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that their total cost is more than $4.00. Let's analyze the possible combinations:

**Case 1: Three $2 candy bars**
This combination costs $6.00, which is more than $4.00. There is only 1 way to do this: (C, C, C).  Number of ways = ⁴C₃ = 4

**Case 2: Two $2 candy bars and one other**
This combination costs $5.00, which is more than $4.00.  There are two possibilities for the ""other"" bar:
* Two $2 bars and one $1 bar: (C, C, B). Number of ways = ⁴C₂ * ⁴C₁ = 6 * 4 = 24
* Two $2 bars and one $0.50 bar: (C, C, A). Number of ways = ⁴C₂ * ³C₁ = 6 * 3 = 18

**Case 3: One $2 candy bar and two others**
* One $2 bar and two $1 bars: (C, B, B).  This costs $4.00, which is not more than $4.00, so we exclude this.
* One $2 bar and two $0.50 bars: (C, A, A). This costs $3.00, which is not more than $4.00, so we exclude this.
* One $2 bar, one $1 bar and one $0.50 bar. (C, B, A). This costs $3.50, which is not more than $4.00, so we exclude this.

**Total Combinations:**
Adding up the number of ways from the cases we considered:

237,"At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
# Answer option: ['A)120', 'B)19', 'C)180', 'D)420', 'E)460']","The total number of people in the team is 8 (4 men + 4 women).
The number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people is given by the combination formula:
⁸C₄ = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!) = 8! / (4! * 4!) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 70

However, we must subtract the cases where the group is composed of only men or only women.
The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 men is:
⁴C₄ = 1
The number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 women is:
⁴C₄ = 1

So, the number of groups with only men or only women is 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen without having only men or only women is:
70 - 2 = 68

Since 68 is not among the answer choices, let's re-examine the problem.  The question states that the team *cannot* be composed of only men or only women.  This implies that the team must have a mix of men and women.

238,"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)100', 'C)150', 'D)200', 'E)70']","Let the total number of children in the class be T.
The fraction of girls in the class is 2/5.
The fraction of boys in the class is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.
The number of boys is given as 100.
So, (3/5)T = 100
T = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3  This is not a whole number, which is not possible since the number of children must be a whole number. There must be a mistake in the problem statement.  Let's assume the fraction of girls is actually 2/3 and the number of boys is 100.

If 2/3 of the class are girls, then 1/3 of the class are boys.

If (1/3)T = 100 then T=300.

The number of girls is (2/3) * 300 = 200.
If we assume the fraction of girls is 2/5, then there are 3 parts that are boys and 2 parts that are girls.
Let's say that the number of boys is 3x and the number of girls is 2x.
The total number of children is 5x, where 3x are boys and 2x are girls.
Given 3x = 100, x = 100/3.
This means there are 2x = 2 * (100/3) = 200/3 girls, which isn't a whole number. The given information is inconsistent and impossible.

Let's re-examine the problem. If 2/5 of the children are girls, then 3/5 are boys.
Let G be the number of girls and B be the number of boys.
We are given that B = 100.
The ratio of girls to boys is 2:3.
So, G/B = 2/3
G/100 = 2/3
G = (2/3) * 100 = 200/3 which is not a whole number.

There's an error in the problem statement.  The provided options are incorrect.  The calculation suggests there are approximately 66.67 girls, which is not a whole number. None of the given answers are correct.

# Answer option: ['A)5/7', 'B)3/5', 'C)4/7', 'D)2/5', 'E)2/7']","The prime factorization of 1000 is 2³ * 5³.  A number is relatively prime to 1000 if it shares no common factors with 2 or 5.

To find the number of integers from 1 to 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Let A be the set of integers divisible by 2, and B be the set of integers divisible by 5.  We want to find the number of integers not in A or B.

|A| = 1000/2 = 500
|B| = 1000/5 = 200
|A ∩ B| = 1000/(2*5) = 100 (integers divisible by both 2 and 5, i.e., divisible by 10)

The number of integers divisible by 2 or 5 is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 500 + 200 - 100 = 600.

The number of integers from 1 to 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000 is 1000 - 600 = 400.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from S is relatively prime to 1000 is:

# Answer option: ['A)$45,000', 'B)$50,000', 'C)$54,000', 'D)$59,000', 'E)$62,000']","Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Compound Interest:**

The formula for compound interest is: A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

**Applying the Formula:**

In this case:

* A = $54,080
* r = 8% = 0.08
* n = 2 (semi-annual compounding)
* t = 1 year

We need to solve for P (the principal amount).  Let's plug in the values:

$54,080 = P (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
$54,080 = P (1 + 0.04)^2
$54,080 = P (1.04)^2
$54,080 = P (1.0816)
P = $54,080 / 1.0816
P = $50,000

Therefore, Charles originally invested $50,000.

# Answer option: ['A)45', 'B)48', 'C)50', 'D)55', 'E)58']","Let J, S, and F represent the current ages of Joe, Joe's sister, and Joe's father, respectively.
We are given that J + S + F = 100.

When Joe is as old as his father, his age will be F.  The time elapsed will be F - J.
At that time, Joe's sister's age will be S + (F - J) = 2S.
This gives us the equation: F - J = S.

When Joe is as old as his father (age F), his father's age will be F + (F - J).
When Joe's sister was as old as her father (age F), her age was F. The time elapsed since then is F - S.
At that time, the father's age was F - (F - S) = S.
So, when Joe is as old as his father, his father's age is twice what it was when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This gives us the equation:
F + (F - J) = 2S
2F - J = 2S

Now we have a system of three equations:
1) J + S + F = 100
2) F - J = S
3) 2F - J = 2S

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
J + (F - J) + F = 100
2F = 100
F = 50

Substitute equation (2) into equation (3):
2F - J = 2(F - J)
2F - J = 2F - 2J
J = 0  This is not possible as Joe must have a positive age.  There's a flaw in our interpretation of the problem statement.  Let's re-examine the last sentence:

""When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.""

Let's say when the sister was the father's age (F), the father's age was x.  Then when Joe reaches the father's age (F), the father's age is 2x.  The time difference is F - S for the sister and F - J for Joe.
So F - S = F - x  => x = S
And F - J = 2x - x = x  =>  x = F - J
Therefore, S = F - J.

Now we have:
1) J + S + F = 100
2) S = F - J

Substitute (2) into (1):
J + (F - J) + F = 100
2F = 100
F = 50

# Answer option: ['A)y/400', 'B)4y', 'C)50y', 'D)2500/y', 'E)5000/y']","**Explanation:**

1. **Translate the given information into equations:**
   - ""x is m percent of 4y"" can be written as: x = (m/100) * 4y

2. **Solve for m in terms of x and y:**
   - Multiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4my
   - Divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x) / (4y) = 25x / y

3. **Determine the percentage:**
   - We want to find what percentage m is of x.  This means we want to find (m/x) * 100.
   - Substitute the expression for m from step 2: [(25x / y) / x] * 100
   - Simplify: (25/y) * 100 = 2500/y

Therefore, m is (2500/y)% of x.

# Answer option: ['A)58', 'B)62', 'C)66', 'D)70', 'E)74']","Let the length of the rectangular yard be L meters and the width be W meters.
The area of the rectangular yard is given as 240 square meters.  Therefore, L * W = 240.
One side of the yard, which is 10 meters, will not be fenced.  Let's assume this unfenced side is the width, so W = 10 meters.
Substituting W = 10 into the area equation, we get:
L * 10 = 240
L = 240 / 10 = 24 meters
Alice needs to fence three sides:  one length (L) and two widths (W).
The total fencing needed is L + 2W = 24 + 2(10) = 24 + 20 = 44 meters.

However, the question is asking for the total fencing needed which would be the perimeter of the rectangle minus the unfenced side.

Let the three consecutive integers be n-1, n, and n+1.  Their product is (n-1)n(n+1) = n(n²-1).  We are given that the sum of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Therefore:

(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n = 2184
n = 2184 / 3 = 728

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 727, 728, and 729. Their sum is:

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

The question asks for the *sum* of the three consecutive integers.  We've already calculated this sum which is 2184. However, none of the answer options match 2184. There's a mistake in the problem statement. The problem likely meant to ask for the *sum* of the three consecutive integers, not the *product*.

Let's re-interpret the question. If the question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is close to the cube root of 2184.

∛2184 ≈ 12.95

Let's try integers around 13: 12 * 13 * 14 = 2184.  This works.
