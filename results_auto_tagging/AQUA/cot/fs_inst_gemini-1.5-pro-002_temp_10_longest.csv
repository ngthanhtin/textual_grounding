0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","Let the height of the tower be h. Let the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower be x.
When the angle of elevation is 45°, tan(45°) = h/x, so x = h.
Let the speed of the car be v. After 10 minutes, the distance traveled is 10v/60 = v/6.
The new distance from the base of the tower is x - v/6 = h - v/6.
When the angle of elevation is 60°, tan(60°) = h / (h - v/6), so √3 = h / (h - v/6).
√3(h - v/6) = h
√3h - (√3/6)v = h
(√3 - 1)h = (√3/6)v
v = 6(√3 - 1)h / √3
The remaining distance to the base of the tower is h - v/6.
Time taken to cover the remaining distance = (h - v/6) / v
= (h - (6(√3 - 1)h / √3)/6) / (6(√3 - 1)h / √3)
= (h - (√3 - 1)h / √3) / (6(√3 - 1)h / √3)
= (√3h - (√3 - 1)h) / (6(√3 - 1)h)
= (√3h - √3h + h) / (6(√3 - 1)h)
= h / (6(√3 - 1)h)
= 1 / (6(√3 - 1))
Time = 1/(6(√3 - 1)) hours
= 60/(6(√3 - 1)) minutes
= 10/(√3 - 1) minutes
= 10(√3 + 1)/(3 - 1) minutes
= 5(√3 + 1) minutes

Answer: {A)5(√3 + 1)}

1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
# Answer option: ['A)$61', 'B)$65', 'C)$67.40', 'D)$70', 'E)$78.20']","Let the original price be 'x'.
The discounted price is x - 0.22x = 0.78x.
The customer paid 0.78x - 20.
This amount is $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90.
Simplifying the equation: 0.78x - 0.5x = 1.90 + 20
0.28x = 21.90
x = 21.90 / 0.28
x = 78.214 ≈ $78.20

2,"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?
# Answer option: ['A)36', 'B)15', 'C)17', 'D)5', 'E)7']","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12:**  The multiples of 9 are 9, 18, 27, 36, 45...  The multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48... The smallest number that appears in both lists is 36.

3,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
# Answer option: ['A)0.22', 'B)0.26', 'C)0.37', 'D)0.46', 'E)0.63']","Here's how to solve this:

* **Probability of Stock A *not* increasing:** 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
* **Probability of Stock B *not* increasing:** 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

Since we want the greatest probability that *neither* event occurs, we assume the events are independent. In this scenario, the events not happening don't influence each other.  We then multiply the individual probabilities:

* **Probability of neither A nor B increasing:** 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144

Since the question asks for the *greatest* value, and 0.1144 is less than both 0.26 (Stock B not increasing) and 0.44 (Stock A not increasing),  the greatest probability that neither event will occur happens when Stock B doesn't increase (0.26).  This means it's possible that A *does* increase.

4,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
# Answer option: ['A)270', 'B)300', 'C)280', 'D)320', 'E)315']","Let the cost price of the article be 'x'.
The trader sold the article at a profit of 20%.
So, the selling price is x + (20/100)x = x + 0.2x = 1.2x
Given that the selling price is Rs. 360.
Therefore, 1.2x = 360
x = 360 / 1.2

5,"20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
# Answer option: ['A)40', 'B)200', 'C)380', 'D)400', 'E)3200']","Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Second pull:** 1 out of 20 marbles was black, meaning 1/20 = 5% of the marbles pulled were black.
* **Percentage assumption:** The problem states this 5% represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag.
* **Finding the total:**  If 20 black marbles represent 5% of the total marbles, then the total number of marbles (Q) can be found by setting up a proportion:

   20 / Q = 5 / 100

# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)11.5', 'C)12.5', 'D)13.5', 'E)15']","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Calculate the total distance:** Distance = Speed * Time = 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles

2. **Calculate the distance covered before the rain:** Quarter distance = 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the first quarter:** Time = Distance / Speed = 250 miles / 100 mph = 2.5 hours

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:** Remaining distance = 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance in the rain:** Time = Distance / Speed = 750 miles / 75 mph = 10 hours

# Answer option: ['A)27', 'B)81', 'C)90', 'D)99', 'E)110']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Maximum who didn't attend prom:** If at least 45% attended, then at most 100% - 45% = 55% did not attend.  55% of 200 students is 0.55 * 200 = 110 students.

2. **Maximum who didn't attend debate:** If at least 35% attended the debate, then at most 100% - 35% = 65% did not attend. 65% of 200 students is 0.65 * 200 = 130 students.

3. **Maximum who didn't attend either:** The maximum number of students who could have done neither is the smaller of the two numbers calculated above, because some students may have skipped both events. In this case, the smaller number is 110.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
# Answer option: ['A)226', 'B)230', 'C)240', 'D)260', 'E)280']","Production cost per component = $110
Number of components produced per month = 420
Number of components produced per year = 420 * 12 = 5040
Total production cost per year = 5040 * $110 = $554,400
Desired yearly profit = $626,400
Total revenue needed = Total production cost + Desired yearly profit
Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
Minimum selling price per component = Total revenue needed / Number of components produced per year

# Answer option: ['A)1 step/minute', 'B)2 step/minute', 'C)3 step/minute', 'D)4 step/minute', 'E)None of the above']","Let 's' be the speed of the escalator (in steps/minute). Let 'n' be the total number of steps.
Case 1: Walking 20 steps and reaching the bottom in 10 minutes.
Steps covered by walking = 20
Steps covered by escalator = n - 20
Time taken = 10 minutes
Speed of escalator = (n - 20) / 10 = s

Case 2: Walking 10 steps and reaching the bottom in 20 minutes.
Steps covered by walking = 10
Steps covered by escalator = n - 10
Time taken = 20 minutes
Speed of escalator = (n - 10) / 20 = s

Now we have two equations:
(n - 20) / 10 = s
(n - 10) / 20 = s

Equating the two expressions for 's':
(n - 20) / 10 = (n - 10) / 20
2(n - 20) = n - 10

# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)16', 'C)17', 'D)18', 'E)19']","Let 'a' be the number of toys Alex makes and 'j' be the number of toys Jacob makes.
We are given that a + j = 35.
Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total time Alex works is 7a hours.
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total time Jacob works is 9j hours.
We are given that they work for a similar number of hours, so 7a ≈ 9j.
We have two equations:
1. a + j = 35

# Answer option: ['A)126km', 'B)144km', 'C)127km', 'D)228km', 'E)128km']","Let the distance be 'd' km.
Let the speed in the forward journey be 's' km/hr.
Time taken in forward journey = 6 hours
So, distance = speed × time
d = s × 6
d = 6s

In the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr. So, the speed in the return journey is (s + 12) km/hr.
Time taken in return journey = 4 hours
Distance = speed × time
d = (s + 12) × 4
d = 4s + 48

Since the distance is the same in both journeys, we can equate the two expressions for d:
6s = 4s + 48
2s = 48
s = 24 km/hr

Now, we can find the distance:
d = 6s
d = 6 × 24
d = 144 km

30,"The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
# Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)28%', 'C)36%', 'D)40%', 'E)42%']","Let the wholesale cost of the appliance be 'w'.
The original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost.
Original retail price = w + 0.60w = 1.60w

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price.
Selling price = 1.60w - (0.20 * 1.60w)
Selling price = 1.60w - 0.32w
Selling price = 1.28w

The selling price is 1.28w, and the wholesale cost is w.
The difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is 1.28w - w = 0.28w.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100.
Percentage increase = (0.28w / w) * 100
Percentage increase = 0.28 * 100
Percentage increase = 28%

32,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
# Answer option: ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']","Let the length of the rectangular sheet be 'l' and the width be 'w'.
When folded along the length, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. The dimensions of each half are l and w/2. So, the perimeter is 2(l + w/2) = 48, which simplifies to 2l + w = 48.
When folded along the width, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. The dimensions of each half are l/2 and w. So, the perimeter is 2(l/2 + w) = 66, which simplifies to l + 2w = 66.
Now we have two equations:
1) 2l + w = 48
2) l + 2w = 66

Multiply equation (2) by 2: 2l + 4w = 132.
Subtract equation (1) from this new equation: (2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 132 - 48, which simplifies to 3w = 84.
So, w = 84/3 = 28.
Substitute w = 28 into equation (1): 2l + 28 = 48, so 2l = 20, and l = 10.
The area of the rectangular sheet is l * w = 10 * 28 = 280 cm². However, none of the answer choices match this. Let's double-check our calculations.

2l+w=48
l+2w=66

Multiply first eq by 2: 4l+2w=96
Subtract second equation: 3l = 30, l=10
Then w = 48-20=28

Area = 10*28=280.

However, the question states that the sheet was folded into two equal halves.  We calculated based on the perimeter of one half, meaning the total perimeter before folding along the length was 48 * 2 = 96, and before folding along the width it was 66 * 2 = 132.
So, 2(l+w) = 96 => l+w = 48
and 2(l+w) = 132 => l+w = 66
This doesn't make sense.
The perimeter when folded along the length is 2(l+w/2) = 48 so 2l+w=48
The perimeter when folded along the width is 2(w+l/2) = 66 so l+2w=66

From the first equation w=48-2l. Substitute this into the second to get l+2(48-2l)=66
l+96-4l=66
-3l=-30, so l=10. w=48-20=28.
Area = 28*10 = 280. None of the answer choices match.

2(l+w/2) = 48, so 2l + w = 48
2(w+l/2) = 66, so l + 2w = 66
Multiply the second equation by 2: 2l + 4w = 132
Subtract the first equation from this: 3w = 84, so w = 28
Then 2l + 28 = 48, so 2l = 20, and l = 10.
Area is 10 * 28 = 280.

The answer options seem wrong.
2l + w = 48
l + 2w = 66
Multiply 1 by 2 and subtract 2nd equation: 3l = 30, l=10.
w=28, area = 280.

Final Answer: The correct answer is not provided in the answer choices. The calculated area is 280.

# Answer option: ['A)Rs. 697.50', 'B)Rs. 712.50', 'C)Rs. 787.50', 'D)Rs. 750', 'E)Rs. 780']","Here's how to solve this problem:

Let the marked price (MP) of the watch be 'x'.

**Scenario 1: 5% discount**
* Selling price (SP1) = x - (5/100)x = 0.95x
* Let the cost price be 'c'.
* Profit1 = 0.95x - c

**Scenario 2: 7% discount**
* Selling price (SP2) = x - (7/100)x = 0.93x
* Profit2 = 0.93x - c

We're given that Profit1 - Profit2 = Rs. 15

Substituting the profit expressions:
(0.95x - c) - (0.93x - c) = 15
0.95x - c - 0.93x + c = 15
0.02x = 15
x = 15 / 0.02
x = 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

The student was supposed to find (7/8)x.
Instead, the student found (7/18)x.

The difference between the correct value and the student's value is given as 770.  So we set up the equation:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770

To solve for x, first find a common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72.  Rewrite the fractions:

(63/72)x - (28/72)x = 770

(35/72)x = 770

Now, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:

Total sharpeners = x + y = 18
Let the cost of each brown sharpener be 'b' rupees.
The cost of each white sharpener is 'b+1' rupees.
Total cost = bx + (b+1)y = 100

From the first equation, y = 18 - x
Substituting this into the second equation:

# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)15', 'C)12', 'D)6', 'E)3']","Here's how to solve this:

* **Hose A's rate:** Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour.

* **Hose A's contribution:** In the first 2 hours, Hose A filled (1/8) * 2 = 1/4 of the pool.

# Answer option: ['A)7', 'B)8', 'C)10', 'D)11', 'E)12']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Mr. Brown's work:** Mr. Brown works for 8 days and can paint a house in 6 days. So, he completes 8/6 = 4/3 houses.

2. **Mr. Black's work:** Mr. Black works for 6 days and can paint a house in 8 days. So, he completes 6/8 = 3/4 of a house.

3. **Combined work of Brown and Black:** Together, they complete 4/3 + 3/4 = (16 + 9)/12 = 25/12 houses.

4. **Remaining work:** Since there are 3 houses total, the remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36 - 25)/12 = 11/12 of a house.

5. **Mr. Blue's work:** Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days.  To complete the remaining 11/12 of a house, he'll take (11/12) * 12 = 11 days.

56,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
# Answer option: ['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Inner cube dimensions:** Since the outer cube is 5x5x5 cm and the thickness is 1 cm, the inner cube's dimensions are 3x3x3 cm (5 - 2*1 = 3).

2. **Small cubes in the inner cube:** The inner cube is made up of 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 smaller cubes.

3. **Unpainted faces of inner cubes:** Each of these 27 smaller cubes has 6 faces, and *all* of these faces are unpainted because they are inside the hollow cube. So, there are 27 * 6 = 162 unpainted faces.

4. **Small cubes in the shell (outer - inner):** The outer cube has 5*5*5 = 125 small cubes. Subtracting the inner cube's small cubes (27) leaves 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes forming the shell.

5. **Unpainted faces of shell cubes:** The small cubes forming the shell have some faces exposed to the outside (painted) and some hidden inside.  We can think of the inner surfaces of the hollow cube.  Each inner surface is 3x3 small cubes, and there are 6 such surfaces, so there are 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 inner faces. Thus, there are 54 unpainted faces on the cubes in the shell.

6. **Total unpainted faces:**  The total number of unpainted faces is the sum of the unpainted faces from the inner cube and the unpainted faces in the shell: 162 + 54 = 216 faces for the inner cubes, and 54 unpainted faces from the shell, for a total of 162 + 54 = 216 unpainted inner faces, and 54 unpainted outer faces, so 216 + 54 *5 = 216+270 = 486

7. **Total unpainted smaller cube faces:** Each of the inner 27 cubes have all 6 faces unpainted (27*6=162). The number of unpainted small cube faces on the shell can be found by considering the inner surfaces of the hollow cube. Each inner surface has dimensions of 3x3 small cubes, making 9 small cube faces. Since the hollow cube has 6 inner surfaces, there are 6x9 = 54 unpainted small cube faces on the shell.  Adding these together, we have 162 + 54 = 216. The outer layer has 5x5x5 - 3x3x3 = 125 - 27 = 98 cubes.  Their internal faces are 98*6 - 6*(9) = 588-54 = 534.  We have to consider each cube and calculate which faces are internal. The correct way: Outer volume is 5^3 = 125 Inner volume is 3^3 = 27 Cubes not painted are 125-27 = 98 cubes in outer shell + 27 internal cubes The internal 27 have all their 6 faces unpainted - so 27*6=162 unpainted faces The 98 outer cubes have at least one painted face, so they have some unpainted faces. On the internal surfaces of the hollow cube, there are 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 such unpainted faces. In total, there are 162 + 54 = 216 unpainted faces belonging to 98 + 27 cubes.
5x5x5-3x3x3 = 98
98 cubes and 27 cubes. Total = 125
Inner cubes: 27 x 6 = 162
Outer cubes: 54 faces, which are exposed to the inner part.
Unpainted: 162+54= 216. In case of inside 3x3 faces, means 9x6 = 54 faces.
5x5x5 = 125 cubes
3x3x3= 27
125-27=98
27 x 6= 162
98x5=490. 162+490=652. 162+54=216
Small cubes=5x5x5=125
Thickness 1 cm. So small cubes of size 1x1x1
Inner core: (5-2)x(5-2)x(5-2)=3x3x3=27 small cubes
Total: 125-27=98 small cubes
Each face has (5-2)x(5-2) = 9 faces
There are 6 faces so 9x6=54 faces are unpainted
Total unpainted: 98+27= 125

59,"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
# Answer option: ['A)47', 'B)91', 'C)41', 'D)67', 'E)44']","Let the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers be x, x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8.
Their sum is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20.
When this sum is divided by 10, we get (5x + 20)/10 = (x+4)/2.
We are given that (x+4)/2 is a perfect square. Let's say (x+4)/2 = k^2, where k is an integer.
So, x+4 = 2k^2, which implies x = 2k^2 - 4.
Since x is a two-digit odd number, x must be between 11 and 99.
Thus, 11 <= 2k^2 - 4 <= 99
15 <= 2k^2 <= 103
7.5 <= k^2 <= 51.5
Since k^2 is a perfect square, the possible values for k^2 are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49.
If k^2 = 9, x = 2(9) - 4 = 14 (not odd)
If k^2 = 16, x = 2(16) - 4 = 28 (not odd)
If k^2 = 25, x = 2(25) - 4 = 46 (not odd)
If k^2 = 36, x = 2(36) - 4 = 68 (not odd)
If k^2 = 49, x = 2(49) - 4 = 94 (not odd)
It seems there's an issue, let's check x+4 = 2k^2 and x is an odd number.
If k^2 is odd and let x = 2n+1. Then 2n+5 = 2k^2
n+2.5 = k^2. n = k^2-2.5, which is impossible since n must be an integer.
2k^2 must be even and x+4 is also even since x is odd.

Since x is odd, let x = 2n-1, where n is an integer.
Then the sum is 5(2n-1)+20 = 10n-5+20 = 10n+15
(10n+15)/10 = n + 1.5 = a perfect square. This is impossible since n must be an integer.

Let the numbers be 2n+1, 2n+3, 2n+5, 2n+7, 2n+9 where n is an integer
Sum = 10n+25
(10n+25)/10 = n+2.5 which has to be a perfect square. Not possible.

If we consider the choices:
A) 47, 49, 51, 53, 55. Sum = 255, 255/10 = 25.5, not a perfect square.
B) 91, 93, 95, 97, 99. Sum = 475, 475/10 = 47.5, not a perfect square.
C) 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. Sum = 225, 225/10 = 22.5, not a perfect square.
D) 67, 69, 71, 73, 75. Sum = 355, 355/10 = 35.5, not a perfect square.

Students interested in Football = 8% of x = 0.08x
Students interested in Cricket = (4/5) of x = 0.8x
Students interested in Basketball = 10% of x = 0.1x
Students not interested in any game = 20
Total students = Students interested in Football + Students interested in Cricket + Students interested in Basketball + Students not interested in any game
x = 0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20

The question states, ""Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T"".  This can be expressed as two equations:
1. r - q = q - t
2. r + t = 50

From equation 1, we can simplify to:
r + t = 2q

Substituting equation 2 into the simplified equation 1:
50 = 2q
q = 25

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age (r - q).  We know q = 25.  We also know r + t = 50, but we don't have individual values for 'r' and 't'.  This means we can't definitively determine the value of 'r' and, therefore, can't determine the exact difference between R and Q's ages.

# Answer option: ['A)6', 'B)8', 'C)9', 'D)10', 'E)11']","Let 'n' be the number of matches played by Sachin before the final match.
His total runs before the final match = 51 * n
After the final match, the number of matches played becomes (n+1).
His total runs after the final match = 51n + 78
His new batting average is 54.
So, (51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54
51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)
51n + 78 = 54n + 54
78 - 54 = 54n - 51n

If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
# Answer option: ['A)3', 'B)4', 'C)5', 'D)10', 'E)20']","Let $n$ be the number of letters Amy needs.

If Amy uses single letters, she can represent $n$ types of books.
If Amy uses pairs of two different letters, she can represent $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ types of books.
The total number of types of books Amy can represent is $n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \geq 10$.

If $n=3$, we have $3 + \frac{3(2)}{2} = 3+3 = 6$. This is not enough.

# Answer option: ['A)60 m', 'B)61 m', 'C)62 m', 'D)63 m', 'E)64 m']","Let the breadth be 'b' meters.
The length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, which can be expressed as 4b + 1 meters.
The area of the rectangular piece is given by length * breadth, which is 150 sq m.
So, (4b + 1) * b = 150
4b² + b = 150
4b² + b - 150 = 0
We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula.
Using the quadratic formula:
b = [-1 ± √(1² - 4 * 4 * -150)] / (2 * 4)
b = [-1 ± √(1 + 2400)] / 8
b = [-1 ± √2401] / 8
b = [-1 ± 49] / 8
Since breadth cannot be negative, we take the positive value:
b = (49 - 1) / 8
b = 48 / 8
b = 6 meters
Now we find the length:
Length = 4b + 1 = 4 * 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 meters
The perimeter of the rectangle is given by 2 * (length + breadth):
Perimeter = 2 * (25 + 6)

# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)10', 'C)12', 'D)15', 'E)19']","Let L be the number of large cakes and S be the number of small cakes.
Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour or 35 small cakes per hour.
The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

Let x be the number of helpers making large cakes and y be the number of helpers making small cakes.
The total number of helpers is x + y.

The number of large cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours is 2 * 3 * x = 6x.
We need 20 large cakes, so 6x >= 20, or x >= 20/6 = 10/3 ≈ 3.33. Since x must be an integer, x >= 4.

The number of small cakes made by y helpers in 3 hours is 35 * 3 * y = 105y.
We need 700 small cakes, so 105y >= 700, or y >= 700/105 = 20/3 ≈ 6.67. Since y must be an integer, y >= 7.

If x = 4, they make 6 * 4 = 24 large cakes.
If y = 7, they make 105 * 7 = 735 small cakes.
In this case, the total number of helpers is 4 + 7 = 11.

Since the answer choices are 8, 10, 12, 15, and 19, and we have already determined that we need at least 4 helpers for large cakes and 7 helpers for small cakes, the minimum number of helpers is 11. The closest option to 11 is 10, but 10 helpers are not enough.

If we try 10 helpers: Let's say a helpers make large cakes and (10 - a) helpers make small cakes.
6a >= 20
105(10 - a) >= 700 => 1050 - 105a >= 700 => 105a <= 350 => a <= 350/105 ≈ 3.33

a >= 4 and a <= 3.33.  This is impossible, so 10 helpers is not enough.

The next smallest option is 12. If we use 4 helpers for large cakes and 8 for small cakes:
Large cakes: 4 * 2 * 3 = 24
Small cakes: 8 * 35 * 3 = 840

If we use 3 helpers for large cakes and 9 for small cakes:
Large cakes: 3 * 2 * 3 = 18 < 20, so this doesn't work.

Since 10 helpers wasn't enough and we found a solution with 12 helpers, we need 12 helpers.

2. **Find the length of RS:** We are given that RS = 5.

3. **Find the length of RT:** We are given that RT = 17.

4. **Determine the order of the points:** Since RT (17) is greater than RS (5), but less than ST (22), the points must be in the order R, S, T.

5. **Find the length of RU:**
   * We know RT = RS + ST
   * We found SU = 11
   * Since S is between R and T, and U is between S and T, we have RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16
   
   *OR*  Alternatively, Since RT=17 and TU=22/2=11, we have RT = RU + UT. So RU = RT - TU = 17-11=6.

# Answer option: ['A)12/25', 'B)3/2', 'C)3', 'D)2', 'E)25/3']","Let 'p' represent pita bread, 'r' represent rolls, and 'b' represent baguettes.
We are given:
1. 6p = 2r
2. 3r = 5b
We want to find the number of pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes, i.e., 2b = ?p

From 6p = 2r, we get r = 3p.
Substituting this into 3r = 5b, we get 3(3p) = 5b, which simplifies to 9p = 5b.

Now we want to find the equivalent of 2b in terms of p.  We can express b in terms of p:
b = (9/5)p

So, 2b = 2 * (9/5)p = (18/5)p = 3.6p ≈ 4 pita breads. Since there's not exact match let's express the relation in different ways.
We have 9p = 5b
We want to relate 2b to x * pita breads: 2b = xp
From 9p = 5b we have b = (9/5)p
So, 2b = 2*(9/5)p = 18p/5
Comparing 2b=xp and 2b = 18p/5 we get xp = (18/5)p
Hence x = 18/5 = 3.6.

So, 2 baguettes are equal to 18/5 pita breads, so the correct option is 18/5 = 3.6
We have 6p = 2r -> r = 3p
and 3r = 5b -> 3(3p) = 5b -> 9p = 5b
We want to find x such that 2b = xp
From 9p = 5b, b = 9p/5
2b = 2 * (9p/5) = 18p/5
So xp = 18p/5
x = 18/5 = 3.6

# Answer option: ['A)13x/2', 'B)13x/2 - 6', 'C)13x/24', 'D)(13x+1)/24', 'E)(13x-12)/24']","The width of x pickets is x * (1/2) = x/2 inches.
There are x-1 spaces between x pickets.
The total width of the spaces is (x-1) * 6 = 6x - 6 inches.
The total length of the fence in inches is (x/2) + (6x - 6) = (x/2) + (12x/2) - (12/2) = 13x/2 - 6 inches.

75,"A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
# Answer option: ['A)238', 'B)289', 'C)200', 'D)287', 'E)187']","Let the speed of the ship be 's' miles per hour.
The speed of the plane is 10s miles per hour.
The ship has already traveled 180 miles.
Let 't' be the time it takes for the plane and ship to meet.
Distance traveled by the ship = speed × time = s × t
Distance traveled by the plane = speed × time = 10s × t
When they meet, the plane will have traveled the same distance as the ship plus the 180 miles the ship already traveled.
So, 10s × t = 180 + s × t
9s × t = 180
t = 180 / 9s = 20 / s
Distance from the starting point when they meet is the distance traveled by the ship plus the initial 180 miles:
Distance = 180 + s × t
Distance = 180 + s × (20/s)
Distance = 180 + 20
Distance = 200 miles

What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
# Answer option: ['A)0.9', 'B)0.8', 'C)0.6', 'D)0.65', 'E)1.5']","Here's how to solve this probability problem:

1. **Time Difference:** The harbor line train arrives 2 minutes after the main line train.

2. **Favorable Outcome:** The man catches the harbor line train if he arrives at the station between the arrival of the main line train and the arrival of the harbor line train. This window is 2 minutes long.

3. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  The trains run every 10 minutes.  The man could arrive at any point within a 10-minute interval.

4. **Probability:** The probability is the ratio of the favorable outcome (2 minutes) to the total possible outcomes (10 minutes):  2/10 = 0.2

5. **Probability of catching the *first* train:**  Since the man wants to catch the *first* train, this includes catching *either* the main line train *or* the harbor line train. To get this, we calculate the probability of catching the harbor line first.

    The man catches the main line train if he arrives at the station before the harbor line comes in. This probability is equal to 8/10 =0.8

    The man catches the harbor line train if he arrives at the station after the main line leaves and before the harbor line comes in. This probability is equal to 2/10 =0.2

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
# Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']","Let P be the current population of Boomtown.
Let P1 be the population one year ago.
Let P2 be the population two years from now.

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.
So, P2 = P * (1 + 0.10)^2 = P * 1.1^2 = 1.21P
Also, P2 is double the population of one year ago.
P2 = 2 * P1

So, 1.21P = 2P1
P1 = (1.21/2)P = 0.605P

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in population over the last year.
The increase is P - P1 = P - 0.605P = 0.395P
The percentage increase is (0.395P / P1) * 100% = (0.395P / 0.605P) * 100% = (0.395/0.605) * 100% ≈ 65.29%

If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have S + 30 and Arjun will have A - 30.  According to the problem, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:
S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
S + 30 = 2A - 60
S = 2A - 90  (Equation 1)

If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have A + 10 and Sajal will have S - 10.  According to the problem, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:
A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
A + 10 = 3S - 30
A = 3S - 40 (Equation 2)

Now, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
A = 6A - 270 - 40
A = 6A - 310
5A = 310
A = 62

# Answer option: ['A)56', 'B)58', 'C)60', 'D)62', 'E)64']","Let the side of the original square piece of cloth be 's' feet.
After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the dimensions of the rectangular piece become (s) feet and (s-4) feet.
The area of the rectangular piece is s(s-4).
When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally, we get two triangles of equal area.
The area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle, which is (1/2) * s(s-4).
Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have:
(1/2) * s(s-4) = 70
s(s-4) = 140
s^2 - 4s = 140
s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
We need to find two numbers whose product is -140 and sum is -4. These numbers are -14 and 10.
(s - 14)(s + 10) = 0

85,"M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
# Answer option: ['A)20', 'B)30', 'C)40', 'D)200', 'E)None']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Express M and N:** M can be written as 100a + 10b + c, and N can be written as 100c + 10b + a.

2. **Substitute into the equation:**  Given M - N + 396c = 990, substitute the expressions for M and N:  (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990.

3. **Simplify:**  This simplifies to 99a - 99c + 396c = 990, which further simplifies to 99a + 297c = 990. Dividing the entire equation by 99, we get a + 3c = 10.

4. **Find possible values for a and c:** Since a and c are digits (0-9), we need to find pairs of a and c that satisfy this equation. Also, since M > N and M and N are three-digit numbers, neither 'a' nor 'c' can be 0. We are also looking for M > 300, which means a >= 3.

Here are the possible pairs:
* a = 1, c = 3 
* a = 4, c = 2
* a = 7, c = 1

Since 'b' can be any digit from 0 to 9, there are 10 possible values for 'b' for each pair of 'a' and 'c'.

However, we are only concerned with values of 'M' greater than 300, meaning 'a' must be greater than or equal to 3. This leaves us with two pairs:
* a = 4, c = 2 (b can be 0-9) - 10 possibilities
* a = 7, c = 1 (b can be 0-9) - 10 possibilities

This gives us a total of 20 possible values of M.

86,"there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
# Answer option: ['A)550', 'B)570', 'C)600', 'D)700', 'E)none of these']","Let the total number of students be 'x'.
Students who took only physics = 20% of x = 0.2x
Students who took only math = 28% of x = 0.28x

Since the number of students must be integers, 0.2x and 0.28x must be integers.  This means x must be a multiple of both 1/0.2 = 5 and 1/0.28 = 25/7. The least common multiple of 5 and 25/7 is found by multiplying 5 (which is 35/7) by 5, yielding 25. Hence, x must be a multiple of 25. Since x > 501, the smallest possible value for x is 525.
The question states that there are *more than* 501 students. So we have:
0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x students who took *only* math or *only* physics.  There could be students who took both, and the question doesn't specify anything about that.

If x = 525:
0.2 * 525 = 105
0.28 * 525 = 147
Total students taking *only* physics or *only* math = 252.

The question asks for the least possible number of students in the school. If we take the next multiple of 25 greater than 501, which is 525, the number of students taking only physics and only maths adds up to 252. Since there can be students who took both subjects, as well as students who took neither, the minimum number of students has to be 525 and not lesser. The options suggest answers much greater than 525, except for option A, 550. However, as shown above, 525 can be a valid number of students for the given criteria. Since the question specifies the lowest possible value, options greater than 525 are immediately ruled out.

Let's consider the case where x=550. Then:
Number of students taking only Physics = 0.2 * 550 = 110
Number of students taking only Maths = 0.28 * 550 = 154

This is valid since the question mentions that those are the percentages that take *exactly* physics and *exactly* maths respectively, meaning there can be students taking neither or both of those subjects.
Let us consider if 525 is a possible value:
Number of students taking only Physics = 0.2 * 525 = 105
Number of students taking only Maths = 0.28 * 525 = 147

This gives a total of 252 students.
Since we need the least possible number of students greater than 501, the answer should be 525. Among the options given, we can assume there might be some additional constraints not explicitly mentioned in the question, and thus, consider the closest option available.

# Answer option: ['A)51 days', 'B)61 days', 'C)71 days', 'D)81 days', 'E)91 days']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the area the cow can graze:** The cow's rope acts as the radius of a circle within which it can graze. The area of a circle is πr², where r is the radius. So, the grazable area is π * 14² ≈ 615.75 square feet.

2. **Calculate the time to graze the entire area:** The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day.  Therefore, it will take 615.75 sq.ft. / 10 sq.ft./day ≈ 61.58 days.

# Answer option: ['A)7', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)6']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Total Arrangements:**  If the chairs were distinct, there would be 3! = 6 ways to arrange the three children.  Since the chairs are identical, we must divide by the number of ways to arrange the chairs (which is also 3!) in the distinct chair case. However, there's a restriction which we should consider.
2. **The Restriction:** Susan must be to the left of Tim. This eliminates half of the possible arrangements where the chairs are distinct (because in the other half, Tim would be to the left of Susan).
3. **Possible Arrangements:** Let's list out the valid where the chairs are distinct:
    * Susan, Tim, Zen
    * Susan, Zen, Tim
    * Zen, Susan, Tim

Since the chairs are identical, arranging the children in these three orderings on the identical chairs is equivalent. Since Susan must be to the left of Tim, we divide the total number of arrangements (6) by 2 =3 to get 3.

We are given two scenarios:
1. 540 calls, bill is Rs. 1800: F + 540V = 1800
2. 620 calls, bill is Rs. 2040: F + 620V = 2040

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
80V = 240
V = 240/80
V = 3

Now, substitute V = 3 into the first equation:
F + 540(3) = 1800
F + 1620 = 1800

93,"A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?
# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)15', 'C)18', 'D)20', 'E)30']","Let H be the set of hardcover books, and F be the set of fiction books. We are given that |H| = 30 and |F| = 20. The total number of books is 45.  We want to find the maximum possible value of |H ∩ F| (the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction).

We know that |H ∪ F| = |H| + |F| - |H ∩ F|.  Since the total number of books is 45, the maximum value of |H ∪ F| is 45.

Therefore, 45 ≥ |H| + |F| - |H ∩ F|.
45 ≥ 30 + 20 - |H ∩ F|
45 ≥ 50 - |H ∩ F|
|H ∩ F| ≥ 50 - 45
|H ∩ F| ≥ 5

The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction occurs when the union of the two sets is minimized. In other words, we want to maximize the overlap. Since there are 20 fiction books, at most 20 books can be both hardcover and fiction. However, since there are 30 hardcover books, and only 45 books in total, there must be an overlap. Let x be the number of books that are both fiction and hardcover.
The number of books that are hardcover but not fiction is 30-x.
The number of books that are fiction but not hardcover is 20-x.
The number of books that are both is x.
The total number of books is (30-x) + (20-x) + x= 45.
50 - x = 45
x = 50-45 = 5.
So there must be at least 5 books that are both hardcover and fiction.
If we consider the smallest possible intersection between the two sets, then |H ∪ F| = 30 + 20 - |H ∩ F|. Since there are only 45 books, the maximum value for the union is 45.
Thus, 45 ≥ 50 - |H ∩ F|. This implies |H ∩ F| ≥ 5.

Also, |H ∩ F| cannot exceed the smaller of the two set sizes, which is |F| = 20.
So the maximum number of books that can be both is 20.
If 20 books are both, then there are 10 hardcover books that are not fiction and 0 fiction books that are not hardcover. This is a valid scenario. The total number of books is 20 + 10 + 0 = 30. There must be 15 additional books that are neither hardcover nor fiction. These books are only part of the total 45 books, so there must be some books that are both hardcover and fiction. Since the number of fiction books is 20, the maximum number of books that are both fiction and hardcover cannot exceed 20.

94,"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)30', 'C)45', 'D)60', 'E)75']","Let x be the number of newspapers ordered on Monday (and each of the other weekdays).
The hotel orders 2x newspapers on Sunday.

The cost of Sunday newspapers is $4 * 2x = $8x.
The cost of weekday newspapers is $1 * 6x = $6x (since there are 6 weekdays).

The total weekly cost is $8x + $6x = $14x.
We are given that the total weekly cost is $210, so we have the equation $14x = $210.
Dividing both sides by 14, we get x = 210 / 14 = 15.
The number of newspapers bought on Monday is x, which is 15.

95,"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)12', 'C)16', 'D)24', 'E)25']","Let 'x' be the original number of friends.
They planned to spend Rs. 96.
So, each friend would have contributed Rs. 96/x.
Four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who attended the picnic is (x - 4).
Now, each of them had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
So, each friend contributed (96/x + 4).
The total amount spent is still Rs. 96.
So, (x - 4) * (96/x + 4) = 96
96 + 4x - 384/x - 16 = 96
4x - 16 - 384/x = 0
4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0
x = 12 or x = -8
Since the number of friends cannot be negative, x = 12.
The number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.

# Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)11', 'C)22', 'D)25', 'E)31']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find the perimeter of the rectangle:** The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2 * (length + breadth). So, the perimeter of the given rectangle is 2 * (27 cm + 17 cm) = 2 * 44 cm = 88 cm.

2. **Relate the perimeter of the rectangle to the perimeter of the square:** When the wire is reshaped into a square, the total length of the wire remains the same. Therefore, the perimeter of the square is also 88 cm.

3. **Find the side of the square:** The perimeter of a square is 4 * side.  So, side = perimeter / 4 = 88 cm / 4 = 22 cm.

R/G = 3/4
R/120 = 3/4
To find R, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 120:
R = (3/4) * 120
R = 3 * 30
R = 90
So, there are 90 red sweets.

# Answer option: ['A)18', 'B)20', 'C)25', 'D)26', 'E)27']","Let 'n' be the number of members in the club.
The ages of the members are in Arithmetic Progression (AP) with a common difference of 3 months, which is 3/12 = 1/4 = 0.25 years.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The sum of the ages of all members is 250.

The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by:
S = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d]
where 'n' is the number of terms, 'a' is the first term, and 'd' is the common difference.

In this case, S = 250, a = 7, and d = 0.25.

250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]
500 = n * [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]
500 = n * [13.75 + 0.25n]
500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2
Multiplying by 4 to get rid of the decimal:
2000 = 55n + n^2
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula to solve for n:
n = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
n = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 - 4*1*(-2000))) / 2*1
n = (-55 ± sqrt(3025 + 8000)) / 2
n = (-55 ± sqrt(11025)) / 2
n = (-55 ± 105) / 2

We have two possible solutions for n:
n = (-55 + 105) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25
n = (-55 - 105) / 2 = -160 / 2 = -80

Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 25.

Profit = 20% of Cost price = 0.2 * 1200 = Rs. 240
Selling price = Cost price + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440
Now, we can equate the two expressions for selling price:

# Answer option: ['A)12 am on the next day', 'B)5 am on the next day', 'C)5 pm on the next day', 'D)2 pm on the next day', 'E)None of these']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the head start of Train A:** Train A has a 3-hour head start (from 11 am to 2 pm). In that time, it travels 3 hours * 40 kmph = 120 km.

2. **Determine the relative speed:** Since the trains are traveling in the same direction, the relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph. This means Train B is closing the distance between them at a rate of 32 km every hour.

3. **Calculate the time to meet:** Train B needs to cover the 120 km head start at a relative speed of 32 kmph.  Time = Distance / Speed = 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours, or 3 hours and 45 minutes.

4. **Determine the meeting time:** Train B left at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours and 45 minutes to 2 pm gives us 5:45 pm on the same day. Since none of the options include this time, the appropriate answer would be ""None of these"".

# Answer option: ['A)22', 'B)60', 'C)28', 'D)26', 'E)18']","Let 'x' be the amount Mark has and 'y' be the amount John has.

According to the first statement, Mark says if John gives him half his money, Mark will have Rs. 75.  This translates to:
x + y/2 = 75

According to the second statement, John says if Mark gives him one-third of his money, John will have Rs. 75. This translates to:
y + x/3 = 75

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) x + y/2 = 75
2) y + x/3 = 75

We can solve for x and y.  Multiply the first equation by 2:
2x + y = 150

Multiply the second equation by 3:
3y + x = 225

Now, we can solve for x in terms of y from the first equation:
y = 150 - 2x

Substitute this value of y into the second equation:
3(150 - 2x) + x = 225
450 - 6x + x = 225
450 - 5x = 225
225 = 5x
x = 45

Now substitute the value of x back into the equation y = 150 - 2x:
y = 150 - 2 * 45
y = 150 - 90
y = 60

So, John had Rs. 60.

# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)28', 'C)30', 'D)53', 'E)59']","Here's how to solve this:

* **Understanding the problem:** The lake doubles in lilies every two days.  If it takes 60 days to fill the lake from 1 lily, it takes 58 days to fill it from 2 lilies, 56 days from 4 lilies, and so on.  Each time the starting number of lilies doubles, the time to fill the lake reduces by two days.

* **Relating to 64 lilies:** 64 lilies is 2^6. This means the initial number of lilies has doubled six times (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).

* **Calculating the time reduction:** Since each doubling reduces the time by two days, six doublings reduce the time by 6 * 2 = 12 days.

* **Final calculation:** 60 days (original time) - 12 days (reduction) = 54 days.
However, since the doubling of lilies happens every two days, the reduction is equivalent to 6 doublings/3 doublings every two days. Therefore, the time reduced is 2*3=6 days. Hence, the total time is 60-6=54 days.

# Answer option: ['A)12', 'B)10', 'C)5', 'D)15', 'E)20']","The vertices of the quadrilaterals must be chosen from the six points A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Case 1:  The quadrilateral is formed using only the vertices of the pentagon (A, B, C, D, E). Since a regular pentagon has 5 vertices, and we need to choose 4 of them, we can do this in $\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = 5$ ways.

Case 2: The quadrilateral is formed using F and three vertices of the pentagon. We have 5 choices for the first vertex, 4 choices for the second vertex, and 3 choices for the third vertex. The order in which we choose the vertices doesn't matter, so we divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 vertices, which is $3! = 6$. Thus, there are $\frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 10$ such quadrilaterals.

Adding the number of quadrilaterals in each case, we have $5 + 10 = 15$ different quadrilaterals.

# Answer option: ['A)80°', 'B)130°', 'C)140°', 'D)160°', 'E)220°']","Here's how to solve this geometry problem:

1. **Arc AB:** Since B bisects minor arc AC, and arc AC is 160°, then arc AB = arc BC = 160°/2 = 80°.

2. **Arc CD:** We know the entire circle measures 360°.  We also know arc AB = 80°, arc BC = 80°, and arc BD = 150°.  So, arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc AD = 360°.  Therefore, arc CD + arc AD= 360° - (80° + 80° + 150°) = 50°.

3. **Arc AD:** We are given that arc BD = 150°. Arc BD is made up of arc BC and arc CD. Since arc BC is 80°, arc CD must be 150° - 80° = 70°.

   Now we can find arc AD. Arc CD + arc AD = 50°, and arc CD = 70°.  However, the arcs here are defined as *minor* arcs. Hence there's an inconsistency; CD cannot be 70 if BD is 150.

   The arc BD=150° is composed of arc BC=80° and arc CD. So, arc CD=150°-80°=70°. 
   Arc AC=160° is composed of arc AB=80° and arc BC=80°.
   The circle is 360°.
   The remaining arc, arc AD = 360° - (arc AB+arc BC+arc CD) = 360°-(80°+80°+70°)= 360°-230° = 130°.

    \item $|W^c \cap S^c| = 20\%$
\end{itemize}
We want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is $|S \cap W^c| = |S| - |S \cap W|$.

Since 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, 80% take either a winter or a summer vacation, or both.
$|W \cup S| = 100\% - |W^c \cap S^c| = 100\% - 20\% = 80\%$

We know that $|W \cup S| = |W| + |S| - |W \cap S|$.
So, $80\% = 75\% + |S| - 40\%$

# Answer option: ['A)70', 'B)30', 'C)3', 'D)7', 'E)5']","Let 'x' be the total number of matches played.
The team lost 30% of their matches, which means they won 100% - 30% = 70% of their matches.
They won 20 matches, so 70% of x = 20
0.7x = 20
x = 20 / 0.7
x ≈ 28.57
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 29.
The number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches, which is approximately:
0.3 * 29 ≈ 8.7 ≈ 9 matches or
Total number of matches= Won + lost
Lost matches= Total matches - Won Matches =28.57-20 = 8.57~9
Alternatively, we know that 70% of matches is 20, so 10% of matches is 20/7 ≈ 2.86.
30% of matches is then (20/7) * 3 = 60/7 ≈ 8.57 which can be rounded to 9
Since the team won 20 matches, this represents 70% of the total matches played.  Let 'x' be the total number of matches played.
0.70x = 20
x = 20 / 0.70
x ≈ 28.57
Total matches is approximately 29.
Lost matches = 0.30 * 29 ≈ 8.7 ≈ 9 matches.

1. **Simplify the expression for x:**
The given expression can be rewritten as:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
x= (n + 4√n + 4)(n+4√n+4-8√n+12)/(n+4√n+4)
Notice that the numerator is a perfect square: (√n(n+4) + 4)^2  = n(n+4)^2+8√n(n+4)+16
And the denominator is also a perfect square: (√n + 2)^2 = n + 4√n + 4

Therefore, x = (√n(n+4) + 4)^2/ (√n+2)^2= (√n(n+4)+4)^2/(√n+2)^2

x=(n+4)^2

2. **Find the range of x:**
We are given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72.  We want to find the range of x = (n+4)^2.

When n = 36, x = (36 + 4)^2 = 40^2 = 1600

C's share of the total profit is Rs. 150,000 out of Rs. 375,000. This can be simplified to 2/5.  Therefore, C's profit per month is (2/5) * (Total Profit) / (Number of months C invested). Let 'x' be the number of months C invested. So, C's profit per month = (150,000 / x).

**2. Calculate the profit ratios:**

A invested Rs. 40,000 for 12 months.
B invested Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (12 - 2).
C invested Rs. 120,000 for 'x' months.

The profit sharing ratio is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period of investment.  So, the ratios are:
A : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * x)
A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120000x
Simplifying by dividing by 120,000, we get:
A : B : C = 4 : 5 : 10x

**3. Relate the profit ratios to the profit distribution:**

We know that C's share of the profit is 150,000 out of 375,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit.
So, the total profit is divided in the ratio 4 : 5 : 10x, and C's share (10x) represents 2/5 of the total.

**4. Solve for x:**

Let the total profit be 'P'. Then C's share is (10x)/(4 + 5 + 10x) of P.

(10x) / (9+10x) = 2/5
Cross multiply:
50x=18+20x
30x=18
x=18/30
x=3/5 of a year 
x = (3/5)*12= 7.2 months since the start of the year.

So, C must have joined 7.2 - 2 = 5.2. Since C joined after B, we subtract 10 months from 7.2 months to get 7.2-10 = -2.8.

The ratio of profits is 
A:B:C = 48:60:12x=4:5:x
C gets 150,000 which is 2/5=0.4 of the profit of 375,000
C's share = x/(9+x) = 2/5
5x = 18 + 2x
3x = 18
x = 6.
Thus, C joined 6 months after the beginning of operations. 

Since A started, B joined after 2 months, C joined x months after B joined. 
Therefore C joined after 2+x months. Since C joined for 6 months, then 2+x+6=12 or x=4 months after B joined.

117,"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
# Answer option: ['A)8.75', 'B)8.79', 'C)8.75', 'D)8.71', 'E)8.72']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Area of the square:** The side of the square is 20 cm, so its area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 sq cm.

2. **Area of one semicircle:** The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm. The area of a full circle with this radius is π * (10 cm)^2 = 100π sq cm.  A semicircle has half this area: 100π sq cm / 2 = 50π sq cm.

3. **Area of two semicircles:** Since there are two semicircles, their combined area is 2 * 50π sq cm = 100π sq cm.

4. **Remaining area:** The remaining area of the square after the semicircles are cut out is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles: 400 sq cm - 100π sq cm.  Using the approximation π ≈ 3.14, the remaining area is approximately 400 sq cm - 100 * 3.14 sq cm = 400 sq cm - 314 sq cm = 86 sq cm.

# Answer option: ['A)277', 'B)288', 'C)200', 'D)277', 'E)168']","Let 'x' be the number of boys and girls that joined the group.
Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls.
After the new members joined, there are (64 + x) boys and (40 + x) girls.
The ratio of boys to girls is now 4:3.
So, (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3
Cross-multiply:
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
192 - 160 = 4x - 3x
32 = x

122,"Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
# Answer option: ['A)180', 'B)90', 'C)270', 'D)360', 'E)None of the above']","Let d be the distance between A and B.
Let t1 be the time taken to travel from A to B. Then t1 = d/70.
Let t2 be the time taken to travel from B to A. Then t2 = d/90.
The total time taken for the round trip is t1 + t2 = d/70 + d/90.

3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B and approaching B. This means he was on his way from A to B. So, he had traveled d - 70 miles at a speed of 70 mph.
The time taken to travel d - 70 miles is (d-70)/70.
The remaining time of the trip is 3 hours. The remaining distance is 70 miles to B and then d miles back to A.
So, 3 hours = remaining time = 70/70 + d/90 = 1 + d/90.
3 - 1 = d/90
2 = d/90
d = 2 * 90 = 180 miles.

The total time for the trip is t1 + t2 = 180/70 + 180/90 = 18/7 + 2 = 18/7 + 14/7 = 32/7 hours.
3 hours before the end of the trip, the elapsed time is (32/7) - 3 = (32 - 21)/7 = 11/7 hours.
At 70 mph, the distance covered in 11/7 hours is 70 * (11/7) = 110 miles.
Since the distance between A and B is 180 miles, after 110 miles, he is 180 - 110 = 70 miles away from B.

3x - 90 = x
3x - x = 90
2x = 90
x = 90/2
x = 45

Given that the man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water, so m = 4 kmph.
The rate against the current is given as 2 kmph, so m - c = 2 kmph.
Substituting m = 4 kmph, we get 4 - c = 2, which means c = 2 kmph.

# Answer option: ['A)368', 'B)377', 'C)288', 'D)997', 'E)112']","Let the three-digit number be represented as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are the digits. We are given the following information:

1. a + b + c = 17
2. a² + b² + c² = 109
3. 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a  => 99a - 99c = 495 => a - c = 5 => a = c + 5

Now we substitute a = c + 5 into the first equation:

(c + 5) + b + c = 17
2c + b = 12
b = 12 - 2c

Now substitute a = c + 5 and b = 12 - 2c into the second equation:

(c + 5)² + (12 - 2c)² + c² = 109
c² + 10c + 25 + 144 - 48c + 4c² + c² = 109
6c² - 38c + 169 = 109
6c² - 38c + 60 = 0
3c² - 19c + 30 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula or factoring:
(3c - 10)(c - 3) = 0

This gives us two possible values for c: c = 10/3 or c = 3. Since c must be an integer, c = 3.

Now we can find a and b:
a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8
b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 2(3) = 12 - 6 = 6

So the number is 863.  Now we check if our solution is correct:
1) 8 + 6 + 3 = 17
2) 8² + 6² + 3² = 64 + 36 + 9 = 109
3) 863 - 495 = 368

# Answer option: ['A)69:91', 'B)59:91', 'C)59:90', 'D)59:91', 'E)69:101']","Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9.  In 40 grams of alloy X:
Zinc = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
Copper = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams

Alloy Y has zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11. In 60 grams of alloy Y:
Zinc = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams
Copper = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams

Alloy Z is formed by mixing 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y.  Therefore, in alloy Z:
Zinc = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
Copper = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams
Total weight of alloy Z = 40 + 60 = 100 grams
In terms of percentages, this is about 39.33% and 60.67%.
The ratio of zinc to copper is approximately 39.33 : 60.67
To convert this to a simple whole number ratio, we can multiply both sides by 3. This gives approximately 118 : 182. Then we can divide by 2 to get 59 : 91.

# Answer option: ['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']","The median income is the middle value when the incomes are arranged in ascending order. Since the median income is $3000 and the total income is $9000, there must be at least three members in the family. If there are three members, their incomes could be arranged as x, 3000, y, where x+3000+y = 9000. If there are five members, the incomes could be like x, y, 3000, z, w. Since the median income is the middle value, there must be an odd number of family members.
We know the median income is $3000, meaning at least one person earns $3000. If there's only one person with this income, the total income wouldn't be $9000. So, there must be at least three people (two earning less than or equal to $3000 and two earning more than or equal to $3000), making $3000 the middle income.

# Answer option: ['A)80', 'B)120', 'C)240', 'D)320', 'E)360']","The store sold 80% of its 600 golf balls, which is 0.80 * 600 = 480 golf balls.  Since an equal number of yellow and white balls were sold, and all the white balls were sold, 480 / 2 = 240 white golf balls were sold (and thus 240 yellow golf balls were also sold). This means the store started with 240 white golf balls. Since the store started with 600 golf balls total, it must have started with 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

# Answer option: ['A)12 metre', 'B)12.5 metre', 'C)13.5 metre', 'D)14 metre', 'E)15 metre']","Let the height of the flagstaff be h1 and the length of its shadow be s1.
Let the height of the building be h2 and the length of its shadow be s2.
Given:
h1 = 17.5 m
s1 = 40.25 m
s2 = 28.75 m

We need to find h2.

Since the shadows are cast under similar conditions, the ratio of the height to the length of the shadow will be the same for both the flagstaff and the building.
Therefore,
h1/s1 = h2/s2

17.5 / 40.25 = h2 / 28.75
h2 = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25
h2 = 503.125 / 40.25

# Answer option: ['A)3 hours', 'B)5 hours', 'C)6 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)7 hours']","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the difference in speed:**

The first car is traveling 55 mph, and the second is traveling 52 mph.  The difference in their speeds is 55 - 52 = 3 mph.

**2. Calculate the time to separate by 15 miles:**

Since the first car is 3 mph faster, it gains 3 miles of distance on the second car every hour. To gain a 15-mile separation, it will take 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.

143,"The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
# Answer option: ['A)0.5', 'B)0.6', 'C)0.7', 'D)0.8', 'E)0.9']","Here's how to solve this probability problem:

**Understanding Independent Events**

Independent events mean the outcome of one event doesn't affect the outcome of the other.  The formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring is:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)


**Setting up the Equation**

We are given:
* P(A) = 0.6
* P(A or B) = 0.96

We want to find P(B).  Let's substitute the known values into the formula:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))


**Solving for P(B)**

1. Simplify the equation:
   0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)

2. Subtract 0.6 from both sides:
   0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)

3. Divide both sides by 0.4:
   P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4

# Answer option: ['A)1 hr 23 min', 'B)1 hr 15 min', 'C)1 hr 8 min', 'D)56 min', 'E)55 min']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the duration of each train's journey:**
   * Train M: 9 am - 5 am = 4 hours
   * Train N: 10:30 am - 7 am = 3.5 hours (3 hours 30 minutes)

2. **Let the distance between City A and City B be 'D'.**

3. **Calculate the speed of each train:**
   * Train M's speed: D / 4
   * Train N's speed: D / 3.5

4. **Determine the time until the trains meet:**
   * Train M starts at 5 am, Train N starts at 7 am.
   * By 7 am, Train M has already traveled for 2 hours. The distance covered by M = (D/4) * 2 = D/2
   * The remaining distance between the two trains is D - D/2 = D/2
   * The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds: (D/4) + (D/3.5) = 7D/14 + 4D/14=11D/28
   * Time taken for the trains to meet: (Remaining distance) / (Relative speed) = (D/2) / (11D/28)= (D/2) * (28/11D) = 14/11 hours
   * Convert 14/11 hours to hours and minutes: 14/11 = 1 and 3/11 hours, 3/11 hour equals to 3*60/11= 180/11 minutes = 16.36 minutes
* Total time would be 1 hour 16.36 minutes ~ 1 hr 16 min.
**
Since train M has been running for 2 hours before N departs, we subtract that from the result.

5. **Calculate the final meeting time:**
   * Train M departs at 5 am. 5 am + 14/11 hours is 5 am plus approximately 1 hour and 16.4 minutes which is 6:16 am.

# Answer option: ['A)6', 'B)8', 'C)10', 'D)12', 'E)14']","For 8 people, Jill bought 10 bottles of soda. This means she bought 10/8 = 1.25 bottles per person.
If 12 people are attending the party, she will need to buy 1.25 * 12 = 15 bottles of soda. However, 15 is not an option. Assuming the rate of consumption is constant and there needs to be enough for everyone, if 10 sodas are needed for 8 people, then proportionally more will be needed for 12. Let's set up a proportion:
10 bottles / 8 people = x bottles / 12 people
Cross-multiply:
8x = 120
x = 120 / 8
x = 15 bottles.  Since 15 isn't an option, the closest option that ensures enough soda is the next highest number available.

# Answer option: ['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']","Here's how to solve this problem:

Let the height of the room be 'h' meters and the semi-perimeter of the floor be 's' meters.
Given that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5, we have:
h/s = 2/5  => s = 5h/2

The area of the four walls is given by 2h(l+b) where l and b are the length and breadth of the room.  Since the semi-perimeter is (l+b), we can rewrite the area of the walls as 2hs = 2h * (5h/2) = 5h^2.

The area to be papered is the total area of the walls minus the area of doors and windows. This is equal to 5h^2 - 15 sq.m.

The cost of papering is Rs.260 at Rs.2 per meter. This means the length of the paper used is 260/2 = 130 meters.
Since the paper is 50cm (0.5m) wide, the area of the paper used is 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.

Therefore, the area of the walls to be papered is equal to the area of the paper used:
5h^2 - 15 = 65
5h^2 = 80
h^2 = 16
h = 4 meters

# Answer option: ['A)40', 'B)62', 'C)82', 'D)92', 'E)102']","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Find the greatest integer:** Since the integers are consecutive and the smallest is -50, we can find the largest integer by adding (k-1) to the smallest. So, the largest integer is -50 + (k-1).

2. **Use the sum formula:** The sum of consecutive integers from 'a' to 'b' is given by [(a+b)/2] * (number of terms). In our case, a = -50, b = -50 + (k-1), and the number of terms is k. The sum is given as 51.

3. **Set up the equation:**  [(-50 + (-50 + k - 1))/2] * k = 51

Anna could originally buy 300/x articles.
The price decreased by 15%, so the new price is x - 0.15x = 0.85x.
Anna can now buy 300 / 0.85x articles.
We are given that she can buy 5 more articles, so:
300 / 0.85x = 300/x + 5
Multiply both sides by x:
300 / 0.85 = 300 + 5x
300 / 0.85 - 300 = 5x
(300 - 300*0.85) / 0.85 = 5x
(300 - 255) / 0.85 = 5x
45 / 0.85 = 5x
45 / (5*0.85) = x
9 / 0.85 = x
The new price is 0.85x. So, new price = 0.85 * (9/0.85) = $9
However, we are given that she bought 5 more articles, thus the difference in number of articles is: 300/0.85x-300/x=5
Multiplying both sides by 0.85x we get
300-0.85*300=5*0.85x
300-255=4.25x
45=4.25x
x = 45/4.25≈ 10.59 is the old price
New price = 0.85x=0.85*10.59≈$9 (A, slightly off due to rounding)

Now, we are given that she can now buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. Let the original price be P. So originally she could buy 300/P articles. Now, the price is 0.85P and she can buy 300/0.85P articles.  
We are given 300/0.85P - 300/P = 5
Multiplying by P we get
300/0.85 - 300 = 5P
352.94 - 300 = 5P

# Answer option: ['A)58.3%', 'B)62.5%', 'C)63.5%', 'D)64.5%', 'E)65.5%']","Let the man's initial income be 'I'.
He spends 70% of his income, which is 0.70 * I.

His income increases by 20%, so his new income is I + 0.20 * I = 1.20 * I.
His expenditure also increases. We assume he maintains the same spending habit, which is 70% of his new income.
New expenditure = 70% of (1.20 * I) = 0.70 * 1.20 * I = 0.84 * I.

To find the percentage increase in his expenditure:
Percentage increase = [(New expenditure - Old expenditure) / Old expenditure] * 100
= [(0.84 * I - 0.70 * I) / (0.70 * I)] * 100
= [(0.14 * I) / (0.70 * I)] * 100
= (0.14 / 0.70) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

His new expenditure is 20% more than his original expenditure. Original expenditure was 70% of his income. New expenditure as a percentage of his original income is 0.84, which means 84% of his original income.
However, the question asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of his *new* income.

New expenditure = 0.70 * (1.20 * I) = 0.84 * I
New income = 1.20 * I
New expenditure as a percentage of new income = (0.84 * I) / (1.20 * I) * 100
= (0.84 / 1.20) * 100
= 0.7 * 100
= 70%

The man still spends 70% of his income.  None of the answer choices are 70%. There seems to be some confusion with the question. We have the new income as 1.20 * I. He spends 70% of this, which is 0.7 * 1.2 * I = 0.84 I. The questions seems to be asking what percentage of the *new* income this 0.84 I represents. 0.84/1.2 = 0.7 = 70%.

# Answer option: ['A)1 hour', 'B)2 hours', 'C)3 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)5 hours']","Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C.
Sharon earns C/5 per hour.
Karen earns C/4 per hour.
Working together, they earn (C/5) + (C/4) = (4C + 5C) / 20 = 9C/20 per hour.
The time it takes them to earn C together is C / (9C/20) = 20/9 hours. This is approximately 2.22 hours.
Since they need to work a whole number of hours to buy the cake, they'll need to work for 3 hours.

So the time required to buy the ice cream cake is 20/9 which is approximately 2.22 hours.

165,"If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true?
# Answer option: ['A)x > y', 'B)y^2 > x^2', 'C)-x^3 < y^2', 'D)–x < y', 'E)x < –y']","Since x < 0 and y > 0, we have x^3 < 0 and y^2 > 0.  Since |x^3| > |y^2|, we have -x^3 > y^2.  Multiplying by -1 gives x^3 < -y^2.  Since y > 0, we have -y < 0. Since x < 0 and -y < 0, comparing x and -y involves comparing their cubes: x^3 and -y^3.  Since x^3 < -y^2, and -y^2 < -y^3 (since -y < 0 and hence 1 < y), it may not be true that x^3 < -y^3 or that x < -y.  However, we are given that -x^3 > y^2. This is equivalent to -x^3 > y^2.
Consider x = -2 and y = 1. |x^3| = |-8| = 8, |y^2| = |1| = 1. So |x^3| > |y^2|. Also x < -y, so x < -y is a possible solution.
Consider x=-2, y=3, |x^3|=|-8|=8, |y^2|=9, |x^3| < |y^2|, so this is not a valid test case.

If we consider -x^3 > y^2, x < 0 and y > 0, then we can take the cube root of both sides:
-x > y^(2/3)
Multiply by -1:
x < -y^(2/3)
Since y>0, y^(2/3) is positive. Thus -y^(2/3) is negative.
Since y>0, y^(2/3) < y.  Multiplying by -1 gives -y^(2/3) > -y.
Since x < -y^(2/3), x < -y^(2/3). Since -y^(2/3)>-y, x < -y.

# Answer option: ['A)45', 'B)48', 'C)51', 'D)54', 'E)57']","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Combined Speed:** The ants are moving towards each other, so their speeds add up. The combined speed is 9 cm/hr + 6 cm/hr = 15 cm/hr.

2. **Time to Meet:**  The distance between the farms is 75 cm. To find the time it takes for them to meet, divide the distance by their combined speed: 75 cm / 15 cm/hr = 5 hours.

3. **Distance Traveled by Ant A:** Now, multiply Ant A's speed by the time it took them to meet: 9 cm/hr * 5 hours = 45 cm.

# Answer option: ['A)9 Trousers', 'B)8 Trousers', 'C)10 Trousers', 'D)7 Trousers', 'E)11 Trousers']","Let 't' be the number of trousers and 's' be the number of shirts.
The total cost is given by the equation: 70t + 30s = 810.
We want to maximize the number of trousers (t) purchased.

We can simplify the equation by dividing by 10:
7t + 3s = 81

Now we can express s in terms of t:
3s = 81 - 7t
s = (81 - 7t) / 3

Since 's' must be a non-negative integer, (81 - 7t) must be divisible by 3.  We can test values of t:
If t = 9, s = (81 - 63) / 3 = 18/3 = 6
If t = 10, s = (81-70)/3 = 11/3 which is not an integer
If t=11, s=(81-77)/3 = 4/3 which is not an integer

Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be bought is 9, with 6 shirts.

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)23', 'C)16', 'D)18', 'E)12']","Let 'h' be the number of times the coin landed on Heads and 't' be the number of times the coin landed on Tails.
We are given that a coin is flipped 20 times, so h + t = 20.
When the coin lands on Heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. When the coin lands on Tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. Since neither of them won or lost any money, the total amount exchanged must be equal.
So, 2h (amount Christopher gave) = 3t (amount Jonathan gave).
We have two equations:
1) h + t = 20
2) 2h = 3t

From equation (1), we can express t in terms of h: t = 20 - h
Substitute this value of t into equation (2):
2h = 3(20 - h)
2h = 60 - 3h
5h = 60
h = 12

Now, substitute h = 12 back into the equation t = 20 - h:
t = 20 - 12
t = 8

The coin landed on Heads 12 times.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
# Answer option: ['A)144km', 'B)72 km', 'C)126km', 'D)84 km', 'E)48km']","Let the distance between X and Y be 'd'.
Let the distance covered by Allen when they meet for the first time be 'a'.
Then the distance covered by Bob when they meet for the first time will be 'd - a'.
Since they start at the same time, the time taken for both will be the same.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Allen = a / 54
Time taken by Bob = (d - a) / 78
Equating the time:
a / 54 = (d - a) / 78
78a = 54d - 54a
132a = 54d
a = (54/132)d
a = (9/22)d

When they meet for the second time, let the distance covered by Allen be a'.
Distance covered by Bob will be d + d-a + x = 2d - a + x
Total distance covered by Allen when they meet for the second time will be a + x + d - a = a + d - a + d-a = d + x
where x is a part of the return journey.
Total distance covered by Allen = d + d - a = 2d - a = 2d - (9/22)d = (44d-9d)/22 = 35d/22
Total distance covered by Bob = d+a'+d-(d-a) = a'+d+a = d + a'+ a = d + d+x
Total distance covered by Bob = 3d
Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time.
3d - (2d-a+x) = 48
Total distance covered by Bob = d + d+ d-a-x
Total distance covered by Allen = 2d
3d - 2d = 48
d = 48


Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.
Let the distance covered by Allen be A and by Bob be B.
B = A + 48
When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both is 3d.
A + B = 3d
A + A + 48 = 3d
2A + 48 = 3d

Let Allen cover x when they meet the first time.
x/54 = (d-x)/78
78x = 54d - 54x
132x = 54d
x = (54/132)d = (9/22)d

Total distance covered by Allen = d + (d-x) = 2d - x
Total distance covered by Bob = d + d+x = 2d + x
2d + x - (2d - x) = 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Distance between X and Y = d.
Allen covers a when they meet the first time. Bob covers d-a.
a/54 = (d-a)/78
78a = 54d - 54a
132a = 54d
a = (9/22)d

When they meet the second time,
Allen covers d+ (d-(9/22)d) = d + 13d/22 = 35d/22
Bob covers d + d + (9/22)d = 51d/22

Difference = (51d/22) - (35d/22) = 16d/22
16d/22 = 48
d = (48*22)/16 = 66

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
# Answer option: ['A)8%', 'B)10%', 'C)12.5%', 'D)16.7%', 'E)25%']","The cost of new tires is $180 per tire, and they last for 4 years. So the average cost per year for new tires is $180 / 4 = $45.
The cost of repairing the tires is $40 per tire, and this repair makes them last for one additional year. So the average cost per year for repaired tires is $40 / 1 = $40.
The difference in average cost per year is $45 - $40 = $5.

# Answer option: ['A)9 2 0 0', 'B)9 2 0 9', 'C)9 2 0 1', 'D)9 2 0 7', 'E)9 2 2 2']","Here's how we can solve this cryptarithmetic puzzle:

1. **D * E = E:**  The only way a single-digit multiplication results in the same digit is if E is either 0 or 5. If E were 0, the entire bottom row would be zeros, which doesn't match. Therefore, E must be 5.

2. **D * D = D (units digit):**  With E=5, we know D*D must end in either a 5 or a 0. The only digit where squaring itself will end in a 5 is 5. So, D=5

3. **D * M + carry = A (tens digit of MAD) / D * B + carry = R / D*M + carry = A**:
Since D*D (units digit), has a carry-over of 2. D*M + 2 must end in A and D*B + carry must end in R.
MAD * B = RAE.
MAD * M = AMID

However, from step 1, and 2, E=D=5. This is a contradiction. Let's revisit assuming E=0 instead.

If E=0, then D cannot be zero since D * M + carry = A and D * B + carry = R. Then from the MAD * E part, we'll have MAD * 0 = 000, hence A=E=0, which is also a contracdiction. It should also imply that the tens and unit digits of the product D*D results in D. That would give two solutions: 
5*5 = 25  and  6*6 = 36
So D could be 5 or 6.
Assuming D=6, then E must be 6 or 1 (since E*E = E - this would lead to a contradiction since D cannot equal E).
Assuming D=5 and E=0, we have:
M A 5
B 0
-----
0 0 0
R A 0
-------
A M I 5

From this, D=5 and E=0.  Since D * M results in A as last digit, we have 5* M + carry. If we consider 5 * 1= 5 and 5*3 =15, 5*7 = 35, 5 * 9 =45, so possible values for A are 5. Since A*5+ carry would need to end in 0, and no multiple of 5 + any carry would result in 0 again.
Let's consider another scenario. Let D = 6, E = 5.
Then, D*E = 30. So, the last digit matches. D * D = 36, last digit matches.

Consider another scenario:
D=5, E=0.  Then M and B are arbitrary and R = 0. I = 0. However, MAD* M = AMID means A=M which is not possible.
We know 5 * M should give A, and 5* B should give R. 5* M again give us A and 5*A gives us 0 or 5.

If D = 6. Since D*D should have D in the last digit, D can only be 5. So let D=5.
Then MAD*5 ends in 5. So E=5 or 0.

If E=0. Then M, A, B, R, I could be 925, 3, 4. Then we have
925
30
---
000
460
---
2775
So one possibility is 925, 30, 000, 460, 2775

If E=0. Then D=5. Then we must have 5*5 end in 5, so 25, remainder 2.
Then 5*M should give A. A*5 gives 0.

Consider M=9, A=2, D=0

# Answer option: ['A)43 seconds', 'B)39 seconds', 'C)20 seconds', 'D)33 seconds', 'E)55 seconds']","The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
The tunnel is 1 mile long.
The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel completely.

First, we need to find the length of the train. Since the train travels at 120 mph, we can convert this speed to miles per second:
120 miles/hour * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 1/30 miles/second

Since it takes 3 seconds for the train to fully enter the tunnel, the length of the train is:
(1/30 miles/second) * 3 seconds = 1/10 mile

The total distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel is the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train:
1 mile + 1/10 mile = 11/10 miles = 1.1 miles

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to travel this distance at 120 mph. First, convert the speed to miles per second:
120 miles/hour * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 1/30 miles/second

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = (11/10 miles) / (1/30 miles/second)
Time = (11/10) * 30 seconds
Time = 33 seconds

187,"A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount?
# Answer option: ['A)247.67', 'B)237.67', 'C)227.67', 'D)215.67', 'E)None of these']","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the discount:**

* The terms 4/30 mean a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days.
* Discount amount = 0.04 * $20,000 = $800

**2. Calculate the amount payable within the discount period:**

* Amount payable = $20,000 - $800 = $19,200

**3. Calculate the number of days of credit available if the discount is not taken:**

* The terms n/100 mean the net amount is due within 100 days.
* Days of credit without discount = 100 days - 30 days = 70 days

**4. Calculate the amount of interest that could be paid:**

* The amount of interest that could be paid is equal to the discount amount: $800

**5. Calculate the highest simple interest rate:**

* Simple interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
* Rearranging the formula to solve for Rate: Rate = (Simple interest * 100) / (Principal * Time)
* Rate = ($800 * 100) / ($19,200 * 70/365) 
* Rate = 80,000 / (1344000/365)
* Rate ≈ 80,000 / 3682.19
* Rate ≈ 21.73% which can be rounded up to 21.73 %

So, the merchant can afford to borrow money at a rate slightly below 21.73% to take advantage of the discount.

188,"There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups?
# Answer option: ['A)90', 'B)105', 'C)126', 'D)252', 'E)525']","We have 10 people and want to divide them into two groups of 5.  This is a combination problem.

First, we choose 5 people out of 10 for the first group. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!) = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 252

Once we've chosen the first group of 5, the remaining 5 people automatically form the second group. So there's only 1 way to choose the second group after the first group has been chosen.

Therefore, there are 252 ways to divide the 10 people into two groups of 5.

# Answer option: ['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']","Let 's' be the cost of one soda and 'b' be the cost of one energy bar.
We are given two equations:
1) s + 2b = 150
2) 2s + 3b = 300

Multiply the first equation by 2:
2s + 4b = 300

Now we have:
2s + 3b = 300
2s + 4b = 300

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
b = 0

Substitute b = 0 into the first equation:
s + 2(0) = 150

191,"A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?
# Answer option: ['A)Rs. 6', 'B)Rs. 7.2', 'C)Rs. 5.6', 'D)Rs. 8', 'E)None of these']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the number of pens to be manufactured:** Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company needs to produce more than 7200 pens. Let 'x' be the total number of pens manufactured.  Then 90% of x is equal to 7200. So, 0.9x = 7200, which means x = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:** The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, so the total revenue is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72000.

3. **Calculate the total cost:** The profit is 25% of the total cost.  Let 'C' be the total cost. Then the profit is 0.25C.  The total revenue is the sum of the total cost and the profit, so 72000 = C + 0.25C, which simplifies to 72000 = 1.25C.  Therefore, C = 72000 / 1.25 = Rs. 57600.

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:** The total cost is Rs. 57600, and the company manufactures 8000 pens. So, the cost per pen is 57600 / 8000 = Rs. 7.2.

9x = 18
x = 2

We are also given that the unit's place digit is double the ten's place digit. So,

# Answer option: ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']","Let $x = a + \alpha$ and $y = b + \beta$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $0 \le \alpha, \beta < 1$.
$L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = a + b + [a + b + \alpha + \beta]$
$R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = [2a + 2\alpha] + [2b + 2\beta]$

Case 1: $0 \le \alpha, \beta < 0.5$. Then $\alpha + \beta < 1$, so
$L(x,y) = a + b + a + b = 2a + 2b$
$R(x,y) = 2a + 2b$
So $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$.

Case 2: $0.5 \le \alpha, \beta < 1$. Then $1 \le \alpha + \beta < 2$, so
$L(x,y) = a + b + a + b + 1 = 2a + 2b + 1$
$R(x,y) = 2a + 1 + 2b + 1 = 2a + 2b + 2$
So $L(x,y) < R(x,y)$.

Case 3: $0 \le \alpha < 0.5$ and $0.5 \le \beta < 1$. Then $0.5 \le \alpha + \beta < 1.5$
Subcase 3.1: $0.5 \le \alpha + \beta < 1$. Then
$L(x,y) = a + b + a + b = 2a + 2b$
$R(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 1$

Subcase 3.2: $1 \le \alpha + \beta < 1.5$. Then
$L(x,y) = a + b + a + b + 1 = 2a + 2b + 1$
$R(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 1$
So $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$.

Thus, $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$ is possible, and $L(x,y) \neq R(x,y)$ is possible.
Also, $L(x,y) < R(x,y)$ is possible.
$L(x,y) > R(x,y)$ is never possible.
It is impossible to have $L(x,y) > R(x,y)$.

# Answer option: ['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']","To find when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48.
First, find the prime factorization of each number:
36 = 2^2 * 3^2
40 = 2^3 * 5
48 = 2^4 * 3

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in the numbers:
LCM(36, 40, 48) = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 720

The LCM is 720 seconds. To convert to minutes, divide by 60:

Let the height of the tree be h2 and the length of its shadow be s2.
Given:
h1 = 14 metres
s1 = 10 metres
s2 = 15 metres
We need to find h2.
Since the shadows are cast under similar conditions, the ratio of the height to the length of the shadow will be the same for both the pole and the tree.
Therefore, h1/s1 = h2/s2
14/10 = h2/15
h2 = (14 * 15) / 10
h2 = 210 / 10
h2 = 21 metres
So, the height of the tree is 21 metres.

* **Orange:** 18 dollars (1+8 = 9; 9 * 2 = 18)
* **Pineapple:** 27 dollars (2+7 = 9; 9 * 3 = 27)
* **Grape:** 15 dollars (1+5 = 6; 6 * 2.5= 15)
* **Mango:**  Let's represent Mango by AB where A and B are digits
The prices seem to be derived from the sum of the digits multiplied by a factor. We are assuming this holds true for Mango.
Let the factor for Mango be F.
Sum of digits = A+B. Then,
(A+B)*F = price where price is represented by 10*A+B, so (A+B)*F=10*A+B.
There is only one combination possible for Mango of 2 digits AB (A, B non-zero single digits) to satisfy the above equation: 18 (1+8 = 9, 18 = 9 * 2).

And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
# Answer option: ['A)1/18', 'B)1/9', 'C)23/90', 'D)5/18', 'E)13/45']","The question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly *but not by cheating*.  This means either Alan or Peter must get the correct answer.

Alan's probability of being correct is 1/5.
Peter's probability of being correct is 5/6.
Roger cheated, so we ignore his probability.

Since Alan and Peter are independent events, we can add their probabilities to find the probability that at least one of them answers correctly:
(1/5) + (5/6)
= (6/30) + (25/30)
= 31/30

However, this probability includes the cases where *both* Alan and Peter are correct. Since we're dealing with probabilities, the maximum possible value is 1 (or 100%). A value greater than 1 means we've overcounted.

We need to find the probability that either Alan is right OR Peter is right, but NOT BOTH.
P(Alan correct) = 1/5
P(Peter correct) = 5/6

P(Alan correct AND Peter correct) = (1/5) * (5/6) = 5/30 = 1/6
P(Alan correct OR Peter correct) = P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Both correct) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/6) = 6/30 + 25/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15

We initially calculate the probability of either Alan or Peter (or both) getting the correct answer. Then, we subtract the probability that they both get it right, which gives us the probability that only one of them gets it right.
P(Alan right) = 1/5
P(Peter right) = 5/6
P(Alan right and Peter right) = (1/5) * (5/6) = 1/6
P(either Alan or Peter right, not both) = P(Alan right) + P(Peter right) - 2*P(Alan right and Peter right) = (1/5) + (5/6) - 2(1/6) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/3) = 6/30 + 25/30 - 10/30 = 21/30 = 7/10

OR, we can do:
P(Alan right and Peter wrong) = (1/5)*(1/6) = 1/30
P(Alan wrong and Peter right) = (4/5)*(5/6) = 2/3 = 20/30
P(only one right) = 1/30 + 20/30 = 21/30 = 7/10

However, 7/10 is not an option. We want the probability that either Alan or Peter answer correctly. 
P(Alan correct) = 1/5
P(Peter correct) = 5/6
P(Alan OR Peter correct) = P(Alan correct) + P(Peter correct) - P(Alan AND Peter Correct)
= (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6) = (6/30) + (25/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 = 13/15

# Answer option: ['A)10%', 'B)12%', 'C)6%', 'D)8%', 'E)4%']","Here's how to solve this:

**Understanding the Difference**

The difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) over two years is due to the interest earned on the interest in the second year for CI.

**Formula**

The difference between CI and SI over two years is given by:

Difference = P * (R/100)² 

Where:
* P = Principal
* R = Rate of interest

**Calculation**

1. We know the difference is Rs. 72 and the principal is Rs. 5000.  Let's plug these values into the formula:

   72 = 5000 * (R/100)²

2. Simplify the equation:

   72/5000 = (R/100)²

   0.0144 = (R/100)²

3. Take the square root of both sides:

   √0.0144 = R/100

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)70', 'C)75', 'D)100', 'E)125']","Let V be the set of files infected by a virus, and W be the set of files infected by a worm.
We are given that there are 250 files in total.
Let x be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, i.e., |V ∩ W| = x.
The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both, so |W - V| = 2.5x.
We are given that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means 50% of the files were infected by a virus, so |V| = 0.5 * 250 = 125.
Since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, we have |V ∪ W| = 250.
We know that |V ∪ W| = |V| + |W| - |V ∩ W|.
We also know that |W| = |W - V| + |V ∩ W|, so |W| = 2.5x + x = 3.5x.
Therefore, 250 = 125 + 3.5x - x, which simplifies to 250 = 125 + 2.5x.
Subtracting 125 from both sides, we get 125 = 2.5x.
Dividing by 2.5, we find x = 125 / 2.5 = 50.
So, the number of files infected by both is x = 50.
The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x = 2.5 * 50 = 125.
The number of files infected by a worm is |W| = 3.5x = 3.5 * 50 = 175.
The number of files infected by a virus is |V| = 125.
The number of files NOT infected by a worm is 250 - |W| = 250 - 175 = 75.

# Answer option: ['A)2400', 'B)2500', 'C)2600', 'D)2700', 'E)None of these']","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the time each son's investment will grow:**

* Mohan will invest his money for 26 - 23 = 3 years.
* Sohan will invest his money for 26 - 24 = 2 years.

**2.  Set up the equation:**

Let 'm' be Mohan's share and 's' be Sohan's share.  We know that m + s = 5100.  We also know that their investments will be equal at age 26.  The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case, n = 1 (compounded annually).  So, the equation becomes:

m(1 + 0.04)^3 = s(1 + 0.04)^2

m(1.04)^3 = s(1.04)^2

m(1.124864) = s(1.0816)

**3. Solve for Mohan's share (m):**

Since s = 5100 - m, substitute this into the equation:

m(1.124864) = (5100 - m)(1.0816)

1.124864m = 5510.16 - 1.0816m

2.206464m = 5510.16

m = 5510.16 / 2.206464

m ≈ 2498.24 , which is approximately 2500.

# Answer option: ['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']","Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find the volume of the original coin:** The coin is a cylinder.  The volume of a cylinder is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (thickness). The radius is half the diameter (15mm / 2 = 7.5mm). So the volume is π * (7.5mm)² * 2mm ≈ 353.43 mm³.

2. **Find the volume of each metal in the original coin:** Since the volumes of aluminum and silver are equal, each metal occupies half the total volume.  So each metal's volume is 353.43 mm³ / 2 ≈ 176.71 mm³.

3. **Determine the relative weights of aluminum and silver:** Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.  Since the volumes are equal, the silver portion of the original coin contributes twice as much to the weight as the aluminum portion. Let 'x' be the weight of the aluminum. Then the weight of silver is 2x. The total weight is x + 2x = 30 grams.  Therefore, x = 10 grams (aluminum) and 2x = 20 grams (silver).

4. **Calculate the weight of 1 mm³ of aluminum:**  The aluminum in the original coin weighs 10 grams and has a volume of 176.71 mm³.  Therefore, the weight of 1 mm³ of aluminum is 10 grams / 176.71 mm³ ≈ 0.0566 grams/mm³.

5. **Find the volume of the new coin:** The new coin has dimensions 1 mm x 30 mm. Its volume is π * (15mm)² * 1mm ≈ 706.86 mm³.

6. **Calculate the weight of the new coin:** The new coin is made of pure aluminum.  Its volume is 706.86 mm³, and the weight of 1 mm³ of aluminum is 0.0566 grams/mm³.  Therefore, the weight of the new coin is 706.86 mm³ * 0.0566 grams/mm³ ≈ 40 grams.

206,"If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number
# Answer option: ['A)100', 'B)160', 'C)150', 'D)210', 'E)220']","Let the number be x.
2/3 of the number is (2/3)x.
10 subtracted from 2/3 of the number is (2/3)x - 10.
1/3 of the number is (1/3)x.
The sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number is 40 + (1/3)x.

According to the problem, we have the equation:
(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

Subtract (1/3)x from both sides:
(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40
(1/3)x - 10 = 40

Add 10 to both sides:
(1/3)x = 40 + 10
(1/3)x = 50

Multiply both sides by 3:
x = 50 * 3
x = 150

207,"What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots?
# Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)7', 'C)3', 'D)8', 'E)12']","Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Discriminant:**

For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant (Δ) determines the nature of the roots:

* Δ > 0: Two distinct real roots.
* Δ = 0: One real root (or two identical real roots).
* Δ < 0: Two complex roots.

The discriminant is calculated as Δ = b² - 4ac.

**Applying to the Given Equation:**

In our equation, x² - 5x + k = 0, we have a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. We want two distinct real roots, so we need Δ > 0.

Substituting the values, we get:

Δ = (-5)² - 4 * 1 * k > 0
25 - 4k > 0
25 > 4k
k < 25/4
k < 6.25

**Finding the Largest Integer:**

Since we're looking for the largest *integral* value of k, and k must be less than 6.25, the largest integer that satisfies this condition is 6.

# Answer option: ['A)9 hours.', 'B)10 hours.', 'C)11 hours.', 'D)12 hours.', 'E)13 hours.']","Shweta covers 15 km in 15/10 = 1.5 hours.
She takes a rest of 10 minutes = 10/60 = 1/6 hours.
So, to cover 15 km, she takes 1.5 + 1/6 = 9/6 + 1/6 = 10/6 = 5/3 hours.
She has to cover 100 km.
Number of 15 km stretches in 100 km = 100/15 = 6 + 10/15 = 6 + 2/3.
So, there are 6 stretches of 15 km each and a remaining 10 km stretch.
Time taken to cover 6 stretches of 15 km = 6 * 5/3 = 10 hours.
Remaining distance = 100 - (6*15) = 100 - 90 = 10 km.
Time taken to cover 10 km = 10/10 = 1 hour.
Total time taken = 10 + 1 = 11 hours.

# Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)25%', 'C)30%', 'D)35%', 'E)40%']","Here's how to solve this problem:

* **8:00 am:** The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 remaining.
* **9:00 am:** The dog eats 1/3 * (2/3) = 2/9 of the original food, leaving (2/3) - (2/9) = 4/9 remaining.
* **10:00 am:** The dog eats 1/3 * (4/9) = 4/27 of the original food, leaving (4/9) - (4/27) = 8/27 remaining.
* **11:00 am:** The dog eats 1/3 * (8/27) = 8/81 of the original food, leaving (8/27) - (8/81) = 16/81 remaining.

So, right before noon, there is 16/81 of the original food left.  To express this as a percentage, we calculate (16/81) * 100 ≈ 19.75%, which is approximately 20%.

# Answer option: ['A)88', 'B)89', 'C)90', 'D)91', 'E)92']","Let $S_n$ be the number of ways to reach the top of stairs with $n$ steps.
If there is only 1 step, there is only 1 way to reach the top: $S_1 = 1$.
If there are 2 steps, there are 2 ways: take 1 step twice, or take 2 steps once. $S_2 = 2$.
If there are $n$ steps, the last step taken can be either 1 step or 2 steps.
If the last step is 1 step, there are $S_{n-1}$ ways to reach the $(n-1)$-th step.
If the last step is 2 steps, there are $S_{n-2}$ ways to reach the $(n-2)$-th step.
Therefore, $S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}$.

$S_1 = 1$
$S_2 = 2$
$S_3 = S_2 + S_1 = 2 + 1 = 3$
$S_4 = S_3 + S_2 = 3 + 2 = 5$

# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)11', 'C)12', 'D)13', 'E)14']","Let the remainder be 'r'.
According to the problem, when 2272 is divided by N, the remainder is r.
2272 = Nq1 + r (where q1 is the quotient)
Also, when 875 is divided by N, the remainder is r.
875 = Nq2 + r (where q2 is the quotient)
Subtracting the two equations, we get:
2272 - 875 = Nq1 + r - (Nq2 + r)
1397 = N(q1 - q2)
This means that 1397 is divisible by N.
Since N is a 3-digit number, we need to find the 3-digit factors of 1397.
The prime factorization of 1397 is 11 x 127.
The 3-digit factors of 1397 are 127. (11 is not a 3-digit number and 11 x 127 = 1397 is a 4-digit number).
Therefore, N = 127.

232,"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)8', 'C)22', 'D)50', 'E)20']","Jack cleans the yacht in 12 hours. So in 1 hour, Jack cleans 1/12 of the yacht.
Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means 2/3 of the yacht is cleaned.
The remaining portion of work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the yacht.
Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate. So Jill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.
Remaining work is 1/3 of the yacht.
Time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work = (Remaining work) / (Jill's rate)
Time = (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * 240 = 80 hours.
So, it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.


Since 80 is not an option, let's reconsider the percentage. Perhaps it means Jill cleans 5% * Jack's time, meaning 5% * 12 hours = 0.6 hours to clean the entire yacht, or 1/0.6 = 5/3 yachts/hour.
Remaining portion: 1/3 of yacht.  Time: (1/3 yacht) / (5/3 yacht/hr) = 1/5 hr = 0.2 * 60 min = 12 minutes
If Jill's rate is 5/100 = 1/20 of the area that Jack cleans in 1 hour, then it would take Jill 20 * 12 hours = 240 hours to clean the entire yacht.
Remaining portion is 1/3 of the yacht, and her speed is 1/240 yacht/hr. Thus she needs (1/3)/(1/240) = 80 hours.
So if Jack does 2/3 of the work, it takes him (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours. Remaining work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.
Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Jack's rate is 1/12. So Jill's rate is 0.05 * 1/12 = 1/240.
Jill's time to finish the remaining 1/3 is (1/3)/(1/240) = 80 hours.

233,"Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum?
# Answer option: ['A)2%', 'B)8%', 'C)5%', 'D)10%', 'E)None of these']","Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 5000

# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)28', 'C)46', 'D)66', 'E)70']","Here's how we can solve this problem:

1. **Identify the combinations that exceed $4:**  We need to find combinations of three candy bars that cost more than $4.  Here are the possible scenarios:
    * Three $2 candy bars: This totals $6.
    * Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: This totals $5.
    * One $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars: This totals $4 (doesn't meet the criteria).
    * Two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar: This totals $4.50.
    * One $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar and one $0.50 candy bar: This totals $3.50.


2. **Calculate the number of ways for each scenario:**
    * Three $2 candy bars: There are 4 such candy bars, so the number of ways to choose 3 is 4C3 = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4.
    * Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar:  4C2 * 4C1 = (4! / (2! * 2!)) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24.
    * Two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar: 4C2 * 3C1 = (4! / (2! * 2!)) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18.

237,"At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
# Answer option: ['A)120', 'B)19', 'C)180', 'D)420', 'E)460']","There are a total of 8 people on the team (4 men and 4 women). We need to choose 4 presenters, but the group of presenters cannot be all men or all women.

First, let's find the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the 8 team members without any restrictions. This can be done in 8C4 ways, which is:
8C4 = 8! / (4! * 4!) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1) = 70

Now, we need to subtract the cases where the presenters are all men or all women.
The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 men is 4C4 = 1.
The number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 women is 4C4 = 1.

So, the number of ways to choose 4 presenters such that the group is not composed of only men or only women is:
70 - 1 - 1 = 68

However, since the question gives the wrong answer, let's consider the possibility of having exactly 2 men and 2 women. If there MUST be 2 of each then we have:
(4C2)*(4C2) = (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = (6) * (6) = 36
Given the answer choices, let's explore another possibility, that there are at least one man and one woman.  
Total ways to choose 4 people: 8C4 = 70
Ways to choose only men: 4C4 = 1
Ways to choose only women: 4C4 = 1
Ways to choose at least one man and one woman: 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.
Alternatively:

1 man 3 women 4C1*4C3 = 4*4=16
2 men 2 woman 4C2*4C2 = 6*6 =36
3 men 1 woman 4C3*4C1 = 4*4=16
Adding the three together we get 16+36+16=68

238,"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)100', 'C)150', 'D)200', 'E)70']","Let 'x' be the total number of children in the class.
The number of boys in the class is 100.
The fraction of girls in the class is 2/5. This means the fraction of boys in the class is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.
Since there are 100 boys, and they represent 3/5 of the class, we can set up the equation:
(3/5) * x = 100
Multiply both sides by 5/3:
x = 100 * (5/3)
x = 500/3
So, the total number of children in the class is 500/3.
The number of girls is (2/5) * x = (2/5) * (500/3) = 200/3 ≈ 66.67. However, since the number of students must be an integer, we made an error somewhere. 
Instead, we know the boys make up 3/5 of the class, so if there are 100 boys then 100 = 3/5 * total number of children. This gives us that the total number of children is equal to 100 * 5/3 = 500/3. So the number of girls is 2/5 * total number of children or 2/5 * 500/3 = 200/3. 
However, we can rephrase it as ""boys make up 3 parts and girls make up 2 parts."" So the total is 5 parts. 3 parts are equal to 100 boys, so 1 part is equal to 100/3. The number of girls corresponds to 2 parts which means that number of girls = 2 * 100/3 = 200/3.
If there are 100 boys and they represent 3/5 of the class, then 1/5 of the class is 100/3. The girls make up 2/5 of the class so there are 2 * (100/3) = 200/3 girls. This question is probably wrong but I'll choose the closest answer.

# Answer option: ['A)5/7', 'B)3/5', 'C)4/7', 'D)2/5', 'E)2/7']","Here's how to solve this:

1. **Prime Factorization of 1000:**  1000 = 2^3 * 5^3

2. **Numbers NOT relatively prime to 1000:**  A number is not relatively prime to 1000 if it shares a factor of 2 or 5 with 1000.

3. **Probability of sharing a factor of 2:**  Half the numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 2 (i.e., even).  Probability = 1/2

4. **Probability of sharing a factor of 5:** One-fifth of the numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 5.  Probability = 1/5

5. **Probability of sharing BOTH factors (divisible by 10):** One-tenth of the numbers are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10). Probability = 1/10

6. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   P(2 or 5) = P(2) + P(5) - P(2 and 5)
   P(2 or 5) = (1/2) + (1/5) - (1/10)
   P(2 or 5) = 5/10 + 2/10 - 1/10
   P(2 or 5) = 6/10 = 3/5

7. **Probability of being relatively prime:** Since 3/5 of the numbers share a factor with 1000, the remaining 2/5 are relatively prime.

240,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
# Answer option: ['A)$45,000', 'B)$50,000', 'C)$54,000', 'D)$59,000', 'E)$62,000']","Let P be the principal amount Charles originally invested.
The annual interest rate is 8%, compounded semi-annually.
So, the interest rate per half-year is 8%/2 = 4% = 0.04.
The number of compounding periods in one year is 2.
The future value (FV) of the investment after one year is given by the formula:
FV = P * (1 + r)^n
where r is the interest rate per compounding period and n is the number of compounding periods.
In this case, FV = $54,080, r = 0.04, and n = 2.
So, we have:
$54,080 = P * (1 + 0.04)^2
$54,080 = P * (1.04)^2
$54,080 = P * 1.0816
P = $54,080 / 1.0816
P = $50,000

241,"Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?
# Answer option: ['A)45', 'B)48', 'C)50', 'D)55', 'E)58']","Let J, S, and F represent the current ages of Joe, his sister, and his father, respectively.
We are given that J + S + F = 100.

Let's analyze the second statement: ""When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.""
The age difference between Joe and his father is F - J. So, when Joe is as old as his father, it will take F - J years. At that time, the sister's age will be S + (F - J), and this is equal to 2S.
So, S + F - J = 2S, which simplifies to F - J = S.

Now, let's analyze the third statement: ""When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.""
When Joe is as old as his father, the father's age will be F + (F - J) = 2F - J.
The sister was as old as her father when the sister's age was F. This happened F - S years ago.
At that time, the father's age was F - (F - S) = S.
So, according to the statement, 2F - J = 2 * S.

We have three equations:
1. J + S + F = 100
2. F - J = S
3. 2F - J = 2S

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
J + (F - J) + F = 100
2F = 100
F = 50

Substitute F = 50 into equation (2):
50 - J = S

Substitute F = 50 into equation (3):
2(50) - J = 2S
100 - J = 2S

Since 50 - J = S, we have 2S = 100 - 2J.
So, 100 - J = 100 - 2J
J = 0.

This doesn't make sense. However, let's re-examine the third statement: ""When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.""
When Joe's age is F, the time elapsed is F-J.
Father's age will be F+(F-J) = 2F-J.

Sister was as old as the father F-S years ago.
At that time father's age was S.
So, 2F-J = 2S
2(50) - J = 2S
100-J = 2S
F-J = S => 50-J = S
100-J = 2(50-J)
100-J = 100-2J
J = 0.
However the father's age is 50.

x = (m/100) * 4y
x = (4my)/100

We want to find m as a percentage of x. Let's represent this percentage as p.
m = (p/100) * x

Now substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation:
m = (p/100) * (4my/100)
m = (4mpy)/10000

Now, we want to solve for p in terms of y. Divide both sides by m (since m > 0):
1 = (4py)/10000
Multiply both sides by 10000:
10000 = 4py
Divide both sides by 4y (since y > 0):
p = 10000 / 4y
p = 2500/y

Therefore, m is 2500/y percent of x.
