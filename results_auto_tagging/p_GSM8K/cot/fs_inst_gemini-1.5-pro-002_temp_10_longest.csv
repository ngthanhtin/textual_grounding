0,"Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Explanation:
Since 3 other people bid on the desk and the bids increase by $50 each time, the price increased by 3*$50 = $150 from the other bidders. 
This makes the price of the desk $200 + $150 = $350 before Carmen makes the winning bid.
Since Carmen bids after each of the other people, she makes the winning bid, increasing the price by another $50.
Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $350 + $50 = $400.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Explanation: First find the total time in minutes it takes to peel one potato: 1 minute/potato + 30 seconds/potato / 60 seconds/minute = 1.5 minutes/potato
Then multiply that rate by the total number of potatoes to find the total peeling time: 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
Then divide the number of seconds it takes to cut one potato by the number of seconds in a minute to find how much of a minute it takes to cut each potato: 5 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 1/12 minute
Then multiply that rate by the total number of potatoes to find the total cutting time: 1/12 minute/potato * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes
Then add the total cutting and peeling time to find the total prep time: 5 minutes + 90 minutes = 95 minutes

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Explanation:
He bought 10 CDs at $15 each so that's 10*15 = $150 spent
He got a 40% discount meaning he only paid 60% of the price: 150*.6 = $90
He sold 5 for $40 so that means he lost 90-40 = $50

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Explanation:
First find the total number of seats in the auditorium: 18 seats/row * 4 rows = 72 seats
Then multiply that number by 1/4 to find how many seats the administrators occupied: 72 seats * (1/4) = 18 seats
Then subtract the number of seats the administrators occupied from the total number of seats to find the number of seats remaining: 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats
Then multiply the number of remaining seats by 1/3 to find how many seats the parents occupied: 54 seats * (1/3) = 18 seats
Then subtract the number of seats the parents occupied from the number of remaining seats to find the number of seats the students occupied: 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats
So the answer is 36

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Explanation: Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Calculate total chips:** Milo has 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 glass chips.
* **Chips needed for the height:** His mosaic is 3 inches tall * 12 chips/inch = 36 chips needed for the height.
* **Chips remaining for length:** Milo has 144 total chips â€“ 36 chips for height = 108 chips left for the length.
* **Inches of mosaic length:** He can make 108 chips / 12 chips/inch = 9 inches of length.

7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","Explanation:
They sold 5 vanilla scents * 4 kinds of vanilla scents = 20 bottles of vanilla scents.
They also sold 2 fruit scents * 8 kinds of fruit scents = 16 bottles of fruit scents.
That means they sold 20 bottles of vanilla scents - 16 bottles of fruit scents = 4 more vanilla scents.

Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","Explanation: First find the total cost of the asphalt: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75
Then add that cost to the cost of the fine to find Ron's total cost to fix the pothole: $75 + $120 = $195
Then subtract that cost from the cost of the damage to his car to find how much money he saves: $450 - $195 = $255

His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","First find the total area of the room by multiplying the length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet
Then multiply that area by the cost to remove the old carpet to find the total removal cost: 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
Then multiply the area of the room by the cost per square foot of the new carpet to find the total cost of the carpet: 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592
Then multiply the area of the room by the cost per square foot of the padding to find the total cost of the padding: 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
Then multiply the area of the room by the cost per square foot of installation to find the total cost of installation: 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344
Then add the cost of removing the old carpet, the new carpet, the padding, and the installation to find the total cost: $864 + $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $11232

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Explanation:
First find how many apples Joanne picked from the shortest trees: 30 apples / 2 = 15 apples
Then find how many apples her sister picked from the tallest trees: 30 apples * 2 = 60 apples
Then find how many apples her sister picked from the shortest trees: 15 apples * 3 = 45 apples
Then add those amounts to find the total number of apples her sister picked: 60 apples + 45 apples = 105 apples
Then subtract the number of apples her sister picked and the number Joanne picked from the tallest and shortest trees from the total number of apples to find the number Joanne picked from average trees: 500 apples - 105 apples - 30 apples - 15 apples = 350 apples

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","First find the total amount of space between the plants: 1.5 feet/plant * 17 plants = 25.5 feet
Then subtract that amount from the total length of the flower bed to find the amount of space in the flower bed that will not be occupied by a plant: 111 feet - 25.5 feet = 85.5 feet
Then add the width of a plant to the amount of space that needs to be between plants to find the total amount of space one plant takes up in the flower bed: 12 inches + 1.5 feet = 2.25 feet
Then convert the width of the plant from inches to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot
Then add that number to the amount of space between each plant to find the total amount of space each plant takes up in the flower bed: 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet
Then divide the amount of space in the flower bed that will not be occupied by a plant by the total amount of space one plant takes up in the flower bed to find how many more plants can fit in the flower bed:  85.5 feet / 2.5 feet/plant = 34.2 plants
Since you can't have .2 of a plant round down to 34 plants
Now add the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed to the number of plants she already owns to find the total number of plants Pat will have in her flower bed: 34 plants + 17 plants = 51 plants
Then multiply that number by the cost of each plant to find the total amount of money Pat will spend: 51 plants * $6/plant = $306

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","Explanation:
On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, leaving 100% - 45% = 55% of the chalk remaining. 
The teacher wants to use 20% of the chalk each day, and he has 55% / 20% per day = 2.75 days worth of chalk left. 
However, since he can only use whole days, he has 2 full days left before he has to recycle the chalk.

So the north and south walls together have a combined area of 80*2=160 square feet.
The east and west walls each have an area of 5*8=40 square feet.
So the east and west walls together have a combined area of 40*2=80 square feet.
The total area of the walls in the room is 160+80=240 square feet.

20,"On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","Explanation:
The hotel had 100 - 24 = 76 guests after the early checkout.
30 guests checked in the afternoon, which is twice the number of people who opted for a late checkout (15 x 2 = 30).
So there were 76 + 30 = 106 guests before the late checkout.

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Explanation: First, figure out how many days Andy has to lose weight: July is 7 months into the year, and his birthday is on the 19th, giving him 7*30+19 = 229 days. However, January has 31 days, not 30, so add one more day: 229 + 1 = 230 days.  Subtract the remaining days in December to find the total number of days Andy has to lose weight: 230 - 1 = 229 days.

Next, calculate Andy's total calorie deficit by multiplying the number of pounds he wants to lose by the number of calories he needs to burn per pound: 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105000 calories.

Finally, divide Andy's total calorie deficit by the number of days he has to lose weight to find his daily calorie deficit: 105000 calories / 229 days = 458.5 calories/day.

The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","Explanation:
Here's how to break down the problem:

* **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
* **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times faster, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Final 30 seconds:** The rate slows to half of the previous 30 seconds, meaning 60 / 2 = 30 kernels pop.
* **Residual heat:** After taking the pan off the heat, 30 / 4 = 7.5 kernels pop (we'll round down to 7 since you can't have half a kernel).
* **Total:** Garrett has 20 + 60 + 30 + 7 = 117 pieces of popcorn.

30,"An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","Explanation:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the cost of a watermelon:**

* Each pepper costs $15.
* A watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper, so it costs $15 * 3 = $45.

**2. Calculate the cost of an orange:**

* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs $45 - $5 = $40.

**3. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**

* Dillon buys 4 watermelons at $45 each, so the total cost is 4 * $45 = $180.

**4. Calculate the total cost of the peppers:**

* Dillon buys 20 peppers at $15 each, so the total cost is 20 * $15 = $300.

**5. Calculate the total cost of the oranges:**

* Dillon buys 10 oranges at $40 each, so the total cost is 10 * $40 = $400.

**6. Calculate the total cost of all the fruits:**

* The total cost is $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Therefore, Dillon will spend $880 in total.**

How many times did the alarm ring in all?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Second alarm:** The second alarm rang three times as long as the first alarm, which rang 4 times. So, the second alarm rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
* **Third alarm:** The third alarm rang half as long as the second alarm, which rang 12 times. So, the third alarm rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.
* **Total rings:** In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

32,Jim has a 20 pack of gum.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?,"Explanation:
First find the total number of hours Jim is at school: 8 hours/school day * 1 school day = 8 hours
Then multiply that number by the number of pieces of gum he chews per hour at school to find how many pieces he chews at school: 8 hours * 1 piece/2 hours = 4 pieces
Then add the number of pieces he chews on his way home from school and the number he chews after dinner to find his total gum consumption for the day: 4 pieces + 1 piece + 1 piece = 6 pieces
Then subtract that number from his starting number of pieces of gum to find how many pieces he has left before giving some to his sister: 20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces
Then divide that number in half to find how many pieces he gives to his sister: 14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces
Then subtract that number from the number of pieces he had left to find how many pieces he has left at the end of the day: 14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**

* **Sugar Cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
* **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

**2. Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**

* 2 pounds + 1300 pounds + 3150 pounds + 48 pounds = 4500 pounds

**3. Determine the number of trips:**

* 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

40,A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"Explanation:
Jack can play for 20 minutes on one quarter, which means he can play for 20*3=60 minutes in an hour.
There are 4 quarters in a dollar so he spends 60/4=$15 per hour.
His friend who is better than him can therefore play for 20*1.5=30 minutes on a quarter.
This means he can play for 30*2=60 minutes in an hour.
He also spends 60/4=$15 an hour.
His two other friends can only play for 20/2=10 minutes on one quarter.
That means they can play for 10*6=60 minutes in an hour.
They also each spend 60/4=$15 per hour.
In total, the group spends 15*4=$60 an hour.
That means for a 4 hour session, they spent 60*4=$240.

A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"First find the number of movies in a series: 600 movies * (1/3) = 200 movies
Then subtract that number from the total number of movies to find the number that aren't in a series: 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies
Then multiply that number by the percentage that are older to find how many movies are older: 400 movies * 40% = 160 movies
Then subtract the number of older movies and the number of movies in a series from the total number of movies to find the number of normal movies: 600 movies - 160 movies - 200 movies = 240 movies
Then multiply the number of older movies by their price to find their total cost: 160 movies * $5 = $800
Then multiply the number of normal movies by their price to find their total cost: 240 movies * $10 = $2400
Then multiply the number of movies in series by their discounted price to find their total cost: 200 movies * $6 = $1200
Then add the three costs together to find the total cost: $800 + $2400 + $1200 = $4400

Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","Explanation: Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the battery loss over the last 3 hours.** The battery lost 7% per hour for 3 hours, a total of 7 * 3 = 21%.
* **Step 2: Calculate the battery charge before the last 3 hours.**  Before the last 3 hours, the battery was at 28% + 21% = 49%.
* **Step 3:  Calculate how much battery was used in the first 5 hours.** This means the battery went from 100% down to 49% in 5 hours, a loss of 100% - 49% = 51%.
* **Step 4: Calculate the battery loss per hour during the first 5 hours.** Over 5 hours, the battery lost 51%, so it was losing 51% / 5 hours = 10.2% per hour. 
* **Step 5:  Determine if the battery was fully charged when Maria left for the park.** Since the battery was losing charge at a rate of 10.2% per hour and it was at 49% after 5 hours, it means it was not fully charged when she left.

Answer: {The power bank was not fully charged when Maria went to the park.}

She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","Explanation: Rose started with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals.
Then she added 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.
Next she added 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.
At this point she had 15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals = 59 petals.
She lost 3 flowers total, so she lost 3 petals from dropping and having the wind blow them away.
She had 59 petals - 3 petals = 56 petals remaining.
Her last group of flowers added 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals.
She dropped one of these flowers, so she lost 7 petals.
This left her with 42 petals - 7 petals = 35 petals.
In total she had 56 petals + 35 petals = 91 petals.

And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","Explanation: If each of Tobias' howls last for 20 seconds, and he howls once every time he howls, then he spends 20*1=20 seconds howling each time he howls.
We are told that Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 20*2=40 seconds.
And Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, so he howls for 40+20=60 seconds.
Therefore, the total time for all three wolves to howl is 20+40+60=120 seconds.
Finally, since there are 60 seconds in every minute, the wolves howl for a total of 120/60=2 minutes.

The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","Explanation:
Let's calculate the cost for Clara first. 20 pomegranates at $20 each cost 20 * $20 = $400.
After the voucher discount, Clara paid $400 - $2 = $398.
Now let's calculate the cost for Sheila. 20 pomegranates at $30 each cost 20 * $30 = $600.
A 10% discount on $600 is $600 * (10/100) = $60.
Therefore Sheila paid $600 - $60 = $540.
The difference between the final prices is $540 - $398 = $142.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","Here's how we can solve this:

1. **Bottom Shelf Capacity:** Since each middle shelf holds 10 books, the bottom shelf holds 10 * 2 = 20 books.

2. **Top Shelf Capacity:** The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

3. **Total Capacity per Bookcase:**  One bookcase can hold 20 (bottom) + 10 (middle) + 10 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

4. **Number of Bookcases Needed:** Elly needs enough bookcases to hold 110 books, and each bookcase holds 55, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  The returned item cost $15.00. What is the new balance on her credit card?","Explanation: First find how much money was credited back to her account: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
Then multiply the price of the frying pan by the discount percentage to find the discount: $20.00 x .20 = $4.00
Then subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

70,"Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","Explanation:
First find how many points Betty collected: 50 points * 0.3 = 15 points more than Adam.
So Betty has 50 points + 15 points = 65 points.
Tom has 65 points - 30 points = 35 points.
Marta collected 3 * 35 points = 105 points.
Altogether, the students in class 3B have 50 points + 65 points + 35 points + 105 points = 255 points.
That means they are missing 400 points - 255 points = 145 points.

71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Explanation:
After buying the fish, Bob had 7 + 17 = 24 fish.
Since twice as many of these were orange, Bob had 24 / 3 x 2 = 16 orange fish.
This means he bought 16 - 3 = 13 new orange fish.
Therefore, he must have bought 17 - 13 = 4 white fish.

73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Explanation: The two fastest workers produce 2 workers * 6 toys/hour/worker = 12 toys/hour
The two slower workers produce 2 workers * 4 toys/hour/worker = 8 toys/hour.
So in their 10-hour shift, the four workers produce (12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour) * 10 hours = 200 toys
This means the fifth worker produced 400 total toys - 20 toys still needed - 200 toys = 180 toys during the shift.
Therefore, the fifth worker produces 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","Explanation:
The jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
Cole bought the two jeans for a total of $28 + $22 = $50.
Before the sale, the total cost of the two jeans was $50 + $6 = $56.
He saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans.
So, the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.
Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $28 = $4 more than the tattered jeans.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","Explanation: Let's figure out how much TV time, in minutes, Frankie racked up from Monday to Friday:
* Monday: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes
* Tuesday: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes
* Thursday: (1 hour * 60 minutes/hour) + 30 minutes = 90 minutes
* Friday: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
That's 60 + 60 + 90 + 120 = 330 minutes of TV from Monday to Friday.
Since he watched 7 hours in total, that's 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes.
Subtracting the time from Monday to Friday, we get 420 minutes - 330 minutes = 90 minutes of TV on Wednesday.
Finally, divide that by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 minutes / 30 minutes/episode = 3 episodes.

If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?","Explanation:
1. **Wayne's travel time:** Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater.

2. **Bernadette's travel time:** Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, so it takes her 4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. **Bernadette's target arrival:** She wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

4. **Calculate Bernadette's departure time:**  She needs to leave 16 minutes (travel time) + 5 minutes (early arrival) = 21 minutes before Wayne.

96,"To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day than he planted on the first day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","Explanation: On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak, a total of 20 trees * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.
Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees.
On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, a total of 20 trees + 10 trees = 30 White Oak trees.
He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine on the second day than on the first day, which is equivalent to 40 trees * (1/4) = 10 more trees.
So, on the second day, he planted a total of 40 trees + 10 trees = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.
In total, Mr. Julius planted 30 White Oak trees + 50 Lodgepole Pine trees = 80 trees on the second day.
Therefore, across the two days, Mr. Julius planted a total of 60 trees + 80 trees = 140 trees.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"Explanation:
First find the total number of miles driven to work and back in a day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
Then multiply that number by the rate per mile to find the daily driving cost: 60 miles * $2/mile = $120
Then multiply that number by the number of days he works in a week to find his weekly driving cost: $120/day * 5 days/week = $600/week
Then multiply that by the number of weeks he works in a year to find his total yearly driving cost: $600/week * 50 weeks/year = $30,000/year
Then multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year to find his total bonus paid in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year
Then add that number to the yearly driving cost to find the total cost of driving for the year: $30,000/year + $1800/year = $31,800/year

He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","Explanation: Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Start with the current number of cookies:** Henry has 110 cookies after dropping some.
* **Account for the dropped cookies:** He dropped 5, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
* **Account for the extra cookies:** He baked 15 extra, so he originally intended to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
* **Calculate last year's cookies:** He wanted to bake twice as many as last year, meaning he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.

101,"Cameron arrives at 5 pm at a hotel in the Philippines and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.  The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","Explanation:
Since Cameron wants to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next day, which is 17 hours, he only needs to pay an additional 5 hours after the initial 12 hours. 
That means he would need to pay 70 pesos/hour * 5 hours = 350 pesos for the additional hours.
Therefore, his total cost would be 1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos. 
This would save him 1600 pesos (24-hour rate) - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","Explanation:
1. **Cinnamon cups:** Lana starts with 27 cups and uses 15 for cinnamon tea, leaving her with 27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea.

2. **Cups per row:**  These 12 cups are divided equally into 3 rows, meaning there are 12 / 3 = 4 cups per row for chamomile and mint combined.

3. **Mint cups per row:** Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint, there are 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

104,"Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?","Explanation:
If Becky ate 10 slices and this was 3 more than Jake ate, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.
Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so she ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices. 
Together, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.
They shared 4 pizzas, and since each pizza has 8 slices, they had a total of 4 * 8 = 32 slices.
Therefore, they ate 31 out of the 32 total slices.

There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?","Explanation:
First find the total number of small candles they have: 4 candles/half the rooms * 8 rooms / 2 half rooms = 16 candles
Then find the total number of medium candles they have: 5 candles/half the rooms * 8 rooms / 2 half rooms = 20 candles
Then add those two amounts to find the total number of candles: 16 candles + 20 candles = 36 candles
Then multiply the number of people by the number of flashlights they each carry to find the total number of flashlights people are carrying: 4 people * 1 flashlight/person = 4 flashlights
Then multiply the number of rooms by the number of flashlights in each room to find the total number of flashlights in rooms: 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights
Then add the number of flashlights people are carrying to the number of flashlights in rooms to find the total number of flashlights: 4 flashlights + 16 flashlights = 20 flashlights
Then add the total number of candles to the total number of flashlights to find the total number of candles and flashlights: 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56 candles and flashlights

In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Explanation:
We need to figure out the total cups of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day. Then, we can figure out how many cups are left for the final meal.

* **Morning and Afternoon:** She gives 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon.
* **Total Daily Needs:** Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups of feed per day.
* **Final Meal:** To find out how much she needs for the final meal, subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily need: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Explanation:
First find the probability that Marcus will *not* get an extension from the normal teacher: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then multiply that probability by the probability that his dog ate his assignment story won't work to find the probability he'll have to do the homework if the normal teacher is there: 60% * 80% = 48%
Then multiply the probability of having a substitute by the probability he won't have to do the homework if there is a substitute to find the probability he won't have to do it if there's a sub: 50% * 100% = 50%
Then subtract that percentage from 100% to find the probability he will have to do it if there's a sub: 100% - 50% = 50%
Finally, add the probability of having to do the homework if the normal teacher is there to the probability of having to do it if there is a substitute to get the overall probability: 50% + 48% = 98%

A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Lorraine trades 50/100 * 40 large stickers = 20 large stickers for large buttons.
So she has 40 large stickers - 20 large stickers = 20 large stickers left that she trades for small buttons.
This gets her 20 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons.
She also trades 90/100 * 30 small stickers = 27 small stickers for large buttons.
This gets her 27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons.
Her 20 large stickers traded for large buttons gets her another 20 large buttons.
That means by the end, Lorraine has 60 small buttons + 9 large buttons + 20 large buttons = 89 buttons.

He sold 10 x 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.
So, there are 55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.

131,"John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  He sells planks for $1.2 each. He can make logs out of 80% of the tree. From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  How much does he make?","Explanation:
First find the percentage of the tree John makes into logs: 80 feet * .80 = 64 feet
Then divide the useable length of the tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs: 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs
Then multiply that number by the number of planks per log to find how many planks he sells: 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks
Then multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find the total profit: 80 planks * $1.20/plank = $96.00

132,Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"Explanation:
He needs enough sandwiches for 20/4 = 5 groups of 4 people.
So, he needs to buy 5 * 1 = 5 pounds of meat.
He also needs to buy 5 * 1 = 5 pounds of cheese.
The meat will cost $7.00/pound * 5 pounds = $35.00
The cheese will cost $3.00/pound * 5 pounds = $15.00
Therefore, he will spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on the meat and cheese.

133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"Explanation:
1. **Calculate Cole's eggs:** Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
2. **Calculate Stacy's eggs:** Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar, who found 5, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
3. **Calculate Charlie's eggs:** Charlie found 2 fewer eggs than Stacy, who found 10, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
4. **Calculate Mei's eggs:** Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie, who found 8, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
5. **Calculate the total found:** In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
6. **Calculate the remaining eggs:**  Subtract the number of found eggs from the total hidden eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","Explanation: Nik has 200 / 8 = 25 groups of 8 crayons.
That means he needs 25 boxes.
The total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.
This is equal to 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.
The total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.
This is equal to 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.
Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds.

He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2. How much did everything cost?,"Explanation:
Roger drinks 1 pound of coffee per day and buys enough for 7 days so that's 1*7 = 7 pounds of coffee
The more expensive coffee is 20/100 * 5 = $1 more expensive per pound.

136,"Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. 11 students need size extra-small.  Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Twice as many students need size small as extra small.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Explanation:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

* **Small:** Twice the number of extra-small students need small shirts, so 11 students * 2 = 22 students need size small.
* **Medium:** Four less than the number of small students need medium, meaning 22 students â€“ 4 students = 18 students need size medium.
* **Large:** Half as many students need large as medium, so 18 students / 2 = 9 students need size large.
* **Extra-Large:** Six more students need extra-large than large, meaning 9 students + 6 students = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts:

* **Total:** 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) + 11 (extra-small) = 75 shirts

137,"Colby loves going to the movies and already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy this month. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?","Explanation:
First find the total cost of the movies Colby has already seen: 5 movies * $10/movie + 8 movies * $7/movie = $50 + $56 = $106.
Then find the total cost of the food he has already bought: 2 tubs * $8/tub + 4 boxes * $2/box = $16 + $8 = $24.
So he has spent $106 + $24 = $130 at the movies so far this month.
That means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend on movies this month.
He wants to get popcorn and candy this time, so that will cost $8 + $2 = $10.
That leaves $20 - $10 = $10 to spend on movie tickets.
Since it is Friday, tickets cost $10 each, so he can buy $10 / $10 per ticket = 1 more movie ticket.

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Explanation:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) Tanya uses.**

* **Salt and sugar:** She uses the same amount of salt and sugar as each other, and this amount is twice the amount of zest. So, she uses 2*x ounces of salt and 2*x ounces of sugar.

* **Oil:**  She uses twice as much oil as salt. Since she uses 2*x ounces of salt, she uses 2 * (2*x) = 4*x ounces of oil.

**To find the amount of oil, we need to find the value of 'x'.  However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact proportions of each ingredient in the 10-ounce jar.  We only know the *ratios* of ingredients to one another.**

One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","Explanation:
Let's calculate the cost of each fruit:
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, which costs $0.5, so a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.
- An orange costs three times as much as a banana, which costs $1, so an orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1/banana = $5.
- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5/apple = $6.
- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3/orange = $21.

At this time, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?","Explanation:
First find the number of blue balloons Sally added to her collection: 8 balloons * .75 = 6 balloons
Then calculate how many red balloons burst: 25 balloons * .40 = 10 balloons 
Then subtract that number from her original number of red balloons to find how many red balloons remain: 25 balloons - 10 balloons = 15 balloons
Then divide the original number of yellow balloons in half to find how many she accidentally released: 12 balloons / 2 = 6 balloons
Then subtract that number from the original number of yellow balloons to find how many yellow balloons remain: 12 balloons - 6 balloons = 6 balloons.
Now add up the number of each color balloon to find the total number of balloons she had before picking up the blue balloons: 15 balloons + 7 balloons + 6 balloons = 28 balloons

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","Explanation: Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Third day:** They used half a bulk pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
* **Total used in the first three days:**  They had 78 bandages left and used 25 on the third day, so they used a total of 78 + 25 = 103 bandages in the first three days.
* **Second day:** They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
* **Total used in the first two days:**  They used 38 on the first day and 28 on the second day, for a total of 38 + 28 = 66 bandages.
* **Bandages after the first order:** Since they used 103 bandages in total and 66 in the first two days, they must have used 103 - 66 = 37 bandages after the first order. 
* **Bandages at the start of the first day:** They ordered a bulk pack (50 bandages) and had 37 left after using some, so they started with 50 - 37 = 13 bandages.

164,"Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. When Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","Explanation:
1. **Find Gordy's capacity:** Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's 4,000 pounds, so Gordy can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

2. **Find the combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy:** Together, they can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

3. **Find Gary's capacity:** Since the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds, and Gissela and Gordy together haul 8,800 pounds, Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

165,"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","Explanation:
At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
The island had 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.
From the first to the third day, they dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.
They filled in 2 of the holes so at the end of the third day, there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
That means they dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day.

166,"Mr. Robles' first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Explanation:
The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day so in a week (7 days), it eats 10*7= 70 bananas.
That leaves 315 - 70 = 245 bananas for the second and third monkey.
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey which is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.
That means the second monkey eats 14*7 = 98 bananas in a week
So the third monkey eats 245 - 98 = 147 bananas in a week.
Therefore, the third monkey eats 147/7 = 21 bananas a day.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Explanation:
The hamsters use a total of 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.
This leaves 160 pieces total - 50 for hamsters - 20 for rabbits = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.
This means there are 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats in total.
Therefore, each cage has 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats.

And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","Explanation:
Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 75 large beans * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.
Because eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans * 3 = 450 small beans.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","Explanation: 
Let's break down Elaine's Pokemon card collection month by month:

* **Month 1:** Elaine starts with 20 cards.
* **Month 2:** She collects 3 times the initial amount, meaning she collects 20 cards * 3 = 60 cards. However, she also collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, making it 60 cards - 20 cards = 40 cards collected in the second month. 
* **Month 3:** She collects twice the combined amount from the first two months. Combined, she had 20 cards + 40 cards = 60 cards.  Twice this amount is 60 cards * 2 = 120 cards in the third month.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","Explanation:
First find the total time the first train is at the station: 10 minutes (arrival) + 20 minutes (stay) = 30 minutes
Then find how long the second train is at the station: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes
Then determine when the second train arrives: 30 minutes (first train) + 30 minutes (half hour) = 60 minutes
Then determine when the second train leaves: 60 minutes (second train arrival) + 5 minutes (second train stay) = 65 minutes

200,"Mr. Rogers sold a watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it.  The watch was originally $2000, but was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","Explanation: Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the sale price:** Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75/100 * $2000 = $1500.

2. **Calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch:** He sold it for 120/100 * $1500 = $1800.

3. **Calculate the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received:** The discount is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

4. **Calculate the percentage discount:** The percentage discount is ($200/$2000) * 100% = 10%.

201,"James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","Explanation:
First find the distance James swims: 20 miles * .60 = 12 miles
Then calculate how long it took him to swim that distance: 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours
Then divide that time in half to find his resting time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours
Then find the remaining distance: 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles
Then divide his speed in half to find his slower speed: 2 mph / 2 = 1 mph
Then calculate how long it took him to swim the rest of the way: 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours
Then add all the times together to find the total time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

202,"Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\""  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?","Explanation: The taffy costs 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 sets of 1.5 pounds. Since she can only buy the taffy in sets of 1.5 pounds, we round 1.33 up to 2. This means she bought 2 sets of taffy * 1.5 pounds per set = 3 pounds of taffy. Since taffy costs $3 per pound, she spent 3 * $3 = $9 on taffy. The 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, in total, she spent $9 + $1.50 + $1 = $11.50. Thus, she has $10 - $11.50 = -$1.50 left.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Explanation:
Let 'x' be the number of guests.
The cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x (flat fee + food cost per person).
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per person).
We need to find x when the costs are equal: $200 + $5x = $25x
Solving for x:
$200 = $20x
x = 10 guests

204,"A farmer is baling hay in their field. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?","Explanation:
The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour and works for 6 hours so he makes 5*6 = 30 bales of hay.
The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour and works for 6 hours so it picks up 3*6 = 18 bales of hay.
That means there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales of hay left in the field.

206,"The Science Center hosted field trips Monday through Friday last week. 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 visited on Friday. Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday compared to Monday. On Monday, 32 classes visited. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?","Explanation:
Let's figure out how many classes visited each day:

* **Tuesday:** Twice the number of classes visited on Monday compared to Tuesday, so 32 classes * 2 = 64 classes visited on Tuesday.
* **Wednesday:** Three times the number of classes visited on Monday compared to Wednesday, so 32 classes * 3 = 96 classes visited on Wednesday.

Now let's add up the classes from each day to find the total:

* **Total classes:** 32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247 classes

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Explanation:
Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'x' be the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.**

* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls in the third set as the second set, which is x/2.

* **First set:** He retrieved four more balls in the first set than the second set, which is x + 4.

* **Total:** We know he retrieved 19 balls in total:  (x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Now we can solve for x:

* Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19

* Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15

* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6 

* Now that we know x (balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  Earlier, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?","Explanation:
First find the total number of brownies Greta's friends brought to her party: 4 dozen * 12 brownies/dozen = 48 brownies
Then add the brownies Greta baked to find the total number of brownies at her party: 48 brownies + 12 brownies = 60 brownies
Then find how many brownies were eaten at the office party: 12 brownies / 2 = 6 brownies
Then add that number to the number eaten at Greta's party to find the total number eaten: 6 brownies + 18 brownies = 24 brownies
Then subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies to find how many were left after her party: 60 brownies - 24 brownies = 36 brownies
Then add the brownies from the office party to find the total number of brownies Greta had left: 36 brownies + 6 brownies = 42 brownies

After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"Explanation: The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes her 6 hours. That means each day costs 250*6 = $1500.
The movie needs makeup done 4 times a week so that's 1500*4 = $6000
The movie takes 5 weeks and Jean needs makeup done 4 times a week so that's 5*6000 = $30000 total.
The makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount so that's .10 * 30000 = $3000 off.
That means Jean paid 30000-3000 = $27000.

Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  After 2 months, Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","Explanation: Billy's wage after his first raise was $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.
Billy's wage after his second raise was $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.
Sally's wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
Thus, in a 20-hour workweek, Billy makes 20*$11.50 = $230.
And in that same 20-hour workweek, Sally makes 20*$10.50 = $210.
Therefore, Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally every 20 hours they both work.

Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","Explanation:
The two pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the jacket and shoes cost a total of $30 + $40 = $70.
From babysitting, Sara earns 4 * $5 = $20.
Therefore, Sara has $10 + $20 = $30 before she starts mowing lawns.
This means she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.
So, Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Let's calculate the cost of each item:
* **Cake:** The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2.
* **Soup:** The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.  25% of $4 is (25/100)*$4 = $1. So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
