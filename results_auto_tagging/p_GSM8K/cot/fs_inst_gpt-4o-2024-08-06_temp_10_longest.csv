0,"Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","To determine how much Carmen pays for the desk, we need to first analyze the bidding process:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
   
2. **Bidding Process**: 
   - 3 other people each bid once, making a total of 3 bids. 
   - The bid amount increases by $50 with each bid.
   
3. **Bids Calculation**:
   - After 1 bid from someone else, the bid amount is: $200 + $50 = $250.
   - After 2 bids from the others, the bid amount is: $250 + $50 = $300.
   - After 3 bids from the others, the bid amount is: $300 + $50 = $350.

4. **Carmen's Bids**:
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people have bid, which means she also places 3 bids in total.
   - Her final bid after all three others have bid is: $350 + $50 = $400.

Therefore, Carmen pays $400 for the desk.

1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","To determine how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to track his acquisitions over each year.

1. **Initial Gift**: Steve starts with 5 games that he received with the console on his birthday.

2. **First Year**:
   - Throughout the first year, he saves enough money to buy 1 game per month. Therefore, he buys 1 game x 12 months = 12 games during this year.
   - He also receives 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total games at the end of the first year: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games.

3. **Second Year**:
   - Steve starts buying 2 games per month. Therefore, he buys 2 games x 12 months = 24 games during the second year.
   - He again receives 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total games at the end of the second year: 22 (from first year) + 24 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 51 games.

4. **Third Year**:
   - During his third year, with his part-time job earning him more, Steve buys 4 games per month. Thus, he buys 4 games x 12 months = 48 games during this year.
   - He once again receives 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total games at the end of the third year: 51 (from second year) + 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 104 games.

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has a total of 104 games.

The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","To determine how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to combine the time to peel each potato with the time to cut each one.

1. **Time to peel a potato:** Billy takes 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel one potato.
2. **Time to cut a potato:** It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.

3. **Total time for one potato:** To find the total time to peel and cut one potato, we add the peeling time and cutting time: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds per potato.

4. **Total time for all potatoes:** Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by 60: 
   60 potatoes ร 95 seconds per potato = 5700 seconds in total.

5. **Convert seconds to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we convert the total time in seconds to minutes:
   5700 seconds รท 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping all the potatoes. 

The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"To determine how much money James is out, we need to calculate both his total initial cost for the CDs and the income he received from selling the CDs he didn't like.

1. **Calculate the original cost of each CD:**
   - Each CD costs $15.

2. **Calculate the discount:**
   - James gets 40% off.
   - Therefore, his discount per CD is 40% of $15, which is \( 0.40 \times 15 = \$6 \).

3. **Calculate the discounted price of each CD:**
   - Since he gets a $6 discount on each CD, the price he pays per CD is \( 15 - 6 = \$9 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost for 10 CDs:**
   - Since each CD, after discount, costs $9, the total cost for 10 CDs is \( 10 \times 9 = \$90 \).

5. **Calculate the amount he receives from selling 5 CDs:**
   - He sells 5 CDs and receives $40 in total from this sale.

6. **Determine how much money James is out:**
   - James paid $90 for 10 CDs in total.
   - He sold 5 CDs for $40.
   - The money James is out is the difference between his total cost and the money he received from selling the CDs: \( 90 - 40 = \$50 \).

Therefore, the amount of money James is out is $50.

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"To determine how many students were in the school auditorium, we first need to find out how many total seats are in the auditorium. Since there are 18 seats per row and 4 rows, the total number of seats is:

18 seats/row * 4 rows = 72 seats.

Next, we find how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators:

72 seats / 4 = 18 seats occupied by administrators.

Now, subtract the seats taken by administrators from the total to find the remaining seats:

72 total seats - 18 seats occupied by administrators = 54 remaining seats.

According to the problem, one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. So, the number of seats occupied by parents is:

54 remaining seats / 3 = 18 seats occupied by parents.

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by students is:

54 remaining seats - 18 seats occupied by parents = 36 seats occupied by students.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","To find how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since he has two bags of glass chips and each bag holds 72 chips, he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 glass chips.

2. Calculate the total area in square inches that can be covered by these chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to cover every square inch, the total area Milo can cover is 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

3. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find how many inches long the mosaic can be. The area of the mosaic can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Here, we know the area is 12 square inches and the height (mosaic height) is 3 inches, so:
   \[
   \text{length} \times 3 = 12
   \]

4. Solve for the length:
   \[
   \text{length} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Answer: To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to identify how many miles the first three dogs walk in total and how many miles in total all four dogs need to walk per day.

1. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
2. The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
3. The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

The total distance the first three dogs need to walk is:

1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles

According to the problem, the average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles each, totaling:

4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

Subtracting the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total distance:

12 miles (total needed) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

The answer is {4}."
7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we first calculate the total number of sales for each type of scent.

The perfume company sells 5 of each vanilla scent available, and there are 4 vanilla scents. Therefore, they sell:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents} \times 4 = 20 \text{ vanilla scents in total}. \]

Similarly, the company sells 2 of each fruity scent available, and there are 8 fruity scents. Therefore, they sell:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents} \times 8 = 16 \text{ fruity scents in total}. \]

To find how many more vanilla scents sold compared with fruity scents, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 20 \text{ vanilla scents} - 16 \text{ fruity scents} = 4 \text{ more vanilla scents}. \]

8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the total costs he incurs in each scenario.

1. **If Ron does nothing:**
   - Ron faces $450 worth of damage to his car.

2. **If Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Costs for 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself: $75 + $120 = $195

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the cost of damage if he does nothing:

- Cost if Ron does nothing: $450
- Cost if Ron fixes it himself: $195

The savings are $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The answer is {255}."
9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider several components of the cost:

1. **Room Area Calculation:**
   - Michael's bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
   - The area of the room is calculated as 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

2. **Cost of Removing Old Carpet:**
   - The contractor charges $4 per square foot for removal.
   - Therefore, the cost to remove the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

3. **Cost of the New Carpet:**
   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
   - Therefore, the cost of the new carpet is 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2,592.

4. **Cost of Padding:**
   - The padding costs $2 per square foot.
   - Therefore, the cost for padding is 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

5. **Installation Cost:**
   - The contractor charges $34 per square foot for installing the new carpet.
   - Therefore, the installation cost is 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7,344.

Next, add all these costs together to find the total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of the new carpet + Cost of padding + Installation cost
- Total cost = $864 + $2,592 + $432 + $7,344 = $11,232

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet is $11,232.

The answer is {11232}."
10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","To solve this problem, we'll first organize the information about how many apples each sister gathers from each type of tree.

1. **Joanne's Gathering:**
   - Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
   - Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30/2 = 15 apples.
   - Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, which we will call ""A"".

2. **Sister's Gathering:**
   - Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
   - Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
   - Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

3. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

Now, we can write an equation based on the total number of apples:

- Total apples gathered = (Joanne's apples from tallest + Joanne's apples from shortest + Joanne's apples from average) + (Sister's apples from tallest + Sister's apples from shortest).

Substituting the respective values, we have:

\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500. \]

Now, combine the known values:

\[ 150 + A = 500. \]

Solve for A:

\[ A = 500 - 150. \]

\[ A = 350. \]

Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","To determine how many plants Pat needs to buy, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed and account for the spacing between them.

1. **Calculate the total space needed for each plant and its spacing:**
   - Each plant is 12 inches wide. Converting this to feet gives 12 inches / 12 inches per foot = 1 foot.
   - The space between plants is 1.5 feet.
   - Therefore, the total width used per plant including spacing is 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

2. **Calculate how many sets of plant-plus-spacing units can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of 2.5-foot wide sections that fit in 111 feet is 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4.
   - Since a partial plant doesn't make sense in this context, we round down to 44 complete plants.

3. **Account for the plants Pat already owns:**
   - Pat already has 17 plants.
   - Therefore, the number of additional plants Pat needs to purchase is 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - So the total cost for 27 plants is 27 plants * $6 per plant = $162.

The amount Pat will spend at the store is $162.

12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"To calculate how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to determine the total time he spent on his vacation activities. He spent 30% of his time on other activities, which included:

- 6 hours boating
- 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours swimming
- 3 shows x 2 hours each = 6 hours on shows

The total amount of time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours.

These 15 hours represent 30% of his total vacation time, therefore, his entire vacation time can be calculated using the proportion:

Let T be the total vacation time:
0.30 * T = 15 hours
T = 15 / 0.30
T = 50 hours

John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Thus, the time spent sightseeing is:

0.40 * 50 = 20 hours

13,"Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. These are his only expenses. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?","To calculate Kim's profit, we first need to determine his total expenses and then subtract them from his total income.

Kim currently has 3 clients and expects to have an additional 5 potential clients, totaling 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client's home requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloth. Therefore, for 8 clients:

- Bottles of bleach required: 8 clients * 2 bottles = 16 bottles.
- Packs of cloths required: 8 clients * 1 pack = 8 packs.

The cost per bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost per pack of cloths is $5:

- Total cost for bleach: 16 bottles * $2 = $32
- Total cost for cloths: 8 packs * $5 = $40

Thus, Kim's total weekly expenses are $32 (for bleach) + $40 (for cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92.

Therefore, Kim's profit is calculated as:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses = $92 - $72 = $20.

14,"Lisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them, because on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. How many people sang in the performance?","Answer: The choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls. Therefore, there are 52 * 0.5 = 26 girls in the choir. On the day of the performance, half of the girls decided to perform but their bus breaks down, so only half of the original 26 girls were able to make it. 

This means that 26 / 2 = 13 girls are able to perform. Additionally, the 3 teachers decide to sing with the choir. Hence, the total number of people singing in the performance is 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","The initial length of the piece of chalk is 5 inches. By the end of Monday, the teacher had used 45% of the chalk. 

To calculate how much chalk was used on Monday:
\[ 
0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches} 
\]

The remaining chalk after Monday is:
\[ 
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} 
\]

The teacher will recycle the chalk when it becomes smaller than 2 inches. Hence, the chalk can be used until it reaches exactly 2 inches.

So, the amount of chalk that can still be used is:
\[ 
2.75 - 2 = 0.75 \text{ inches} 
\]

Under normal conditions, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. Therefore, the amount of chalk used per day is:
\[ 
0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ inch} 
\]

On the subsequent days, since only 0.75 inches is usable, we need to determine how many days it takes to use up this amount when 1 inch is used per day. 

Since the teacher uses 1 inch per day normally, but only has 0.75 inches left to use, he will be able to use it up within:
\[ 
\text{Days} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \text{ days} 
\]

Since he can't use a fraction of a day to finish the remaining chalk within his constraint of stopping at 2 inches, he can essentially use the remainder of one more day under usual conditions before recycling the chalk.

So he has only the upcoming day as a whole day, which rounds off to just 0 full days before he must recycle the chalk. Therefore, he can use it for only the fractional portion of the next day, practically meaning 0 additional full days given normal use.

16,"Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?","To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then convert that volume to gallons. Finally, we'll multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool:  
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:  
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

For the Smith family's pool:  
\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, convert this volume into gallons using the pool company's conversion factor:  
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Finally, calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon:  
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times \$0.10 \, \text{per gallon} = \$826 \]

The total cost to fill the pool is $826.  

So, the answer is: \[\{826\}\]"
17,"Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","To determine who runs farther, let's calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Kelly:**

1. **Initial back and forth:** 
   Kelly starts by running the entire 100 yards down the field and back, totaling 2 * 100 = 200 yards.

2. **40-yard line shuttle runs:**
   Each run to the 40-yard line and back is 40 yards there and 40 yards back, totaling 80 yards per shuttle run.
   She does this 34 times, so she runs 34 * 80 = 2720 yards for the shuttle runs.

3. **Total distance for Kelly:** 
   200 yards (initial back and forth) + 2720 yards (shuttle runs) = 2920 yards.

**Blake:**

Blake runs the entire 100-yard length of the field back and forth. Each full trip is 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
Blake does this 15 times, so he runs 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

**Determine the difference:**

Blake runs 3000 yards, while Kelly runs 2920 yards.

The difference in distance traveled is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards. 

Blake runs farther than Kelly by 80 yards.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"To calculate the cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total wall area to be painted. The room has four walls, and their dimensions are as follows:

- North and South walls: 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall, each.
- East and West walls: 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall, each.

Let's compute the total area of each pair of walls:

1. **North and South Walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet.
   - Two walls mean a total area of 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

2. **East and West Walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet.
   - Two walls mean a total area of 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Next, we calculate the number of gallons of paint needed. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, to determine the cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost to paint the room is $144.

The answer is {144}."
20,"On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","To solve this problem, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests at the hotel due to checkouts and check-ins.

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.

2. 24 guests opted for an early checkout, so the number of guests after early checkout is:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.

3. 15 guests opted for a late checkout, so after these guests check out, the hotel has:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.

4. In the afternoon, twice as many guests checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

5. Adding the afternoon check-ins to the current number of guests, we have:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.

6. 7 more guests checked in after dinner, so the final count of guests after dinner is:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

Thus, after dinner, the hotel has 98 guests.

The answer is {98}."
21,"Brendan has a bag of marbles with 10 inside. He tripped over a pebble while carrying it and dropped half of them. One of them he picked up wasn't a marble, but actually a bead so he got rid of it. He only picked up 3 in total. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?","Brendan started with 10 marbles in his bag. After tripping over a pebble, he dropped half of his marbles. Half of 10 is 5, so he dropped 5 marbles.

He was able to pick up 3 marbles in total, one of which turned out to be a bead, so he discarded this bead. Therefore, the number of actual marbles he picked up is 3 - 1 = 2 marbles.

After this event, Brendan went home with the remaining marbles in his bag, which is the initial 10 marbles minus the 5 he dropped, plus the 2 he managed to pick again. 

So, Brendan ended up with 10 - 5 + 2 = 7 marbles.

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","To figure out how much of a daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn. Since 1 pound of weight loss requires a 3500 calorie deficit, losing 30 lbs would require a 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calorie deficit.

Next, we need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th. Hereโs a breakdown of those days:

- January 1st to January 31st: 31 days
- February (assuming it's not a leap year): 28 days
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these together, we find that there are 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Now, we divide the total calorie deficit needed (105,000 calories) by the number of days (200 days) to get the daily calorie deficit:

105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by his birthday.

23,"Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?","To find out how much Artie will make after rounding the prices to the nearest dollar and selling the pots of flowers, we need to do the following:

1. **Round the prices of each type of flower pot to the nearest dollar:**
   - Marigolds are $2.74 per pot. Round $2.74 to the nearest whole dollar: $2.74 rounds to $3.
   - Petunias are $1.87 per pot. Round $1.87 to the nearest whole dollar: $1.87 rounds to $2.
   - Begonias are $2.12 per pot. Round $2.12 to the nearest whole dollar: $2.12 rounds to $2.

2. **Calculate the total revenue for each type of flower based on the rounded prices:**
   - Marigolds: Sell 12 pots at the rounded price of $3 each: 12 pots * $3 = $36.
   - Petunias: Sell 9 pots at the rounded price of $2 each: 9 pots * $2 = $18.
   - Begonias: Sell 17 pots at the rounded price of $2 each: 17 pots * $2 = $34.

3. **Add up the revenue from all the flower sales:**
   - Total revenue = $36 (for marigolds) + $18 (for petunias) + $34 (for begonias) = $88.

Therefore, Artie will make a total of $88 from selling his flowers at the rounded prices.

After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag. Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?","To find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried and then sum them all up.

1. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls.

2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Therefore, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

3. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Therefore, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

To find the total number of balls, we add the number of balls each person carried:

- Jordan: 4 balls
- Jason: 2 balls
- Jeffrey: 1 ball

Total number of balls = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought a total of 7 balls to practice.

On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?","To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day over the week, we first need to find the total number of birds he observed during the week.

Let's go day by day:

- Day 1 and Day 2: Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- Day 3: Mack saw 0 birds.
- Day 4: Mack saw 120 birds.
- Day 5:  Mack saw 120 birds.
- Day 6: Mack saw 20 birds.
- Day 7: Mack saw 90 birds.

Now we will sum up all the birds Mack saw during these seven days:

Total birds = 50 (Days 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4) + 120 (Day 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 400 birds.

To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7):

Average = Total birds / Number of days = 400 birds / 7 days โ 57.14 birds.

Therefore, on average, Mack saw approximately 57.14 birds each day.

He ordered 100 more after he started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?","First, let's determine the total number of butterscotch candies Dale initially ordered. He started with an order of 100 candies and then ordered an additional 100 candies. Therefore, the total initial order was:

100 (original) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies.

Next, we know that Dale ended up selling 150 candies. Therefore, to find out how many more he needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

Thus, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, let's break down the information given:

1. Total earnings for the week = $105
2. Felix charges $0.25 per branch

To find out how many branches Felix climbed in total over the week, we divide his total earnings by the cost per branch: 
\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Charge per Branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

The problem is to find the average number of branches climbed per day. Assuming a 7-day week, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days:
\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{7} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","To solve this problem, let's break it down into each interval and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each step.

1. **First 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate: 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds (30 to 60 seconds)**: 
   - Popping rate increases to three times the initial 30-second rate.
   - 3 * 20 kernels = 60 kernels pop.

3. **Following 30 seconds (60 to 90 seconds)**: 
   - Popping rate increases to four times the initial rate.
   - 4 * 20 kernels (initial popping rate per 30 seconds) = 80 kernels pop.

4. **Final 30 seconds (90 to 120 seconds)**:
   - Popping rate is half of the previous 30-second rate (from 60 to 90 seconds).
   - Half of 80 kernels (previous 30 seconds rate) = 40 kernels pop.

5. **Residual popping after removing from heat**:
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop.
   - 1/4 of 40 kernels = 10 kernels pop.

Now, sum up all the popped kernels:
- 20 (first 30 seconds) 
- 60 (next 30 seconds)
- 80 (following 30 seconds)
- 40 (final 30 seconds)
- 10 (residual popping)

Total number of popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

30,"An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","To solve this problem, we'll break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the cost of each item:**

   - **Cost of a Pepper:** We know from the problem statement that each pepper costs $15.

   - **Cost of a Watermelon:** Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

   - **Cost of an Orange:** An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

2. **Calculate the total cost for each item:**

   - **Total Cost for Watermelons:** Dillon is buying 4 watermelons. The total cost for the watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

   - **Total Cost for Peppers:** Dillon is buying 20 peppers. The total cost for the peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

   - **Total Cost for Oranges:** Dillon is buying 10 oranges. The total cost for the oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:**

   - Add up the total costs for the watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880.

When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times the alarm rang each time it went off and sum them up.

First Alarm:
- The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

Second Alarm:
- It rang three times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 times * 3 = 12 times.

Third Alarm:
- It rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?,"Jim starts with a 20 pack of gum. 

During the school day, Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum. 

He chews an additional 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. That totals 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

Before bed, Jim gives half of his remaining gum to his sister. Before giving any gum to his sister, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left. 

Jim gives away half of the 14 pieces he has, which is 14/2 = 7 pieces. 

Thus, Jim ends the day with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum remaining.

Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed he buys.

1. Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes:
   - Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
   
2. Calculate the total weight of oats:
   - Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.
   
3. Calculate the total weight of hay:
   - Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
   
4. Calculate the total weight of carrots:
   - Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
   
Next, sum up the weights of all the feed:

Total weight = Sugar cubes + Oats + Hay + Carrots  
Total weight = 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48  
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, given that his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. 

Divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?,"To calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used throughout the week, we can break it down by meal type:

1. **Sandwiches:**  
Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.  
There are 7 days in a week, so:  
2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches

36,"Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the first race, he lost $5. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","Answer:

To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average, we first need to calculate his net gain/loss for each race and then find the average.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. 
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.
   - Thus, he won \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) dollars in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - So, he lost \( 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \) dollars in the third race.

Now let's calculate the total net loss:

- First race: -5 dollars.
- Second race: +11 dollars.
- Third race: -16.5 dollars.

The total net loss over the three races is:

\[ -5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the average loss, we divide the total net loss by the number of races:

\[ \text{Average loss} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5 \]

Therefore, he lost an average of $3.50 per race.

10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500.  

Next, calculate the cost of the dress pants:  

Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.    

Therefore, each dress pant costs $750 / 5 = $150.  

10 dress pants * $150 = $1,500.  

Next, calculate the cost of the dress shirts:  

James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, for a total of 10 suits. So, he buys 3 shirts/suit * 10 suits = 30 dress shirts.  

30 shirts * $60 per shirt = $1,800.  

Now, add all the costs together:  

$7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts) = $10,800.  

Therefore, the total cost of everything is {$10,800}."

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters each} \]

Finally, Jack's friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long per quarter as Jack, meaning they can play for 30 minutes per quarter. So, to play for 240 minutes, they will need:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \]

Calculating the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- The two friends who are worse need 24 quarters each, totaling \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) quarters
- The one friend who is better needs 8 quarters

The total number of quarters used:
\[ 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \]

Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total cost is:
\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \times \text{\$0.25/quarter} = \$17 \]

The answer is {17}."
41,Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"To determine how much Mike needs to spend to replace his entire movie collection with digital versions, we break it down into different categories of his 600 movies: series, older movies, and normal movies. 

1. **Movies in Series:**
   - A third of the movies are in series, so there are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies in series.
   - The cost to replace these series movies is 60% of the normal movie price, so each series movie costs \( 0.6 \times 10 = 6 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost to replace the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \).

2. **Older Movies:**
   - There are 600 total movies, with 200 being in series. This leaves \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies that are not in series.
   - 40% of these are older movies, so there are \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) older movies.
   - Each older movie costs $5 to replace, so the total cost for older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \).

3. **Normal Movies:**
   - The rest of the movies that are not in series and are not older movies are normal movies.
   - The number of normal movies is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).
   - Each normal movie costs $10, so the total cost for normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \).

Adding these amounts gives us the total cost of replacing all the movies:
- Cost for series movies: $1200
- Cost for older movies: $800
- Cost for normal movies: $2400

Thus, the total cost to replace all of Mike's movies is \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \).

42,Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. He is now 34. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?,"To determine how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he's taken since he started at the age of 23 until his current age of 34.

1. **Determine the years of vacationing:**  
   Gene started vacationing at age 23 and is now 34. Thus, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations:**  
   Gene goes on 4 vacations per year. So, over 11 years, he has taken a total of 11 * 4 = 44 vacations.

3. **Determine the number of quilt blocks:**  
   Since each vacation corresponds to one shirt and each shirt makes one quilt block, Gene has 44 quilt blocks.

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks for his quilt.

The answer is {44}."
43,Walter is collecting money for charity. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. First Walter collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?,"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first need to find the total amount of money collected by Walter from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend.

1. Money collected from neighbors: $500
2. Money collected from the online fund: $1500
3. Money collected from his friend: $200

Total amount collected by Walter before informing his lawyer:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

According to the problem, Walter's lawyer will donate three times the amount that everyone else has already donated. Therefore, the lawyer will donate:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

The answer is \{6600\}."
44,"Students who are football players, cheerleaders or part of band in Mr. Roper's class will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  How many students are leaving early?","To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to first determine how many students are football players, as well as how many students from the remaining group are cheerleaders or part of the band.

1. Calculate the number of football players:
   - 20% of the class are football players.
   - Therefore, the number of football players = 30 students * 20% = 30 * 0.20 = 6 students.

2. Determine the number of remaining students:
   - After accounting for the football players, the remaining number of students = 30 students - 6 football players = 24 students.

3. Calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members:
   - 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band.
   - Therefore, the number of cheerleaders or band members = 24 students * 25% = 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.

4. Total number of students leaving early:
   - The total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders or band members, which is 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students.

45,"Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over two days and determine how many gallons remain for the tank to be full.

**First Day:**

1. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. 
   - Tank capacity = 18,000 gallons.
   - Water pumped by Wanda = (1/4) ร 18,000 = 4,500 gallons.

2. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did.
   - Ms. B's water = (3/4) ร 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

**Second Day:**

1. Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda = (2/3) ร 4,500 = 3,000 gallons.

2. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Ms. B's water = (1/3) ร 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped:**

Add up all the water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:

- Total water by Wanda (over both days) = 4,500 + 3,000 = 7,500 gallons.
- Total water by Ms. B (over both days) = 3,375 + 1,125 = 4,500 gallons.

Total gallons pumped into the tank = 7,500 + 4,500 = 12,000 gallons.

**Gallons Remaining:**

Since the tank's full capacity is 18,000 gallons, the remaining gallons to be filled are:

- Remaining gallons = 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.

The answer is {6000}."
46,"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. The crown costs an extra $500. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. He's already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?","Answer:  

To determine how much George needs to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of the Implants**:  
   - Each implant costs $2000.  
   - He needs 2 implants, so the total base cost for the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

2. **Cost of the Crowns**:  
   - The crown for one implant costs $500.
   - Since he needs 2, we'll assume both crowns cost the same unless stated otherwise. Therefore, the cost for the crowns is 2 * $500 = $1000.

Given these costs:  
- **Total cost before the deposit**: $4000 (implants) + $1000 (crowns) = $5000.

3. **Subtract the Deposit**:
   - He has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount needed is $5000 - $600 = $4400.

4. **Calculate Work Hours**:
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $4400: 
     \[
     \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total cost remaining}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{4400}{15} = \text{approximately} \ 293.33
     \]

Since George can't work a fraction of an hour, he needs to work 294 hours to have enough to pay for the dental work.

The answer is {294}."
47,"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?","Answer: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. During the second week, he produces half of that amount, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, Boris produces three times what he produced in the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars. Let's calculate what's currently produced across the first three weeks:

- Week 1 Production: 8,000 bars
- Week 2 Production: 4,000 bars
- Week 3 Production: 24,000 bars
  
The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, so the amount left for the fourth week is:

Total monthly production - Production so far = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

The answer is {14,000}."
48,"Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?","To solve the problem of how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia ended up with a total of 12 spoons to set the table.

2. Three spoons were used by Julia to sample the stew, so these spoons were initially included in her total before setting the table.

3. This tells us that before using any spoons, she initially had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.

4. Julia's husband bought a separate package of 5 spoons and gave them to her, contributing to the total.

5. Therefore, the remaining number of spoons that must have come from the package Julia bought is 15 - 5 = 10 spoons.

So, the package that Julia bought contains 10 spoons.

49,"A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \). 

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. We are told that 6 jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on. Therefore, 
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = 6
   \]

3. Solving the equation \(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = 6 \):
   \[
   \frac{J}{15} = 6
   \]

4. Multiply both sides by 15 to solve for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The answer is {90}."
50,"Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, let's carefully track the depletion of the charge over time:

1. **After 5 hours**: The power bank loses 9% per hour for the first 5 hours. Therefore, the total percentage lost during this period is \( 9\% \times 5 = 45\% \).

2. **Charge after 5 hours**: Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park. After 5 hours, the remaining charge would be \( x - 45\% \).

3. **After the next 3 hours**: The power bank then loses 7% per hour for the next 3 hours. The total percentage lost during this period is \( 7\% \times 3 = 21\% \).

4. **Total percentage lost over the entire 8 hours**: The power bank has lost a total of \( 45\% + 21\% = 66\% \).

5. **Ending charge**: We know from the problem statement that the remaining charge was 28%. Therefore, the equation for the total charge lost is:  
   \[
   x - 66\% = 28\%
   \]
   This means that \( x - 66 = 28 \).

6. **Solving the equation for x**:  
   \[
   x = 28\% + 66\% = 94\%
   \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The answer is \({94}\)."

Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each group of flowers Rose picked and adjust for those that were dropped.

1. **First set of flowers:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
   
2. **Second set of flowers:**
   - Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
   
3. **Third set of flowers:**
   - Rose picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

4. **Dropped flowers from the first three sets:**
   - She drops 1 flower from each of the first three sets, totaling 3 dropped flowers.
     - Dropped 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, and 1 flower with 4 petals.

52,"A charity group decides to do a yard sale.  10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each.  They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table.  They also have 10 boxes of stuff already.  If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?","Each person donates 5 boxes of stuff, and 10 people are donating. Therefore, they receive 5 boxes/person * 10 people = 50 boxes of donated stuff. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already.

Altogether, they have 50 (donated boxes) + 10 (existing boxes) = 60 boxes of stuff.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, they will need 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables in total to accommodate all the boxes.

They already own 15 tables. Thus, they need 30 total tables - 15 existing tables = 15 new tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs to acquire 15 new tables for their yard sale.

Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","To find out how many seashells each person got, we first need to determine how many seashells each person collected.

1. **Determining Carlos's Seashells:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
   - Thus, Carlos collected \( C = 27 - 5 = 22 \) seashells.

2. **Determining Carrey's Seashells:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Let \( X \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
   - So, \( 2X = 22 \).
   - Solving for \( X \), we get \( X = 22/2 = 11 \) seashells.

3. **Calculating the Total and How Many Each Got:**
   - Total seashells collected by the three are:
     - Carlos: 22 seashells
     - Jim: 27 seashells
     - Carrey: 11 seashells
   - Total seashells = \( 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \) seashells.
   - Since they divided the seashells equally among the three of them, each person received \( 60/3 = 20 \) seashells.

So, each person got 20 seashells.

Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?","Debra observed the bees over three 6-hour periods, making a total of 18 hours.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Half of the 30 bees return, which means 30/2 = 15 bees return.

3. **Last 6 hours:**
   - By the end of the next period, all bees that haven't returned yet do so. Therefore, the remaining 30 - 15 = 15 bees return.
   - During the same last 6 hours, two times the number of bees that initially left (30) fly out. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave during this period.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra sees return in the last 6 hours is 15 (the remaining bees from the first 30 that returned).

55,"Buford writes many checks every year.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?","To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the various recurring payments he makes.

1. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for his gas bill once every month. Therefore, he writes 12 checks per year for the gas bill (1 check per month * 12 months).

2. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly for this service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service (1 check per quarter * 4 quarters).

3. **Electric Bill**: Similarly to the gas bill, Buford writes a check for the electric bill once every month, resulting in 12 checks per year for the electric bill (1 check per month * 12 months).

4. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. Therefore, he writes 24 checks per year for the church (2 checks per month * 12 months).

Now, we add up all the checks:

- Gas Bill: 12 checks
- Pest and Lawn Service: 4 checks
- Electric Bill: 12 checks

If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate and subtract all associated costs and loan amounts from the selling price.

1. **Selling Price**: Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.

2. **Transfer Fees**: These amount to 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee**: This is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: Mr. Tan paid off a loan amount of $250,000.

Next, we calculate the total costs Mr. Tan incurred:

- Total Costs = Transfer Fees + Brokerage Fee + Remaining Loan Amount
- Total Costs = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, to get the net proceeds, we subtract the total costs from the selling price:

- Net Proceeds = Selling Price - Total Costs

And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long each wolf howls and then convert the total time to minutes.

1. **Determine Tobias's Howling Time:**
   - Each of Tobias's howls lasts 20 seconds.

2. **Determine Chikote's Howling Time:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. If Tobias howls for \( x \) seconds, then Chikote howls for \( 2x \) seconds.

3. **Determine Igneous's Howling Time:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. Therefore, Igneous's howling time is \( x + 2x = 3x \) seconds.

4. **Combined Howling Time for All Three Wolves:**
   - Sum of times for the three wolves is: 
   \[
   x + 2x + 3x = 6x
   \]
   seconds.

To find the total time in minutes, we first need to know the total howling time in seconds for Tobias. Assuming Tobias howls 1 time (20 seconds), and we have \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \) seconds for Tobias's total howling cycle.

5. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - The total combined time of 120 seconds needs to be converted to minutes. 
   - \( 120 \) seconds \( = 120/60 = 2 \) minutes.

6. **General Total Time for 6x:**
   Since Tobias's total howling time is actually contingent on how often he howls or if there are quantifiable cycles, as reasoned above \( 6 \times 20 \) is hypothetical in linking a single bout (cycle) from Tobias:

Thus:

The total combined time for the wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

58,"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","First, let's calculate the cost of the shirt after the discount. The shirt is originally priced at $25, and there's a 30% off sale. A 30% discount on the shirt means he will save 30/100 * 25 = $7.50. Therefore, the cost of the shirt after the discount is 25 - 7.50 = $17.50.

Next, let's find the total cost of both items. The pair of shorts is $35, and the shirt after the discount is $17.50. The total cost Joe will need to pay is 35 + 17.50 = $52.50.

Finally, we need to determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. Joe has $50 initially. Therefore, Joe will pay $52.50 for the outfit. However, since the total cost exceeds his budget of $50, Joe will not have enough money to make this purchase, indicating an error in the context or additional details might be needed such as the discount applying to both items or additional funds from another source.

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","Answer:  

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The initial cost was:  
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400  

She got $2 off with her voucher, so the final price she paid was:  
$400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, the price per pomegranate increased to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates, which without any discounts would have cost:  
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600  

Sheila received a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount was:  
10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60  

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid was:  
$600 - $60 = $540  

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:  
$540 - $398 = $142  

The answer is {142}."
60,"Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, let's determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then figure out the total books any single bookcase can accommodate.

1. **Middle Shelves:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - Since there are 2 middle shelves, they hold 10 books * 2 shelves = 20 books in total.

2. **Bottom Shelf:**
   - The bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - So, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

3. **Top Shelf:**
   - The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - So, the top shelf holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

4. **Total Books per Bookcase:**
   - The total number of books one bookcase can hold is:
     - Middle shelves: 20 books
     - Bottom shelf: 20 books
     - Top shelf: 15 books
   - Total = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

5. **Total Number of Bookcases Needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books total.
   - If one bookcase holds 55 books, then the number of bookcases needed is:
     - 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.

Thus, Elly will need 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

61,"When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","To determine how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to first calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls. 

Sophie has:
- 9 stacking rings
- 31 building blocks
- 8 stuffed animals

Adding these together, we find the total number of toys before the bouncy balls were added:

9 stacking rings + 31 building blocks + 8 stuffed animals = 48 toys

Sophie mentioned that the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls is 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube can be calculated by subtracting the initial total of toys from the new total:

62 total toys - 48 toys (before bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls

The answer is {14}."
62,Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce. John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  How many calories is the omelet?,"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs**:   
John uses 6 eggs in his omelet. Since each egg has 75 calories, the calories from eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories per egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

2. **Cheese**:  
John uses 2 ounces of cheese. Each ounce of cheese contains 120 calories, so the calories from cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories per oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

3. **Ham**:  
John uses 2 ounces of ham, since it is the same amount as the cheese. Each ounce of ham contains 40 calories, so the calories from ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories per oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories for the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories (eggs)} + 240 \text{ calories (cheese)} + 80 \text{ calories (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in John's omelet is 770.

63,"Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. After she returned an item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  The returned item cost $15.00. What is the new balance on her credit card?","To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must adjust her original balance based on the purchase of the frying pan and the set of towels, while accounting for the returned item.

1. **Initial Charge:**  
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. **Returned Item:**  
   Sheila returned an item that cost $15.00. Therefore, the return reduces her balance by $15.00.  
   Adjusted balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**  
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off. The original price was $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is:  
   \(20\) * \(0.20\) = \( \$4.00 \).  
   The sale price of the frying pan is:  
   \$20.00 - \$4.00 = \$16.00.

4. **Towels Purchase:**  
   The set of towels was 10% off of $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is:  
   \(30\) * \(0.10\) = \( \$3.00 \).  
   The sale price of the towels is:  
   \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00.

5. **Total for Frying Pan and Towels:**  
   The combined cost of the frying pan and the towels is:  
   \$16.00 + \$27.00 = \$43.00.

6. **New Balance Calculation:**  
   Add the cost of the new purchases to the adjusted balance after the return:  
   \$70.00 (adjusted balance) + \$43.00 (new purchases) = \$113.00. 

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is {113.00}."
64,Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day. The plane tickets cost $5000 each. If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?,"The normal price for the hotel per day is $1500. However, due to the busy weekend, the hotel charges an additional 20%. To calculate the increased cost, we find 20% of $1500, which is:

20% of $1500 = 0.20 * $1500 = $300

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:

$1500 + $300 = $1800

Tom and his wife stay for 3 days, so the total cost of the hotel is:

$1800 * 3 days = $5400

The plane tickets cost $5000 each. Since there are two people (Tom and his wife), the total cost of the plane tickets is:

$5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, adding the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets gives us the total cost of the trip:

$5400 (hotel) + $10,000 (plane tickets) = $15,400

The answer is {15400}."

He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?","To find out how much Mark makes in a week, let's break down the information given and calculate his earnings:

1. **Total Sentences Edited**: Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, split equally between two publishers: Publisher A and Publisher B.

2. **Sentences Per Publisher**: Since he edits an equal number for both publishers, he edits 1000 sentences / 2 publishers = 500 sentences per publisher.

3. **Payment by Publisher A**: Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns 5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

4. **Payment Rate for Publisher B**: Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. So, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

5. **Payment by Publisher B**: For 500 sentences, Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents.

6. **Total Earnings in a Week**: To find out the total amount Mark makes in a week, add his earnings from both publishers. Total earnings = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","First, let's calculate the total cost for one person, including Morgan herself, to enjoy all the activities at the birthday party. 

1. The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
2. The cost for $5 in arcade tokens is simply $5.
3. Each go-kart ride costs $10, so if each person rides twice, that will be 2 rides * $10 per ride = $20 for go-karts.

Now let's add up the total cost per person:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $20

Total cost per person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan has a budget of $90 for the birthday party. Since this budget includes herself, let's see how many people (including Morgan) can participate if the cost is $30 per person. 

$90 total budget / $30 cost per person = 3 people

Since Morgan is one of these three people, she can invite 3 - 1 = 2 friends to the party while staying within the budget.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

67,"Each team member brings 2 guests. Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?","First, let's calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game.

1. Team members: There are 12 team members.
2. Team members' guests: Each team member brings 2 guests, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
3. Coaches: There are 3 coaches.

Adding these up, we get the total number of people:
12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people.

Next, we need to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can calculate the number of pizzas required as follows:

Total people รท Serving per pizza = 39 รท 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost to buy the pizzas. Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195.

Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?","To find the total cost of the property, we first need to determine the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add these to the house's selling price.

First, calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price:

\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, add the original selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to get the total cost of the house:

\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, compare the total price of the house with Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000 to find the difference:

Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.","To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and then calculate the total time spent writing those articles.

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 

   To find the number of articles written on Tuesday:
   - Calculate 2/5 of the articles written on Monday: (2/5) * 5 = 2 extra articles.
   - So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 (Monday's articles) + 2 (extra) = 7 articles.

3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.

   - Calculate twice the articles written on Tuesday: 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

4. Total number of articles written over the three days:

How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","To determine how many points the class is missing to reach the minimum threshold, we need to find out how many points each student has collected and then add them together.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Betty's Points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}

71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","To determine how many white fish Bob bought at the pet store, we need to evaluate the total number of fish in his pond after adding the new fish from the store.

Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying 17 more fish from the pet store and adding them to his pond, the total number of fish in his pond increased to \(7 + 17 = 24\) fish.

We know from the problem statement that after adding the fish from the store, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish in his pond.

Let \( w \) represent the number of white fish Bob bought at the store. Then, the number of white fish in his pond becomes \( 4 + w \).

The number of orange fish he bought would be \( 17 - w \), since all fish from the store were either white or orange.

Therefore, the total number of orange fish in his pond becomes \( 3 + (17 - w) = 20 - w \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so:

\[ 20 - w = 2(4 + w) \]

This equation can be solved as follows:

\[ 20 - w = 8 + 2w \]

\[ 20 - 8 = 2w + w \]

\[ 12 = 3w \]

\[ w = 4 \]

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys were produced in total and then find out how many toys the fifth worker made.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys that were supposed to be made. The order is for 400 toys, but by the end of the shift, 20 toys were still needed. This means the workers managed to produce 400 - 20 = 380 toys during the shift.

Next, calculate how many toys the four known workers produced:

1. Two workers produce 6 toys an hour. Over a 10-hour shift, these two workers together produce:
   - 2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

2. Another two workers produce 4 toys an hour. Over a 10-hour shift, these two workers together produce:
   - 2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

Adding these up, the four known workers collectively produced 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the workers produced a total of 380 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the rest. Therefore, the fifth worker produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Finally, to determine the production rate of the fifth worker:
   - 180 toys in a 10-hour shift results in:
   - 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"To find how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then calculate how many of those jelly beans are red.

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Jar**:
   - The jar has a square base, so the base area is \(6 \text{ inches} \times 6 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ square inches}\).
   - The height of the jar is 15 inches.
   - The total volume of the jar is \(36 \text{ square inches} \times 15 \text{ inches} = 540 \text{ cubic inches}\).

2. **Calculate the Usable Volume for Jelly Beans**:
   - Packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's total volume can be used for jelly beans.
   - Usable volume = \(540 \text{ cubic inches} \times 0.8 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}\).

3. **Estimate the Total Number of Jelly Beans**:
   - Each jelly bean occupies \(0.15 \text{ cubic inches}\).
   - Total number of jelly beans = \(\frac{432 \text{ cubic inches}}{0.15 \text{ cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans}\).

4. **Estimate the Number of Red Jelly Beans**:
   - 30% of the jelly beans are estimated to be red.

Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?","To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, let's first find the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.

We know the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and 200 pink calla lilies were ordered:

Let \( x \) be the number of white carnations. 

Then, \( 5x = 200 \), so:

\[ x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

This means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so:

The number of red roses = 4 times the number of white carnations:

\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball subs.

Each meatball sub contains 4 meatballs, so initially, there were 7 subs * 4 meatballs per sub = 28 meatballs in total.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Thus, he consumed 4 subs * 4 meatballs per sub = 16 meatballs.

79,John drives to his friend's house. He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. The friend's house is 200 miles away. How long did the trip take?,"To determine the total time taken for John's trip, we need to consider both the detour on the way to his friend's house and the direct route on the way back.

1. **Trip to Friend's House:**
   - Original distance: 200 miles
   - Detour: +10 miles
   - Total distance to friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles
   - Speed on this route: 70 mph

   Time taken to reach friend's house = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Trip Back Home:**
   - Distance on the return trip: 240 miles
   - Speed on this route: 80 mph

   Time taken for the return trip = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

3. **Total Trip Time:**
   - Time to friend's house: 3 hours
   - Time back home: 3 hours

   Therefore, total time for the round trip is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

80,"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","To determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original prices of each type of jeans before the sale.

1. **Price of the tattered jeans:**

   The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Price of the jogger jeans:**

   The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans:
   \[
   \text{Jogger jeans original price} = 28 - 6 = 22
   \]

3. **Total savings:**

   Cole saved a total of $6 on both jeans. 

4. **Distribution of savings:**

   Cole saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the remaining \(\frac{2}{3}\) from the tattered jeans.

   Total savings from jogger jeans:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
   \]

   Total savings from tattered jeans:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]

5. **Original vs. Sale prices:**

   If Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, their sale price was:
   \[
   22 - 2 = 20
   \]

   There is no additional information about how much the jogger jeans cost originally beyond the calculated original and sale prices. 

Based on the given information, there's no statement that jogger jeans originally cost more than tattered jeans; in fact, the cost setup shows they were cheaper initially. Therefore, the part of the question querying the additional cost of jogger jeans than tattered jeans might have been set incorrectly due to an assumption or typographical error, considering all computations are consistent, and under typical transaction circumstances, goods initially bear their scalar relation (joggers cheaper by $6 compared to tattered ones).

The focal question of comparative price exceeds the delivered scenario meaning. Hence, the answer must reflect the clarification requirement perspective not engaged by earlier premise answering an implicit query effectively nonexistent under retrospective examination here.

Given the typographic error and conceptual necessity for adherence:
Answer: {Jogger jeans were cheaper by $6, not more expensive, than tattered jeans before any sale adjustment took place.}"
81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","Answer: 

First, determine the amount of the loan John received by mortgaging his home. Since the loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, the calculation is:

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000  
Loan amount = 0.40 * $250,000  
Loan amount = $100,000  

John uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. Calculate the amount used to pay debts:

Amount used for debts = 60% of $100,000  
Amount used for debts = 0.60 * $100,000  
Amount used for debts = $60,000  

Now, subtract the amount used for debts from the total loan to find out how much money John had leftover:

Leftover money = Loan amount - Amount used for debts  
Leftover money = $100,000 - $60,000  
Leftover money = $40,000

The answer is {40,000}."
82,"An air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","To determine how many degrees lower the final temperature is compared to the starting temperature, we'll consider the changes in temperature during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Therefore, for 3 hours on low, it cools the room by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Thus, for 4 hours on high, it cools the room by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is turned off.
   - Therefore, for 2 hours off, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, we calculate the net effect on the room's temperature:

- Initial cooling during the low period: -6 degrees
- Further cooling during the high period: -12 degrees
- Warming during the off period: +4 degrees

Combining these changes, the net change in temperature is:

\(-6 - 12 + 4 = -14\) degrees

Thus, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The answer is {14}."
83,"Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.   He knows that for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars. He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus. Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?","To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can use the given average conversion rates. 

1. **Determine the number of customers needed:**
   Jason sells a car to every two customers that visit the dealership. Therefore, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed:**
   For every 25 telephone calls Jason makes, 1 person comes into the dealership. So, to bring 30 customers into the dealership, he needs to make 25 * 30 = 750 telephone calls.

Thus, based on these averages, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The answer is {750}."
84,"Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.  She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","To determine Millie's profit per hour, we first need to calculate the total revenue and total cost, and then determine how much she earns per hour for her efforts.

1. **Calculating Total Revenue**:  
   Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, each holding 12 cups, for a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups.  
   She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

2. **Calculating Total Cost**:  
   Millie spends $18 on supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

3. **Calculating Total Profit**:  
   Profit is calculated as Total Revenue - Total Cost.  
   So her total profit is $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18.

4. **Calculating Profit per Hour**:  
   Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.  
   Since she has a total of 36 cups, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

5. **Profit per Hour**:  
   If she makes a total profit of $18 over 9 hours, then her profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

85,"Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party. He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?","To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to consider both the main batch of lemonade and the extra gallon for Allen.

1. **Regular Lemonade Requirements:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade.
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. Therefore, 4 gallons require 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 4 gallons * 6 lemons per cup = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

2. **Extra Tart Lemonade Requirements:**
   - Allen's extra gallon needs to be twice as tart, which means it will require 2 cups of lemon juice instead of 1 cup.
   - Therefore, Allen's extra gallon will need 2 cups * 6 lemons per cup = 12 lemons.

3. **Total Lemon Requirement:**
   - For the 4 gallons of regular lemonade, Tim will need 24 lemons.
   - For the extra tart gallon, Tim will need 12 lemons.
   - Together, Tim needs a total of 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need a total of {36} lemons."
86,Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. The first friend says 80. What is their average guess?,"First, we need to determine the guesses made by each of Gunter's three friends.

1. **First Friend's Guess:**
   - According to the problem, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second Friend's Guess:**
   - The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - Half of the first friend's guess (80) is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \).
   - Adding 20 to this result, the second friend's guess is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).

3. **Third Friend's Guess:**
   - The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of the first friend's guess (80) is \( \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20 \).
   - Adding this amount to the first friend's guess, the third friend's guess is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Next, we calculate the average of these three guesses:

- First friend's guess = 80
- Second friend's guess = 60
- Third friend's guess = 100

The sum of their guesses is \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).

To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of guesses, which is 3:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

87,"A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?","To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, let's break down the sales by day:

1. **Friday:** The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:** The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, on Saturday, the store sold 2 * 14 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.

3. **Sunday:** On the last day, Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they sold on Saturday. Therefore, on Sunday, they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes. However, 6 pairs were returned because they didn't fit. Therefore, the effective sales on Sunday were 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of tennis shoes.

Now, calculate the total sales for the entire weekend:

- Total sales = Sales on Friday + Sales on Saturday + Effective Sales on Sunday
- Total sales = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of tennis shoes.

To determine how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate her monthly and then her yearly expenses for each category: treats, medicine, and food.

1. **Treats:**
   - Cost per month: $20
   - Cost per year: $20 * 12 = $240

2. **Medicine:**
   - Cost per month: $100
   - Cost per year: $100 * 12 = $1200

3. **Food:**
   - Cost per week: $25
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is $25 * 4 = $100
   - Cost per year: $100 * 12 = $1200

Now, we'll add up all the yearly costs:

Total yearly cost = Cost of treats per year + Cost of medicine per year + Cost of food per year  
Total yearly cost = $240 + $1200 + $1200 = $2640

The amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year is \(\boxed{2640}\)."
89,"Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's first determine the total amount of TV he watched on the other days.

- On Monday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode.
- On Tuesday, he watched another 1-hour episode.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. This totals to 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours.

Let's sum up the time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday = 1 hour
- Tuesday = 1 hour
- Thursday = 1.5 hours
- Friday = 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV for the week. Therefore, the difference on Wednesday, when he watched only 30-minute episodes, is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched is 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?,"To determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks being set off by the city and by Hannah.

First, calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:
- The city sets off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total city fireworks = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah's house is positioned such that she can only see 40% of the city's fireworks:
- Fireworks Hannah sees = 40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, calculate the total number of fireworks set off by Hannah:
- Hannah sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks set off by Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks.

Finally, add the number of fireworks Hannah sees from the city to the number she sets off herself:
- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 (city) + 15 (her backyard) = 135 fireworks.

She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","To determine how many skeins of wool Martha will need, we should calculate the total skeins required for each clothing item and then sum them up.

1. **Hat**: Each hat requires 2 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren:
   \[
   2 \text{ skeins/hat} \times 3 = 6 \text{ skeins}
   \]

2. **Scarf**: Each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren:
   \[
   4 \text{ skeins/scarf} \times 3 = 12 \text{ skeins}

93,"Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. Each student earns the same amount.  How much did each student raise?","To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine how much money the students collectively raised, and then divide that total by the number of students.

1. First, let's determine the amount raised by the students:
   - Total amount raised for the charity: $175,000.
   - Amount raised by organizations: $50,000.
   - Therefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

2. Now, we need to divide this amount equally among the 20 students:
   - Total amount raised by students: $125,000.
   - Number of students: 20.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  He lost 10 bills while getting home.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 dollar bills. 
   - The number of $20 bills he gets is $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills.

2. Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 50 bills is 50 / 2 = 25 bills.
   - Hence, he uses 25 $20 bills, leaving him with 25 $20 bills.

3. Thomas triples his money.
   - Initially, with the remaining 25 $20 bills, he has 25 ร $20 = $500.
   - Tripling this amount results in $500 ร 3 = $1500.

4. Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills.
   - With $1500, he gets $1500 / $5 per bill = 300 bills.

5. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - After losing 10 bills, he is left with 300 - 10 = 290 $5 bills.

The number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is 290. Therefore, the final answer is {290}."

The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?","To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the time it takes for each to travel to the theater and adjust for Bernadette's desired early arrival.

1. **Wayne's Travel Time:**  
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater.

2. **Bernadette's Travel Time:**  
   - According to the problem, Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.  
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes.

3. **Desired Arrival Time:**  
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. 

4. **Calculate Bernadette's Departure Time:**  
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should complete her journey 5 minutes prior to when Wayne completes his journey.  
   - This means Bernadette should finish her traveling 5 minutes before the 4 minutes it takes Wayne, which totals 4 - 5 = -1 minute.  
   - Since a negative minute doesnโt make sense, this implies Bernadette's actual early start (relative to Wayne) is based more on her journey time:  
   - Therefore, she must account for her longer travel duration: Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, so he would start 0 minutes earlier (since she starts negative, which doesn't make sense) and Bernadette's travel duration of 16 minutes means she should leave 11 minutes before Wayne (because the actual journey requires an earlier start to allow Bernadette's longer travel to align with Wayneโs 4-minute travel)  
   - 5 minutes earlier arrival + 16-minute travel = actual earlier starts before Wayne, that is 11 minutes difference.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. 

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, since he planted twice as many as White Oak, he planted:
2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day:
20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day, he planted 1/4 more than what he planted on the first day:
1/4 of 40 is 40/4 = 10.
40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:

Total White Oak trees: 
20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees.

Total Lodgepole Pine trees:

He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"Answer: 

To calculate how much John pays a year for the driving service, we need to consider both the distance traveled and the monthly bonus. 

1. **Distance Traveled:**
   - John works 5 days a week for 50 weeks, so he has 5 * 50 = 250 workdays a year.
   - Each day, he travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.
   - Therefore, in a year, he travels 60 miles * 250 days = 15,000 miles.

2. **Cost Based on Distance:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so for the distance, he pays 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

3. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so he pays 12 * $150 = $1,800 for the bonus per year.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the distance cost and the bonus, John pays $30,000 (for miles) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800 per year.

He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, let's work through the problem step by step:

1. Henry ended up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, which means he initially had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

2. He baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so his intended number of cookies would be 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

3. Henry originally intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies he baked last year. Then:

   \[
   2x = 100
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \) gives:

   \[
   x = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

Thus, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

100,"The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner. The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?","To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to evaluate the meat intake of the players who ate meat:

1. The second player ate beef tips, where each tip is one ounce, and there were 8 beef tips. So, the second player consumed 8 ounces of meat.
2. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. So, the first player consumed 6 ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, the third player consumed 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players did not consume any meat as they ordered vegetarian meals.

Adding these amounts together gives the total ounces of meat consumed:

8 (second player) + 6 (first player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces of meat.

101,"Cameron arrives at 5 pm at a hotel in the Philippines and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.  The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","Answer: Cameron plans to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. 

If he chooses a 12-hour stay costing 1000 pesos, he must pay for the extra 5 hours. The additional cost would be 70 pesos per hour for these 5 hours: 
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for staying 17 hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Alternatively, Cameron could pay for a 24-hour stay, which costs 1600 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron saves by opting for the add-on option, we will subtract the cost of his decision from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (17-hour stay with add-ons) = 250 pesos.

Cameron saves 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for the full 24-hour stay.

102,Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"Ryan earns $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 weeks * $6 per week = $18 in total.

Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. So, he bought 4 ice cream cones in total:
4 cones * $1.25 per cone = $5.

After buying the ice cream cones, Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan needs to determine how many tickets he can buy with the $13 he has left. To find this, divide the amount of money Ryan has by the cost of one movie ticket:
$13 / $6.50 per ticket = 2 tickets.

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

103,"Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","To determine how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cups and Rows**: 
   - Lana has a total of 27 cups divided into 3 rows. Therefore, each row has 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

2. **Cups for Cinnamon Tea**:
   - She uses some cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Thus, out of her 27 cups, the remaining for chamomile and mint tea are 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

3. **Cups for Chamomile and Mint Tea**:
   - The 12 cups are divided equally into chamomile and mint tea across the 3 rows.

4. **Equal Distribution**:
   - Since each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea, this total of 12 cups is divided among 3 rows, means each row has 12 / 3 = 4 cups of both chamomile and mint tea combined.

5. **Chamomile and Mint Distribution in Each Row**:
   - The problem states that each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, if there are 4 cups and they are equally divided, each row has 4 / 2 = 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea.

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

104,"Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?","Answer: 

We know that each pizza has 8 slices, and they shared 4 pizzas. So, they had 4 * 8 = 32 total slices.

Becky ate 10 slices, as stated in the problem. And we know that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Therefore, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Therefore, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add Becky's, Jake's, and Silvia's slices together: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

Thus, they ate a total of 31 slices.

There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?","First, we'll calculate the number of candles:

1. There are 8 rooms in the house.
2. For half of the rooms, they use 4 small candles each.
   \[
   \text{Half of the rooms} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Small candles used} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
   \]

3. For the other half of the rooms, they use 5 medium candles each.
   \[
   \text{Medium candles used} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
   \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of flashlights:

1. There is a flashlight for every person.
   \[
   \text{Flashlights for people} = 4 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ flashlight per person} = 4 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

2. Additionally, there are two flashlights for each room.
   \[
   \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights per room} = 16 \text{ flashlights}

Now, let's find the total number of candles and flashlights:

1. Total candles:
   \[
   \text{Total candles} = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
   \]

2. Total flashlights:
   \[
   \text{Total flashlights} = 4 \text{ flashlights (for people)} + 16 \text{ flashlights (for rooms)} = 20 \text{ flashlights}

On Sunday morning, they added  18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?","To solve this problem, we need to track the number of pink and white flamingos on Sue's front yard over the weekend.

1. **Initial Set-Up (Friday Morning):**
   - 18 pink flamingos are placed in Sue's yard.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - One-third of the pink flamingos are taken and painted white. There were 18 pink flamingos, so one-third is 18/3 = 6 flamingos.
   - After painting, these 6 flamingos are returned to the yard as white flamingos.
   - Remaining pink flamingos = 18 - 6 = 12.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - 18 additional pink flamingos are added to the yard.
   - Total number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning = 12 (remaining from Saturday) + 18 (newly added) = 30.
   - The number of white flamingos remains at 6 (those painted on Saturday).

4. **Calculation of the Difference:**
   - Difference = Number of pink flamingos - Number of white flamingos = 30 - 6 = 24.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

107,"Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. How many dollars did she make that day?","To find out how many dollars Shawnda made from inflating tires, we can calculate the number of tires she inflated and multiply by the cost of inflation per tire.

First, the 5 people on bicycles each had 2 tires, as bicycles have 2 tires. Therefore, for bicycles, she inflated:
5 people * 2 tires/person = 10 tires

Next, the 3 people on tricycles each had 3 tires, as tricycles have 3 tires. Therefore, for tricycles, she inflated:
3 people * 3 tires/person = 9 tires

Finally, the one person on a unicycle had 1 tire, as unicycles have 1 tire. Therefore, for the unicycle, she inflated:
1 person * 1 tire = 1 tire

Adding them up, Shawnda inflated a total of:
10 (from bicycles) + 9 (from tricycles) + 1 (from the unicycle) = 20 tires

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made:
20 tires * $0.25/tire = $5.00

108,"Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals. She feeds each of the chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Answer: 

Each chicken receives a total of 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, she needs to provide 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed per day in total.

Wendi already provides:
- 15 cups of feed in the morning
- 25 cups of feed in the afternoon

Thus, she provides 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed before the final meal.

To find out how many cups of feed she needs to provide in the final meal, we subtract the total cups given before the final meal from the total cups needed for the day:

60 total cups needed - 40 cups already provided = 20 cups needed in the final meal.

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the different scenarios where he might not have to submit it:

1. **Extension by the normal teacher**: There is a 40% chance that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance that this won't happen.

2. **Substitute teacher**: There's a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there's also a 50% chance that a substitute will not be there and the homework will be collected.

3. **Personal extension (dog ate assignment)**: Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher to get a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get this personal extension.

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, let's consider the scenarios where he avoids turning it in:

- If the **normal teacher grants an extension**: Marcus won't have to turn in his homework with a probability of 40%.

- If there is a **substitute teacher**: He won't have to turn in his homework with a probability of 50%.

- If neither of the above happens, Marcus has a **personal extension chance**: This comes into play only when the normal teacher neither gives an extension nor is absent. The probability of needing the personal extension because both earlier chances failed is calculated by considering the cases where the normal teacher comes in and doesnโt give an extension, and thereโs no substitute; the chance of granting a personal extension is 20%.

### Calculate the overall probabilities:

1. **Fails all three checks and has to submit**:
   - Teacher doesn't provide an extension (60%)
   - Substitute doesn't come (50%)
   - Personal extension fails (80%)
   - Probability of this specific scenario: 0.60 * 0.50 * 0.80 = 0.24 or 24%

So, Marcus has a 24% chance of having to turn in his homework considering all factors.

112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of buttons Lorraine receives from her trades.

1. **Trading large stickers:**

   Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.

   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
     50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
     Each large sticker is worth one large button. So, 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.
     Each large button, in turn, is worth three small stickers. So, 20 large buttons are equivalent to 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
     Each large sticker is worth three small buttons. So, 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

2. **Trading small stickers:**

   Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.

   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
     90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
     Three small stickers are worth one large button. So, 27 small stickers are worth 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Total buttons:**

   - For the large stickers:
     Lorraine gets 60 small buttons from trading the remaining 20 large stickers.
     She also earns 60 small stickers equivalent from trading half of her large stickers into large ones, but they are not directly used as buttons unless exchanged.

   - For the small stickers:
     Lorraine receives 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
     Each large button is worth three small stickers (or equivalently, retains the value of stickers in button form).

   Therefore, in terms of buttons:
   - 60 small buttons from trades.
   - Additional equivalent button value of 9 large buttons (which would equate to 9 * 3 = 27 small stickers/buttons).

   Combining them together:
   Lorraine ends up with 60 (direct small button value) + 27 (equivalent button form value) = 87 total small button equivalent from her trades.

Thus, after these computations, Lorraine has a total of 87 button equivalents.

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"To calculate the total amount spent on senior gifts, we need to determine the cost for picture frames, pins, and cords, and then sum them up.

1. **Picture Frames Cost:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the cost for the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.
   - Each picture frame needs to be etched with a logo, adding an additional 20% cost per frame. Therefore, the etching cost is 20% of $20 = $4.
   - The total cost per etched picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - The total cost for all etched picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1,056.

2. **Pins Cost:**
   - 2 of the seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cords Cost:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords. 
   - The number of officers is 1/4 of 44 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Add the cost of the picture frames, pins, and cords together to find the total cost: $1,056 + $10 + $132 = $1,198.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,198.

A company had sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.,"To determine the refund amount for Mr. Marcellus, we first need to calculate the quantity of expired milk that was returned.

The store bought a total of 4000 gallons of milk. According to the problem, 2/5 of the milk was expired and thus eligible for a refund. 

Calculating the amount of expired milk:
\[ \text{Expired Milk} = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount using the cost per gallon, which is $3.50:
\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.50 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of \$5600 for the expired milk.

   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

3. **Day 7:**
   - He did not travel at all. 
   - Distance traveled on this day = 0 kilometers.

4. **Second Week (7 Days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers per day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the week = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Finally, to find the total distance for the entire trip, we add up the distances for each of the segments:
- Total distance = 800 kilometers (first 4 days) + 240 kilometers (next 2 days) + 0 kilometers (day 7) + 2100 kilometers (second week).

Total distance traveled = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

120,"Glue sticks come in packs of 8. Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we'll first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the class.

Each student receives 2 glue sticks, and there are 27 students in the class:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks needed} \]

Glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find the number of packs needed, we'll divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks needed}}{8 \text{ glue sticks per pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole pack. Rounding 6.75 up gives us 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

122,There are 3 classes. Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the school and how many boys are present in each class.

1. **Total Students**: There are 3 classes, each with 20 students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

2. **Total Girls and Boys**: Since the school is 50% girls and 50% boys, the total number of girls and boys each is:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **First Class**: The first class has 15 girls. Thus, the number of boys in the first class is:
   \[
   20 - 15 = 5
   \]

4. **Second Class**: The second class has 12 girls. Thus, the number of boys in the second class is:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]

5. **Third Class - Boys Calculation**: Given that there are 30 boys in the entire school, and we've accounted for boys in the first and second classes:
   - Boys in first and second classes combined:
     \[
     5 + 8 = 13
     \]
   - Boys remaining for the third class:
     \[
     30 - 13 = 17
     \]

Therefore, there are 17 boys in the third class.

The answer is \{17\}."
123,Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate \u00be of their pizzas. Each pizza had 12 slices. How many slices of pizza were left?,"To solve this problem, we'll first determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract this from the total number of slices.

1. Calculate the number of slices each person initially had:
   - Since each pizza had 12 slices, and there were five people, the total number of pizza slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

2. Determine how many of their pizzas Bryce and two friends ate:
   - These three people ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - Each person starts with 12 slices, so 2/3 of their pizzas is 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices eaten per person.
   - Since there are three people, they ate 3 * 8 = 24 slices in total.

3. Determine how many of their pizzas the two remaining friends ate:
   - These two people ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - Each person starts with 12 slices, so 3/4 of their pizzas is 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices eaten per person.
   - Since there are two people, they ate 2 * 9 = 18 slices in total.

4. Add the number of slices eaten by all five people:
   - Total slices eaten = 24 (by Bryce and two friends) + 18 (by the other two friends) = 42 slices.

5. Determine the number of slices remaining by subtracting slices eaten from total slices:
   - Remaining slices = 60 total slices - 42 eaten slices = 18 slices.

Thus, there are 18 slices of pizza left.

124,"James buys a plane. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. The plane cost $150,000. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?","To determine how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane and the expenses for the entire year.

1. **Cost of the Plane:**
   - James bought the plane for $150,000.

2. **Monthly Expenses:**
   - Hanger rent: $5000 per month.
   - Fuel cost: Twice the hanger rent, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

3. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   - Total monthly expense = Hanger rent + Fuel cost = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

4. **Annual Expenses:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual expenses are 12 * $15,000 = $180,000.

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the plane + Annual expenses = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year is {$330,000}."
127,"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?","To determine the total number of toys James needs, we first need to calculate the number of dogs at each stage and the number of toys required.

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 

2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs in total. This means he needs 12 toys, but he already has 4. So, he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. After buying 8 more toys, he checks back and finds that there are now twice as many dogs. Initially, there were 12 dogs, now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. 

4. To satisfy all 24 dogs, he needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 he had initially and 8 he bought), so he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

5. When James returns again, 3 dogs have left, so now there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. 

6. With 21 dogs, he needs 21 toys. He already has 24 toys, which is more than enough, so he does not need to buy more. In fact, he has extra toys, since with 21 dogs, only 21 toys are needed.

In total, the toys needed was a sum of the initially required toys (8) plus the additional required (12). However, considering the last count, James already has enough.

The total number of toys James needed was 24 at the maximum point, which was sufficient for all dogs at every stage. He didn't need to buy more than was calculated initially.

128,Billy sells DVDs. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each.  His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs.  His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?,"Answer: Let's break it down customer by customer:

- Billy's first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD. So, 3 customers * 1 DVD = 3 DVDs.
- Billy's next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each. So, 2 customers * 2 DVDs = 4 DVDs.
- Billy's last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs. So, 3 customers * 0 DVDs = 0 DVDs.

Adding all the DVDs sold, we get:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Thus, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

129,Tom plants 10 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?,"To find out how many trees Tom has after 10 years, let's go through the calculation step by step:

1. Initially, Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Over 10 years, Tom plants an additional 10 trees each year. Therefore, the total number of trees planted over 10 years is 10 years * 10 trees/year = 100 trees.
3. Thus, the total number of trees (initial plus those planted) after 10 years is 50 initial trees + 100 trees planted = 150 trees.
4. However, Tom also chops down 2 trees each year. Over 10 years, this results in 10 years * 2 trees/year = 20 trees chopped down.
5. Subtracting the chopped trees from the total gives 150 trees - 20 trees chopped = 130 trees.
6. After these 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130 trees, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
7. The remaining number of trees is 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 91 trees left. 

The answer is {91}."
130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","Answer: 

First, calculate the number of goats sold from each farm:

- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

Now, calculate the remaining goats in each farm:

- Farm X originally had 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, Farm X now has 55 - 10 = 45 goats remaining.
- Farm Y originally had 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, Farm Y now has 45 - 20 = 25 goats remaining.

Finally, add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:

- Farm X has 45 goats, and Farm Y has 25 goats.
- The total number of goats left in both farms is 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

131,"John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  He sells planks for $1.2 each. He can make logs out of 80% of the tree. From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  How much does he make?","To determine how much John makes, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. **Calculate the usable portion of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall and John can use 80% of it.
   - Usable tree height = 80 feet * 80% = 64 feet

2. **Determine the number of 4-foot logs from the usable height:**
   - Since each log is 4 feet long, the number of logs = Usable tree height / Log length = 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

3. **Calculate the total number of planks from the logs:**
   - Each log provides 5 planks.
   - Total planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - John sells each plank for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = Number of planks * Price per plank = 80 planks * $1.2 = $96

Thus, John makes a total of $96 from selling the planks.

132,Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"To serve 20 people with muffaletta sandwiches, we need to determine how many sandwiches Tyson should make. Each muffaletta sandwich serves 4 people, so Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, making 5 sandwiches would require 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is calculated as follows:
5 pounds of meat x $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is calculated as follows:
5 pounds of cheese x $3.00 per pound = $15.00

In total, Tyson would spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"First, we need to calculate the actual number of eggs hidden in the yard. 

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, let's determine how many eggs each person found:

1. **Lamar** finds 5 eggs.

2. **Stacy** finds twice as many as Lamar.
   - So, Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

3. **Charlie** finds 2 less than Stacy.
   - So, Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

4. **Mei** finds half as many as Charlie.
   - So, Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add up all the eggs found:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total eggs found from the number of hidden eggs to determine how many eggs are still hidden:

36 hidden eggs - 27 found eggs = 9 eggs still hidden.

134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","First, let's determine the weight of Nik's crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, we calculate how many boxes he needs. Nik wants to group the crayons in sets of 8, so he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, we find the combined weight of the crayons and the boxes. The total weight is the weight of the crayons plus the weight of the boxes: 

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Twice as many students need size small as extra small.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","To determine how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we begin by establishing the number of students needing each size based on the conditions provided:

1. **Extra-Small (XS)**: 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S)**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

3. **Medium (M)**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Thus, the number of students needing size medium is \( 22 - 4 = 18 \).

4. **Large (L)**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \( 18 / 2 = 9 \).

5. **Extra-Large (XL)**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Thus, the number of students needing size extra-large is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \).

Now, we sum all these values to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

- Extra-Small (XS): 11 shirts
- Small (S): 22 shirts
- Medium (M): 18 shirts
- Large (L): 9 shirts
- Extra-Large (XL): 15 shirts

Total shirts = \( 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \).

He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?","To determine how many additional movies Colby can see within his budget, we first need to calculate how much money he has already spent this month and how much he plans to spend tonight.

1. **Calculate the cost of movies already seen:**
   - Movies on Friday or Saturday: 5 movies ร $10 = $50
   - Movies on other days: 8 movies ร $7 = $56
   - Total spent on movies: $50 + $56 = $106

2. **Calculate the cost of snacks already bought:**
   - Popcorn: 2 tubs ร $8 = $16
   - Candy: 4 boxes ร $2 = $8
   - Total spent on snacks: $16 + $8 = $24

3. **Calculate the total amount spent so far:**
   - Total spent: $106 (movies) + $24 (snacks) = $130

Colby has a budget of $150, and he has already spent $130. Therefore, he has:

\[ $150 - $130 = $20 \]

remaining.

4. **Calculate costs for tonight:**
   - Since it's Friday, a movie ticket costs $10.
   - He wants to buy 1 tub of popcorn and 1 box of candy: $8 + $2 = $10

5. **Determine how many movies he can see tonight:**
   - Since he has $20 left and wants to spend $10 on snacks, he can afford to spend the remaining $10 on a movie ticket.
   - Therefore, he can see 1 movie tonight.

Thus, Colby can see 1 movie tonight considering his remaining budget and planned expenses.

How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is $6.50?","To determine how much Chad still owes, we first need to calculate his total order cost before applying the gift card.

1. Base cost of the burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. Two sauces: $0.25 each, which totals $0.25 * 2 = $0.50
6. Meal upgrade (chips and a drink): $3.00

139,"Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Let's denote the amounts of the ingredients as follows:

- Let \( z \) be the amount (in ounces) of citrus zest and fragrance (since both are equal).
- Let \( s \) be the amount (in ounces) of salt and sugar (since both are equal).
- Let \( o \) be the amount (in ounces) of oil.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( o = 2s \) (since twice as much oil as salt)
2. \( s = 2z \) (since twice as much salt as zest)

Since the total amount is 10 ounces, we have:

\[ o + s + z + z + s = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation gives:

\[ o + 2s + 2z = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( o = 2s \) into the equation, we have:

\[ 2s + 2s + 2z = 10 \]

\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation:

\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]

\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]

\[ 10z = 10 \]

\[ z = 1 \]

Using \( z = 1 \), we find \( s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \).

Using \( s = 2 \), we find \( o = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

1. Calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 3 pounds/sunflower * 4 sunflowers = 12 pounds.

2. Calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations:
   - Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 1.5 pounds/carnation * 10 carnations = 15 pounds.

3. Determine the remaining amount of soil available for roses:
   - The total bag of soil weighs 30 pounds.
   - Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.
   - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

4. Calculate how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil:

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Before its first stop, it had 20 people. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, the bus had 20 people before reaching the first stop.

1. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
   20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60 people.

2. At the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop enter. Therefore, the number of people who enter at the second stop is:
   \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \) people.

   So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
   60 (after first stop) + 30 (second stop) = 90 people.

3. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after doubling is:
   90 (after second stop) \(\times 2 = 180\) people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
   200 (total capacity) - 180 (current number of passengers) = 20 people.

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

144,"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?","Answer: 

First, let's determine the total number of guests who will actually attend the party. Kayla invited a total of:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

This sums up to 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests invited in total.

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond 20, it costs an additional $6 per guest.

The number of additional guests beyond 20 is 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Therefore, the total cost of the party will be the base cost plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251. 

The answer is {251}."
145,"Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","To determine Sasha's profit from selling the leftover lumber, we first need to calculate the selling price of each type of board given the 50% price increase.

1. **2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Original cost per board: $10
   - Price increase: 50% of $10 = $5
   - Selling price per board: $10 (original cost) + $5 (increase) = $15

2. **4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Original cost per board: $16
   - Price increase: 50% of $16 = $8
   - Selling price per board: $16 (original cost) + $8 (increase) = $24

Next, we determine the total selling price for all boards:

1. **Total selling price for ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - $15 per board * 10 boards = $150

2. **Total selling price for five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - $24 per board * 5 boards = $120

Now, we calculate the total cost of the boards at the original purchase price:

1. **Total cost for ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - $10 per board * 10 boards = $100

2. **Total cost for five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - $16 per board * 5 boards = $80

Finally, we calculate the total profit:

1. **Total selling price:**
   - $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270

2. **Total cost:**
   - $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180

3. **Profit:**
   - Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

Therefore, Sasha's profit from selling the leftover lumber is $90.

146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we first need to classify the plants based on water requirements and calculate the water needed for each group.

Crista has a total of 20 plants. Among these, 4 plants need half a cup of water each.

1. Calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup each:
   - 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups.

2. Determine the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup each:
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants needing half a cup = 4
   - Plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 = 16 plants.

3. Calculate the water needed for the 16 plants that require a quarter of a cup each:
   - 16 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 4 cups.

4. Add the water needed for both groups of plants to find the total water requirement per day:
   - Total water = 2 cups (for plants needing half a cup each) + 4 cups (for plants needing a quarter of a cup each) = 6 cups.

The total water Crista needs every day for her plants is 6 cups.

148,"Caroline has 4 children. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. The first child is 6 feet tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","First, let us convert the first child's height from feet to inches. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The answer is {72}."

For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?","To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we must first calculate the revenue for each day separately.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and each car tire generates $40:
- Friday Revenue: 12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Each truck tire generates $60 and each car tire generates $40:
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
- Thursday Revenue: $360 + $160 = $520

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday (the day with higher revenue) and Friday:
- Difference in Revenue: $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to determine how many of each type of bike were sold and then calculate the total revenue from each type.

1. **Total number of Trekking bikes sold:**
   - Half of the total 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so:
     \[
     \text{Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ bikes}
     \]

2. **Total number of BMX bikes sold:**
   - 15% of the total 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so:
     \[
     \text{BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ bikes}
     \]

3. **Total number of MTB bikes sold:**
   - The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes. Therefore, the number of MTB bikes is:
     \[
     \text{MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ bikes}
     \]

4. **Calculate revenue from each type of bike:**

   - **Revenue from Trekking bikes:**
     \[
     \text{Price per Trekking bike} = \$450

152,Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. Each toy car cost $2 and each teddy bear cost $1. Dean bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra $10. How much money does Dean have left?,"Answer: 

First, we calculate how much money Dean spent. Dean buys 6 toy cars at $2 each, which costs 6 * $2 = $12. He also buys 5 teddy bears at $1 each, which costs 5 * $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount he spent at the toy store is $12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17.

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17, Dean would have $28 - $17 = $11 left.

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. Adding this to the $11 he has left gives Dean $11 + $10 = $21.

Therefore, after the extra money from his mother, Dean has $21 left.

154,"A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit within the crate and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of a banana:**

   A banana costs twice as much as an apple. Since an apple costs $0.50, a banana costs:
   \[
   0.50 \times 2 = \$1.00
   \]

2. **Cost of an orange:**

   An orange costs three times as much as a banana. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   1.00 \times 3 = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Cost of 5 bananas:**

   Since each banana costs \$1.00, the cost for 5 bananas is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.00 = \$5.00
   \]

4. **Cost of 12 apples:**

   Each apple costs \$0.50, so the cost for 12 apples is:
   \[
   12 \times 0.50 = \$6.00
   \]

5. **Cost of 7 oranges:**

   Each orange costs \$3.00, so the cost for 7 oranges is:
   \[
   7 \times 3.00 = \$21.00
   \]

Finally, to find the total cost of the crate, we sum the cost of all the fruits:
\[
5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = \$32.00
\]

Therefore, the price for a crate of fruit is \$32.

The answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."

Previously, when she started walking to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. At this time, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?","Explanation: 

Sally originally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
- A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. 40% of 25 is 0.40 * 25 = 10. Therefore, she was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
- She accidentally released half of the 12 yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore, she was left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
- Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, to find out how many balloons Sally carried into the school:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total balloons Sally carried into the school = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.

157,"There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","To calculate how many hours John spends learning in a week, we first determine the total minutes spent in class during the weekdays and then account for the extra learning time on weekends.

1. **Calculate the minutes spent in regular classes during weekdays:**

Each class is 40 minutes long, and there are 6 regular periods in a day. Therefore, the time spent in regular classes each day is:
\[ 6 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he attends regular classes 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), the total time spent in regular classes during weekdays is:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

2. **Calculate the minutes spent in extra classes:**

John has 2 extra classes per day at 40 minutes each, so the total extra class time per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 80 \text{ minutes/day} \]

For 5 days, the total time spent in extra classes is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 400 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Calculate the total learning time for weekday classes:**

Adding the regular class time and extra class time, the total learning time on weekdays is:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} + 400 \text{ minutes} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Calculate the weekend learning minutes:**

John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his total weekday time on learning each on Saturday and Sunday.

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{16} \) of 1600 minutes:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, on Saturday, he learns for 100 minutes, and the same on Sunday, totaling:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

5. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**

Add the weekday learning time to the weekend learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

6. **Convert minutes to hours:**

There are 60 minutes in an hour. Thus, the total time in hours is:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends a total of 30 hours learning each week.

159,"Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average score of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Required for Average:**  
   She needs an average of 93 over 5 tests (after removing the lowest score), which means:
   \[
   93 \times 5 = 465
   \]
   So, the total sum of her five highest scores after dropping the lowest one should be 465.

2. **Find the Current Total (Without the Sixth Test):**  
   Current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.  
   The current total sum of these scores is:
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the Lowest Score to Drop:**  
   Her scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

4. **Calculate the Total of Her Best 4 Scores:**  
   After dropping the lowest score (71), the total of the best 4 scores she currently has is:
   \[
   438 - 71 = 367
   \]

5. **Find the Required Score for the Sixth Test:**  
   To achieve the total of 465 with her four best current scores (367), the score needed on the sixth test would be:
   \[
   465 - 367 = 98
   \]

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping her lowest test score.

The answer is {98}."

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To find out how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to determine how many bandages they used over the three days and how many they had in stock at the beginning.

First, letโs determine how many bandages the nurses used each day:

1. **First day**: The nurses used 38 bandages.
2. **Second day**: They used 10 fewer bandages compared to the first day. Therefore, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. **Third day**: They used half a pack of bandages. Since a bulk pack contains 50 bandages, half a pack contains 50/2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:
- Total used = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.

Next, we need to calculate how many bandages were ordered:

1. **First day**: 1 bulk pack ordered, so 50 bandages added.
2. **Third day**: 2 bulk packs ordered, so 2 * 50 = 100 bandages added.

Total ordered over the three days = 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

We are told that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages remaining. Thus, we know:

Initial bandages + Ordered bandages - Used bandages = Remaining bandages

Let's plug in the numbers:

Initial bandages + 150 - 91 = 78

Solving for the initial number of bandages:

Initial bandages = 78 + 91 - 150 = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","The base price of the truck is $30,000.  
- The king cab upgrade costs an extra $7,500.
- The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \).
- The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats: \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \).
- The upgraded exterior light package costs an extra $1,500.

The total cost of Bill's new truck would be the sum of the base price and all added features:

\[
\text{Base price} + \text{King cab upgrade} + \text{Leather seats} + \text{Running boards} + \text{Exterior light package}

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","To determine how long the winner will be waiting, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

1. **Tim's journey**:
   - Tim lives 2 miles away from the school.
   - He skates at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

   First, convert 2 miles to feet:
   \[
   2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
   \]

   Calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home:
   \[
   \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Steve's journey**:
   - Steve lives 3 miles away from the school.
   - He bikes at a speed of 440 feet per minute.

   Convert 3 miles to feet:
   \[
   3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
   \]

   Calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home:
   \[
   \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the winner and waiting time**:
   - Steve takes 36 minutes to get home while Tim takes 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, Steve will reach home first and will have to wait for Tim.

   Calculate how long Steve will be waiting:
   \[
   \text{Waiting time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The winner, Steve, will wait for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

163,It takes Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we first need to calculate how many feet she rowed to reach the shore and then use that to find out how much water the boat took on.

1. Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her rowing speed is \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \).

2. Since the shore was 64 seconds away, Julia rowed \( 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \) back towards the shore.

3. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. 

4. To find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed, divide the total distance by 10:
   \[ \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 8 \]

5. For each 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Therefore, for 8 sets of 10 feet:

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the capacity of each truck individually. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine Gissela's Truck Capacity:**
   - We are told that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

2. **Determine Gordy's Truck Capacity:**
   - Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
   - Therefore, Gordy's truck can haul \( 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \) pounds.

3. **Determine the Combined Capacity with Gary's Truck:**
   - When all three trucks are combined (including Gary's truck), they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds.
   - So the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds.

4. **Calculate Gary's Truck Capacity:**
   - We must subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total combined capacity with Gary's truck to find out how much Gary's truck can haul.
   - The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is \( 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 \) pounds.
   - Therefore, Gary's truck can haul \( 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \) pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

165,"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many holes were dug by the end of each day and determine how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

- First Day: The pirates dug 10 holes.

- Second Day: The pirates dug 13 more holes. By the end of the second day, they had a total of 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

- Third Day: The pirates dug 8 more holes. However, they stopped digging early to fill in 2 holes. Therefore, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes was 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

- Fourth Day: At the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. Thus, by the end of the fourth day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total by the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

166,"Mr. Robles' first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's first determine the daily consumption of each monkey combined.

1. **Determine daily consumption for the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

2. **Determine daily consumption for the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

3. **Calculate total daily bananas consumed by all three monkeys:**
   - Mr. Robles has three monkeys and provides them with enough bananas for a week.
   - He buys 315 bananas in total.
   - A week is 7 days, so the total daily bananas is \( \frac{315}{7} = 45\) bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day.

4. **Calculate bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys combined:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - The second monkey eats 14 bananas each day.
   - Together, they eat \( 10 + 14 = 24 \) bananas each day.

5. **Calculate bananas eaten by the third monkey:**
   - Since the total daily consumption is 45 bananas and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas combined, the third monkey eats the rest.
   - Therefore, the third monkey eats \( 45 - 24 = 21 \) bananas each day.

The third monkey eats **21** bananas each day.

167,"Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, but only a third of them are his lines. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?","To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each component (the solo song and the two scenes) and find out how many are specifically his.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Since he's singing the entire song, Sean is responsible for all 54 lines.

2. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines for the second scene: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

3. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has 2 \times 54 = 108 lines.
   - Only one-third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines for the first scene: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

Finally, we add up all of Sean's lines:

- Solo Song: 54 lines
- Second Scene: 48 lines
- First Scene: 36 lines

Total number of lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 \]

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","To solve the problem, we start by calculating how many pieces of straw are used for the hamsters and rabbits, then determine how many pieces are allocated to the rats.

1. **Hamsters' Straw**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages ร 5 pieces = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits' Straw**:
   - Rabbits receive a total of 20 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Total Straw**:
   - Total straw distributed among all rodents = 160 pieces.

4. **Straw for Rats**:
   - Straw for rats = Total straw - Straw for hamsters - Straw for rabbits
   - Straw for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

5. **Rats' Straw**:
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let `r` represent the number of rats per cage.
   - Total straw for rats can also be expressed as: 3 cages ร `r` rats per cage ร 6 pieces = 90 pieces of straw.

6. **Solve for `r`**:
   - 3r ร 6 = 90
   - 18r = 90
   - r = 90 / 18
   - r = 5

Thus, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The final answer is {5}."
169,"Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we first need to establish a relationship between the small, medium-sized, and large beans.

1. **Large Beans to Medium Beans**: Given that Grandpa can consume twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 times 75 large beans = 150 medium-sized beans.

2. **Medium Beans to Small Beans**: It is stated that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, if Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, then he can eat 150 medium-sized beans * 3 small beans/medium bean = 450 small beans.

This describes the capacity of how many small beans Grandpa can consume equivalent to him being full on large or medium-sized beans.

Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

170,"Erika is saving for a new laptop. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. The sales assistant told Erika that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. The laptop Erika wants costs $600. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","Let's break down the total savings and costs involved for Erika in buying the laptop.

1. **Total cost of the laptop:** $600
2. **Reductions:**
   - Erika's mom gave her $80: Total now = $80
   - Trade-in of Erika's old laptop reduces the price by $200: Total now = $80 + $200 = $280

3. **Savings and income:**
   - $150 from her part-time job: Total now = $280 + $150 = $430

4. **Additional requirement:**
   - After all contributions and reductions, Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's calculate the effective cost after all the reductions and savings before considering the money she needs in her purse:

- Effective cost after trade-in and momโs contribution = $600 - $200 - $80 = $320
- With her income considered, total needed = $320 - $150 = $170

Erika needs an additional $50 to finalize purchasing the laptop:

- Money provided by Erika's purse = Total cost that needed ($320) - Mangaged total ($280) + Additional needed ($50)

Given that Erika already has $430 from contributions, she should have $320 + $50 - $430 = $30.

Therefore, Erika had $30 already in her purse to meet the total amount required to buy the laptop with the additional $50 she needed.

172,"James gets a job selling used cars. He gets a 10% commission on the profits. He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. How much did he make?","To determine how much James made, we first need to calculate the profit the company made on the cars he sold and then find his commission based on that profit.

1. **Cost to Acquire Cars**:

   James sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000. So, the total revenue from selling all cars is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars} \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car. Therefore, the total cost to acquire all 10 cars is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 250,000 = 75,000
   \]

2. **Profit Calculation**:

   The profit is calculated by subtracting the acquisition cost from the revenue:
   \[
   250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

3. **James's Commission**:

   James earns a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
   \]

Thus, James made $17,500 in commission.

175,There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.  Mariah's grandma was teaching Mariah to knit. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.  How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?,"To determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we first need to calculate the number of yards each used individually.

Mariah's grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. With 364 yards in a skein, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. With 364 yards in a skein, she used:

Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time each person took to complete their chores and then sum up these times to find the total time taken.

1. **Amalia's time to mow the lawn:**
   Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time to walk the dog:**
   According to the problem, Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Thus, Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours to walk the dog.

3. **Dior's time to do laundry:**
   The problem states that Diorโs work took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's. Since no specific value is given for the ""well over"" part, we'll assume the minimum considering it is more than 4 hours. So, Dior took at least Amalia's 4 hours + additional 4 hours = 8 hours to do laundry (assuming the minimum amount for this problem).

4. **Total time taken for all chores:**
   Now sum up the times each person took: 
   - Amalia: 4 hours
   - Megan: 6 hours
   - Dior: 8 hours

   Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

Therefore, the total time spent by all three individuals on their chores is 18 hours.

How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?","To calculate how much Daniel has to spend on all the items, let's first determine the total cost before the discount:

1. **Notebooks**:   
   - 5 notebooks at $1.50 each:  
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50

2. **Pens**:  
   - 2 pens at $0.25 each:  
   - Total cost for pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

3. **Calculator**:  
   - 1 calculator at $12 each:  
   - Total cost for calculator = $12.00

4. **Geometry Set**:  
   - 1 geometry set at $10:  
   - Total cost for geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $12.00 (calculator) + $10.00 (geometry set) = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to this total:

Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Then, subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to find the final amount Daniel needs to spend:

Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

1. **Monday:**
   Lucy sold apples picked on Monday for $4 each and made $56. To find out how many apples she picked, we can divide the total money made by the price per apple: 
   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \, \text{apples}
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   The problem stated that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, she picked:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \, \text{apples}
   \]

Now, add up all the apples picked over the three days:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 \, (\text{Monday}) + 12 \, (\text{Tuesday}) + 24 \, (\text{Wednesday}) = 50 \, \text{apples}

One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","We begin by determining the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Therefore, there are 25 indoor plants in the garden.

The remaining plants are those that are not indoor plants. This is given by subtracting the indoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[
100 - 25 = 75
\]

These 75 plants are divided into outdoor plants and flowering plants. We're told that two-thirds of the non-indoor plants are outdoor plants. So, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the 75 plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[
75 - 50 = 25

186,Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?,"Answer: 

First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount. The first pack is worth $400, and the second pack is worth twice that amount. Therefore, the second pack costs 2 * $400 = $800. 

So the total cost for both packs before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packs, which means he saves 20% of $1200. To find this savings, we calculate:

20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Therefore, the discounted price for the two packs is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. 

Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted price, the total cost is:

$960 (discounted packs) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent in total is $1110.

The answer is {1110}."
187,John is a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class.  Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"Answer: To find the capacity of each of John's classes, we first need to determine what 1/8 of Ali's class capacity is. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 

So, each of John's classes can hold:
\[ 120 \times \frac{1}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes will be:
\[ 15 \text{ students/class} \times 2 \text{ classes} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we need to find the combined capacity of both schools. Ali's school's total capacity is 120 students, while John's school's total capacity is 30 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \text{The combined capacity of both schools is } \{150\} \]"
188,"Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store.  She paid $7 in all. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","To find out how many dollars each pack of strawberry gum costs, we start by understanding Suzie's total purchase:

1. Total price for all gum: $7  
2. Price of 1 pack of grape gum: $2  
3. Price of 1 pack of green apple gum: $2/2 = $1  

Therefore, adding up the costs of the grape and green apple gum:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
Total cost for the grape and green apple gum = $2 + $1 = $3  

Now, subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total amount she spent to find the cost for the two packs of strawberry gum:
- Total cost for strawberry gum = $7 - $3 = $4  

She bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the cost per pack of strawberry gum is:
- Price per pack of strawberry gum = $4 / 2 = $2  

Thus, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

189,"Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  In total, he bought 3 packs for $1800 each. How much money profit did he make?","To find the profit Mark made, we need to calculate his total income from selling the cards and subtract his total cost from it.

1. **Calculate the total value of the cards:**
   - Mark has one card worth $4000.
   - Another card is worth $1000.
   - He has 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. 
     So, their total value is 30 cards ร $50 = $1500.

2. **Total value of all cards:**
   - The total value from the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

3. **Calculate the cost of buying the packs:**
   - Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each.
     Therefore, his total cost is 3 packs ร $1800 = $5400.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total value of the cards minus the cost of buying the packs.
   - Mark's profit is $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","To solve the problem, let's start by determining how many cards Elaine collected each month.

1. **First month**:
   - Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Second month**:
   - She collected three times the number she had in the first month.
   - Number of cards collected in the second month = 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

3. **Third month**:
   - She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   - Total cards collected in the first two months = 20 (first month) + 60 (second month) = 80 cards.
   - Number of cards collected in the third month = 2 * 80 = 160 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the second month: 60
- Cards collected in the third month: 160
  
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 160 = 240 cards.

191,"Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's carefully examine the details given about each train's schedule:

1. **First Train Schedule:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 10 + 20 = **30 minutes** after Paul's initial waiting begins.

2. **Second Train Schedule:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's departure.
   - Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = **60 minutes** after Paul's initial waiting begins.
   - It stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = **5 minutes**.
   - It leaves at 60 + 5 = **65 minutes** after Paul's initial waiting begins.

3. **Third Train Schedule:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives at 65 + 60 = **125 minutes** after the initial time count.
   - The train leaves immediately after it arrives.

4. **Fourth Train Schedule:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Since the third train leaves immediately upon arrival, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = **145 minutes** after Paul's initial waiting began.

Since Paul needs to wait until the fourth train arrives, he will wait for a total of 145 minutes before he can board his train.

The answer is {145}."
192,A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to determine the number of each type of car and then check for the total number of cars which is given as 75.

1. **Red Cars:** The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:** They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

3. **Blue Cars:** The problem states the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. Let's denote the number of blue cars as \( B \). Since the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, we have \( B = 3 \times 10 = 30 \).

4. **Total Cars:** We have:
   - Red cars = 12
   - Green cars = 10
   - Blue cars = 30

   The number of yellow cars is \( Y \).

   According to the problem, the total number of cars is 75:

   \[
   12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers paid = 75% of $2000 = 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

2. Determine the selling price to Mr. Rogers' friend:
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
   - Selling price = 120% of $1500 = 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

3. Calculate the percentage discount from the original price:
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The selling price to the friend is $1800.
   - The discount amount = Original price - Selling price = $2000 - $1800 = $200.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is \(0.6 \times 20 = 12\) miles.

He swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour, so the time it takes him to swim this distance is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) hours.

After reaching the island, he rests for half as long as he swam, which is \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) hours.

The remaining distance to swim is \(20 - 12 = 8\) miles.

He swims this remaining distance at half the original speed, so his speed is \(\frac{2}{2} = 1\) mile per hour.

The time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is \(\frac{8}{1} = 8\) hours.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?","First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Sally buys 1 pound at full price, which is $3, and gets the second pound at half off. So the second pound costs $1.50 (which is $3 divided by 2). Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is given as $1.50.

Then, we'll calculate the total cost of the magnets. Sally buys 4 magnets, each costing $0.25, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all Sally's expenses:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1

The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To determine when the cost of both venues will be equal, we can set up an equation. We'll denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food. Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person with food included. Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the total cost of both venues is equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve the equation for \( x \):
1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, it would require 10 guests for the costs of both venues to be equal.

In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's start by defining the variables for the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each of the three sets:

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
- In the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, which is \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is \(\frac{x}{2} \).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, the equation is:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine the terms:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term in the equation by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2(\frac{x}{2}) = 2(19) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine the \( x \) terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of tennis balls in the second set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \) tennis balls in the first set.

2. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. 4 dozen equals 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

3. Greta was also sent home from her office with 1/2 dozen brownies. 1/2 dozen equals 6 brownies.

Adding these together gives us the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

12 (Greta's own brownies) + 48 (friends' brownies) + 6 (office brownies) = 66 brownies.

Next, we need to account for the brownies that were eaten during the party:

1. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen equals 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Finally, subtract the eaten brownies from the total number of brownies to find out how many Greta had left over:

66 (initial total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies.

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48. 

The answer is {48}."
209,Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"To determine how much Jean paid, we first need to calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked and the cost without the discount.

1. **Calculate the Total Hours Worked:**
   Jean needs makeup done 6 hours each day, 4 times a week. This results in:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week}
   \]
   The movie took 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours are:
   \[
   24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Cost without Discount:**
   The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. So, the total cost without discount is:
   \[
   120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Apply the 10% Discount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost. First, calculate 10% of $30,000:
   \[
   0.10 \times 30,000 = 3,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   30,000 - 3,000 = 27,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final amount Jean paid after the discount is applied is $27,000.

210,"Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday.  On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?","Answer: Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, and he had the following sales: Tuesday: 15 crates, Wednesday: 12 crates, Thursday: 18 crates, and over the weekend: 20 crates. By summing these amounts, Sam sold a total of 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates during the week. To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, subtract the number of crates he sold from his target number: 120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates. Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his weekly target.

She also takes a scanner for \u20ac157, a CD burner worth \u20ac74 and a printer for \u20ac102. She has a budget of \u20ac1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. How much money will she have left for her clothing?","Answer: First, we calculate the total cost of Elvira's selected computer and accessories. 

The cost of the computer, including the screen, keyboard, and mouse, is โฌ1090. 
The cost of the scanner is โฌ157.
The cost of the CD burner is โฌ74.
The cost of the printer is โฌ102.

Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:
โฌ1090 (computer) + โฌ157 (scanner) + โฌ74 (CD burner) + โฌ102 (printer) = โฌ1423.

Elvira's budget is โฌ1500. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
โฌ1500 (budget) - โฌ1423 (total cost) = โฌ77.

So, Elvira will have โฌ77 left for her clothing.

How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?","Maria invited 4 of her friends, so there are a total of 5 people, including Maria. At the start, Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. Her mom then gave each of the 5 people 3 additional balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons each person had after her mom gave them supplemented was 1 + 3 = 4 balloons per person. This means there were 4 balloons * 5 people = 20 balloons in total.

Next, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, she distributed a total of 2 balloons * 4 friends = 8 balloons.

After Maria distributed the balloons, she had 4 - 8 = -4 balloons left, which means Maria had to use some of the balloons her mom gave them. The mistake lies in assuming she can have negative balloons, but her total distribution should be from her received share plus any own she might have had initially.

Therefore, considering correctly, each girl including Maria should have 20/5 = 4 balloons initially received from Maria's mom, they started with equal. The exchange affects only distribution not total count. We still have as:
- Total initially: each having 4 initially, so 20.

The calculation error handled, each friend's initial tally before sharing allowed distributes correctly. The sharing act here costs consideration for each person simple initial to final value, ending consistent total avoids assumption errors for initial prep handling.

Thus, despite distributions post initial equalization setup, total count matches declared act durations before impart: still holds 20 balloons.

If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?","To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we first need to calculate the total number of students trying the escape room and then how long it will take each group to complete.

Given that there are 10 students in each grade level (grades 4 โ 7) participating, we have:

4 grades x 10 students per grade = 40 students

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to determine how many groups of 8 we have:

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Each group uses 45 minutes to try and escape, so the total time required for all groups is:

5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all students to attempt the escape room.

214," When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour. Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  After 2 months, Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","When Billy was first hired, his starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, increasing his salary to $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, Billy received an additional raise of $1.00 per hour, increasing his salary to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so she earns $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we can calculate their earnings as follows:

- Billy earns 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230.
- Sally earns 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

Therefore, Billy earns $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the initial cost and the annual revenue and costs.

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Planting the tree costs $90.

2. **Annual Revenue and Costs:**
   - Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5, generating 7 lemons * $1.5 = $10.5 per year.
   - Annual cost for watering and feeding the tree is $3.

3. **Net Annual Income:**
   - Net annual income is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual cost: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

4. **Total Recovery of Initial Cost:**
   - Carlos needs to earn at least $90 to recover the planting cost.
   - The number of years needed to recover this cost is $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

Therefore, Carlos will start earning money after recovering the initial planting cost in 12 years.

216,Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave to each of them, we first need to add up the total cost of all the items they bought for their father's birthday. 

1. **Cost of the cake:**  
   The cake cost $11.

2. **Cost of the balloons:**  
   They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since $0.5 buys 2 balloons, each balloon costs $0.25. So, for 12 balloons, they spent:
   \[
   12 \times 0.25 = 3\: \text{dollars}

217,"Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","First, we'll determine the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.

Each pair of shoes costs $20, and since Sara wants 2 pairs, the total cost for shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.

Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we'll calculate how much money Sara already has.

Sara babysat the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time. So, she earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. Therefore, her total savings after babysitting is $20 (from babysitting) + $10 (initial savings) = $30.

Now, we determine how much more money she needs to reach $70.

Sara needs $70 (total cost) - $30 (current savings) = $40 more.

Next, we'll calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn an additional $40.

Sara earns $4 every time she mows the lawn. To earn $40, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn is $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money to afford the jacket and shoes.

How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?","To determine how many homes the town will build over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year.

**First Year:**
- The town will build 12 homes in the first year.

**Second Year:**
- In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year.
- So, the number of homes built in the second year is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

**Third Year:**
- In the third year, they will take the count of homes they have built by the end of the second year and double it.
- By the end of the second year, they have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.
- Doubling this amount: 2 * 48 = 96 homes in the third year.

**Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
- Add the homes built each year: 12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.

He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget of $24, we'll evaluate the cost and efficiency of the two lumber options.

1. **Calculate the cost per stick for each lumber option:**
   - A 2 x 4 costs $4 and provides 200 sticks. Therefore, the cost per stick for a 2 x 4 is $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick.
   - A 2 x 8 costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Therefore, the cost per stick for a 2 x 8 is $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick.

2. **Determine how many of each type he can buy with $24:**
   - For the 2 x 4 wood at $4 each: 
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 4s Frederick can buy} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
     \]
   - For the 2 x 8 wood at $6 each: 
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8s Frederick can buy} = \frac{24}{6} = 4

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, let's first track the remaining distribution of the sodas.

Initially, there are:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 9 unshaken sodas

Ellen's brother takes:
- 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas
- 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken sodas

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, further reducing the number of unshaken sodas to:
- 6 unshaken sodas

This leaves Ellen's friend with the following choices:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 6 unshaken sodas

The total number of sodas left for Ellenโs friend to choose from is:
- 2 shaken + 6 unshaken = 8 sodas

The probability that Ellenโs friend selects a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas over the total number of sodas:
- Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas)

The calculation is:
- Probability = 2/8 = 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
- 0.25 * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

1. Zoey's total distance:
   - Zoey spits each of her 40 seeds 10 feet.
   - The total distance for Zoey is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

2. Sydney's total distance:
   - Sydney spits each of her 35 seeds 12 feet.
   - The total distance for Sydney is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Next, we add the total distances for both Zoey and Sydney to find the combined distance they spat their seeds.

- Combined total distance = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet.

Finally, to find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (in this case, two: Zoey and Sydney).

- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","To solve the problem, we need to find the least temperature of the unknown mug so that the mixed water reaches a minimum drinkable temperature of 40 degrees. Donny mixes 4 ounces of water at 33 degrees with 1 ounce from the other mug.

First, let's calculate the total liquid volume in the mixture:
- The total volume = 4 ounces (from the 33-degree mug) + 1 ounce (from the unknown temperature mug) = 5 ounces.

Next, we consider the requirement that the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees to be drinkable. Use the equation for the weighted average temperature of the mixture, given by:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees}) + (1 \text{ ounce} \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

\[
\Rightarrow 40 = \frac{(4 \times 33) + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

\[
\Rightarrow 40 \times 5 = 132 + T 
\]

\[
\Rightarrow 200 = 132 + T
\]

\[
\Rightarrow T = 200 - 132

\[
\Rightarrow T = 68

How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"To determine the worth of the boat after three years, we need to apply each year's depreciation consecutively.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat costs $9000 initially.
   - First-year depreciation is 30%.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - Value at the end of the first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The value at the start of the second year is $6300.
   - Second-year depreciation is another 30%.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - Value at the end of the second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The value at the start of the third year is $4410.
   - Third-year depreciation is 20%.
   - Depreciation amount for the third year: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).

She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to account for her usual sleeping duration and the interruptions due to sleepwalking and waking up earlier.

1. **Usual Sleep Time:**
   - Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which means she typically sleeps for 8 hours.
   - In minutes, this is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Interruption Due to Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. 
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.
   - This means she was not in her bed for these 23 minutes.

3. **Waking Up Earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
   - This means she was awake and out of bed for those 5 minutes.

4. **Calculating Total Sleep on Bed:**
   - Start with the usual sleep duration of 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she was not on the bed due to sleepwalking (23 minutes).
   - Also subtract the 5 minutes for waking up early.
   - Total sleep on bed = 480 - 23 - 5 = 452 minutes.
