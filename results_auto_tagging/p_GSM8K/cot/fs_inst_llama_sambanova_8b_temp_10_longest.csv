0,"Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","To find out how much money the desk costs Carmen, we need to determine how many bids were made before she won. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bid after each of them, there were 3 other bids before Carmen's first bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. So, the first other bid was $200 + $50 = $250, the second other bid was $250 + $50 = $300, and the third other bid was $300 + $50 = $350. 

Carmen bid after each of these bids, so her first bid was $350 + $50 = $400, her second bid was $400 + $50 = $450, and so on. 

Since there were 3 other bids before Carmen's first bid, and each bid increased the price by $50, the total number of bids before Carmen's win is 3 + 1 (Carmen's first bid) = 4. 

Since the bids increase by $50 each time, the total increase in price is 4 * $50 = $200. 

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $200 (the initial price) + $200 (the increase in price) = $400.

The answer is {400}."
1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","In the first year, Steve gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 4 games per month for 12 months, for a total of 48 games. So, at the end of the first year, Steve has 10 + 48 = 58 games.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 5 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, for a total of 12 games. So, at the end of the second year, Steve has 58 + 5 + 12 = 75 games.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 5 games. He also buys 2 games per month for 12 months, for a total of 24 games. So, and 4 games for his birthday. So, at the end of the third year, Steve has 75 + 5 + 24 + 4 = 108 games.

The answer is {108}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes and add it to the time it takes to cut all the potatoes.

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since he has 60 potatoes, the total time it will take to peel all the potatoes is 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato. Since he has 60 potatoes, the total time it will take to cut all the potatoes is 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds.

We need to convert the time it takes to cut all the potatoes from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so 300 seconds is equal to 300/60 = 5 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel all the potatoes (90 minutes) to the time it takes to cut all the potatoes (5 minutes) to get the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes.

90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"To find out how much money James was out, we need to first calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs. Since each CD costs $15 and James gets a 40% discount, the cost of each CD will be 60% of $15. 

60% of $15 = 0.6 * $15 = $9

Since James bought 10 CDs, the total cost will be 10 * $9 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made a total of 5 * $40 = $200 from selling the CDs.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the total cost of the CDs. 

$90 - $200 = -$110

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, we can conclude that James actually lost money on the CDs. The amount he lost is the difference between the total cost and the amount he made.

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, and he bought 10 CDs, we can assume that the remaining 5 CDs were the ones he liked. The cost of these 5 CDs would be 5 * $9 = $45.

James lost $45 on the 5 CDs he didn't like.

The answer is {$45}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to first find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows of seats, each with 18 seats, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72 seats.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, which is 72 / 4 = 18 seats.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, which is 54 / 3 = 18 seats.

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students, which is 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

The answer is {36}."
5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to determine how many glass chips he has in total and then divide that number by the number of chips required per square inch.

Milo has two bags of glass chips, each holding 72 chips. So, he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and the mosaic is to be three inches tall, we need to find out how many chips are required for the height of the mosaic. Since the mosaic is three inches tall, it will require 3 * 12 = 36 chips for the height.

Now, we need to find out how many chips are left after covering the height of the mosaic. We subtract the number of chips required for the height from the total number of chips: 144 - 36 = 108 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we divide the remaining chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can cover: 108 / 12 = 9 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We divide the number of square inches by the height of the mosaic to find out the length: 9 / 3 = 3 inches.

The answer is {3}."
6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to first find out how many miles all the dogs need to walk in total. We know that they need to walk on average 3 miles per day. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk is 3 miles/day * 4 dogs = 12 miles/day.

We know that the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can subtract the miles walked by the other three dogs from the total number of miles they need to walk:

12 miles/day - 1 mile/day - 4 miles/day - 3 miles/day = 4 miles/day

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The answer is {4}."
7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","The perfume company sells 5 of each vanilla scent and 2 of each fruity scent. They have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available. 

The total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.
The total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

The answer is {4}."
8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole himself and compare it to the cost of not fixing it. 

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will have to pay $450 for the damage to his car.

If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25, for a total of 3 * $25 = $75. He will also have to pay a fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. The total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $75 + $120 = $195.

By fixing the pothole, Ron will save $450 - $195 = $255.

The answer is {$255}."
9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of removing the old carpet, installing the new carpet, and the cost of the new carpet itself.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom: 
Area = length * width = 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the cost of removal is:
Cost of removal = Area * $4 = 216 * $4 = $864.

The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the cost of installation is:
Cost of installation = Area * $34 = 216 * $34 = $7,344.

The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the cost of the carpet itself is:
Cost of carpet = Area * $12 = 216 * $12 = $2,592.

The new carpet also requires padding, which costs $2 per square foot. So, so the cost of padding is:
Cost of padding = Area * $2 = 216 * $2 = $432.

Now, let's add up the costs:
Total cost = Cost of removal + Cost of installation + Cost of carpet + Cost of padding
= $864 + $7,344 + $2,592 + $432
= $11,232.

The answer is {$11,232}."
10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joanne gathers:

* 30 apples from the tallest trees
* Half this amount (15 apples) from the shortest trees
* x apples from the average trees

Her sister gathers:

* Twice as many apples from the tallest trees (60 apples)
* 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (45 apples)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation based on this information:

30 + 15 + x = 60 + 45 + y

where y is the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

45 + x = 105 + y

Subtracting 45 from both sides, we get:

x = 60 + y

Now, we know that Joanne gathers x apples from the average trees and her sister doesn't gather any from the average trees. So, the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is x.

We can substitute x = 60 + y into the original equation:

30 + 15 + (60 + y) = 60 + 45 + y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

105 + y = 105 + y

This equation is true for all values of y, so we can't determine the exact value of y. However, we can find the value of x in terms of y:

x = 60 + y

Since x is the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we can substitute x into the equation:

x = 60 + y

However, we are asked to find the value of x in the problem statement. To do this, we need more information. Unfortunately, the problem statement doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact value of x."
11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first calculate the total width of the bed. Since the bed is 111 feet long, we need to convert the width between each plant to feet. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, and her flowers grow 12 inches wide. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 12 inches is equal to 1 foot. So, the total width between each plant is 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 feet.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the bed by the width between each plant. However, since the width between each plant is not a fixed multiple of the length of the bed, we need to use the formula for the number of plants that can fit in a row, which is:

Number of plants = (Length of bed - (Number of plants - 1) * Width between each plant) / Width of each plant

In this case, we don't know the number of plants, but we do know that Pat already owns 17 flowers. So, we can plug in the values we know and solve for the number of plants that can fit in the bed.

Let's assume x is the number of plants that can fit in the bed. Then, the number of plants that can fit in a row is x - 1, since Pat already owns 17 flowers. The total width of the bed is 111 feet, and the width between each plant is 2.5 feet.

x - 1 = (111 - (x - 1) * 2.5) / 2.5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2.5:

2.5x - 2.5 = 111 - 2.5x + 2.5

Combine like terms:

5x = 111

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 22.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 22 plants. This means that the remaining space in the bed is 111 - 22 * 2.5 = 0.5 feet. However, since we're not leaving any space between the last plant and the end of the bed, we can fit one more plant in the remaining space. Therefore, the total number of plants that can fit in the bed is 22 + 1 = 23 plants.

However, we know that Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit in the bed:

23 - 17 = 6

This means that Pat needs to buy 6 more plants to fill up her flower bed.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 6 * $6 = $36 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

The answer is {36}."
12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"Let's break down the information we have:

* John spent 40% of his time sightseeing.
* He spent 30% of his time with the following events.
* He spent 6 hours boating.
* He spent half of the time boating swimming, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming.
* He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3*2 = 6 hours watching shows.

We know that John spent a total of 30% of his time with the events (boating, swimming, and watching shows). Let's add up the time he spent on these events:

6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours

Since John spent 30% of his time with these events, we can set up the following equation:

30% of total time = 15 hours

To find the total time, we can convert the percentage to a decimal and divide both sides of the equation:

0.30 * total time = 15 hours
total time = 15 hours / 0.30
total time = 50 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time John spent sightseeing:

40% of 50 hours = 0.40 * 50 hours
= 20 hours

The answer is {20}."
13,"Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. These are his only expenses. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kim has 3 clients already, and he's talking to 5 potential clients, so he's confident enough to include them in his calculations. This means he's planning to have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. So, the total cost for each client is:

2 bottles of bleach x $2 per bottle = $4
1 pack of cloths x $5 per pack = $5
Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total number of clients is 8. The total cost for all clients is 8 x $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we need to subtract the total expenses from the total income:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
= $92 - $72
= $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

14,"Lisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them, because on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. How many people sang in the performance?","To find the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to determine the number of female members in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys, the remaining 50% must be girls. 

Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, we need to consider the 3 teachers who decided to sing with the female members. Since they are not part of the original 52 members, we will add them to the number of girls.

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls + Number of teachers
Total number of people who sang = 26 + 3
Total number of people who sang = 29

The answer is {29}."
15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so the remaining length of the chalk is 5 - (45% of 5). To find 45% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.45: 5 * 0.45 = 2.25. So, the remaining length of the chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher wants to use only 20% of the chalk each day, and he will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. To find out how many days he has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to find out how many times 20% of 2.75 is smaller than 2.

20% of 2.75 is 0.55 (2.75 * 0.20 = 0.55). This means that the teacher will use 0.55 inches of chalk each day.

To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to divide the remaining length of the chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount of chalk he uses each day (0.55 inches).

2.75 / 0.55 = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

16,"Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?","To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth. The length of the pool is 25 feet, the width is 14 feet, and the depth is 4 feet. 

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we multiply 1400 by 5.9.

Number of gallons = Volume * 5.9
Number of gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Number of gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 8260 * $0.10
Total cost = $826

17,"Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","To determine who the winner is, we need to calculate how far each person ran.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards to the line and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times. 

Kelly's total distance is 100 yards (running back and forth once) + 34 * 80 yards (running to the 40-yard line and back) = 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which is 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

To determine who the winner is, we need to compare their distances. Since 2820 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we need to subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.

2820 yards - 1500 yards = 1320 yards.

Therefore, the winner runs 1320 yards farther than the loser.

The answer is {1320}."
18,Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.  The bag has 36 cookies and she puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.  How many cookies does Jenny eat?,"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are eaten by her husband and son.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1*7 = 7 cookies.

Her son eats 4 cookies 5 days a week, so he eats 4*5 = 20 cookies.

In total, 7 + 20 = 27 cookies are eaten by her husband and son.

The bag of cookies has 36 cookies, and Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so she puts 4*5 = 20 cookies in his lunch box.

This means that 20 cookies are eaten by her son, and 7 cookies are eaten by her husband, leaving 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 cookies for Jenny.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"To find the total cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area to be painted and then multiply it by the cost per square foot.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls, which is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint to cover the entire room.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost to paint the room is 12 x $12 = $144.

The answer is {144}."
20,"On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","To find the number of guests the hotel has after dinner, we need to track the changes in the number of guests throughout the day.

Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.

24 guests elect an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24.
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elect for a late checkout, but this doesn't change the number of guests currently in the hotel. It only means that these guests will be staying longer.

7 more people check in after dinner, so the number of guests increases by 7.
76 + 7 = 83

In the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 15 * 2 = 30.
So, 30 more people check in, increasing the number of guests by 30.
83 + 30 = 113

Therefore, the hotel has 113 guests after dinner.

The answer is {113}."
21,"Brendan has a bag of marbles with 10 inside. He tripped over a pebble while carrying it and dropped half of them. One of them he picked up wasn't a marble, but actually a bead so he got rid of it. He only picked up 3 in total. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?","Brendan started with 10 marbles in his bag. When he tripped and dropped half of them, he lost 10/2 = 5 marbles. So, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Then, he picked up a bead thinking it was a marble and got rid of it. This means he was left with 5 - 1 = 4 marbles.

Later, he picked up 3 marbles in total, but since he already had 4 marbles, this means he picked up 3 more marbles to add to the 4 he already had. However, this is not possible because he can't pick up more marbles than he already had. 

So, let's re-evaluate the situation. When Brendan picked up 3 marbles, it means he picked up 3 marbles to add to the 4 he already had. This is possible if he picked up 3 marbles that were among the 5 marbles he lost when he tripped. 

So, Brendan was left with 5 marbles after tripping. He picked up 3 marbles, which means he now has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

The answer is {8}."
22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","To determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds, we multiply the number of pounds he wants to lose by the number of calories burned per pound: 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

Since Andy has approximately 7 months (from December 31st to July 19th) to reach his goal, we need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight: 7 months * 30 days/month = 210 days.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories Andy needs to burn (105,000 calories) by the number of days he has to lose the weight (210 days): 105,000 calories / 210 days = 500 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 500 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.

The answer is {500}."
23,"Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?","To find the total amount of money Artie will make, we need to first round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar. 

The price of marigolds is $2.74, which rounds to $3 per pot.
The price of petunias is $1.87, which rounds to $2 per pot.
The price of begonias is $2.12, which rounds to $2 per pot.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Artie will make by multiplying the number of pots of each type of flower by its rounded price and adding the results together.

Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, so he will make 12 x $3 = $36 from marigolds.
He sells 9 pots of petunias, so he will make 9 x $2 = $18 from petunias.
He sells 17 pots of begonias, so he will make 17 x $2 = $34 from begonias.

Adding these amounts together, we get $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

The answer is {$88}."
25,"Mack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?","To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that number by 7.

Mack saw 50 birds on days 1 and 2. On days 4 and 5, he saw 120 birds. On day 6, he saw 20 birds, and on day 7, he saw 90 birds. On day 3, he saw none.

So, the total number of birds Mack saw is 50 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280.

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by 7:

280 / 7 = 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day.

The answer is {40}."
26,"Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He ordered 100 more after he started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?","Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He then ordered 100 more, so he had a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, he ended up selling 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies he has.

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

27,"Chris is way behind on his math homework. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?","Let's break down the information we have:

* Chris has 100 math problems to complete in total.
* On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
* On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
* On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. To find out how many problems he has left after Tuesday, we need to subtract the problems he completed on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 100 - 12 - 36 = 52 problems. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, on Wednesday, Chris completes 13 problems.

Now, let's find out how many problems he has left to complete on Thursday. We subtract the problems he completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from the total: 100 - 12 - 36 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

28,"Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week and then divide that by 7.

Felix made $105 during the week. Since he charges $.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
= $105 / $.25
= 420 branches

Since Felix climbed branches for 7 days, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

Average branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
= 420 branches / 7
= 60 branches per day

The answer is {60}."
29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 
So in the first 60 seconds, 20 + 60 = 80 kernels pop. 
In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. So, 60/2 = 30 kernels pop in the final 30 seconds. 
After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. So, 30/4 = 7.5 kernels pop from the residual heat. 
Since you can't have a fraction of a kernel, we'll round down to 7 kernels. 
So, in total, 80 + 30 + 7 = 117 kernels pop. 
The answer is {117}."

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?,"Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, so he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum at school. He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum. This leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum. 

Before bed, Jim gives half of the gum he has remaining to his sister, which is 14/2 = 7 pieces of gum. This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight capacity of the farm truck.

The total weight of the sugar cubes is 2 x 1 = 2 pounds.

The total weight of the oats is 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the hay is 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of the carrots is 4 x 12 = 48 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the farmer needs to make 4400 / 2250 = 1.96 trips.

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

Next to Affenpinscher sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?","The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed 10 pounds. The Dachshund, who sat next to the Affenpinscher, weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighed 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon, who sat next to the Dachshund, weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff, who sat at the end of the line, weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Therefore, the Mastiff weighed 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?,"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the number of slices used for each meal and add them up.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate one sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so the total number of slices used for sandwiches is 7 x 2 = 14.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices of cheese.

For the cheese and egg omelets, Carl made omelets for 3 days, and he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total number of slices used for omelets is 3 x 3 = 9.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add up the number of slices used for sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, and omelets: 14 + 8 + 9 = 31.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which is $1 + 2 * $5 = $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5. So, he lost $16.5 on the third race.

To find the total amount he lost, we add the losses from each race: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17 (rounded to two decimal places).

The cost of one dress pant is 1/5 of $750, which is $750/5 = $150.
The cost of 10 dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.
The total cost of the suits and dress pants is $7500 + $1500 = $9000.
The number of dress shirts James buys is 3 times the number of suits, which is 3 * 10 = 30.

How many cookies does he have now?","Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he has 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies.

Then, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he has 8 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies.

Next, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he has 8 + 4 = 12 oatmeal cookies, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"To determine the amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time each of Jack's friends played and then calculate the number of quarters used.

Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20/2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They played for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since they can play for 10 minutes per quarter, the total number of quarters used by these two friends is 240/10 = 24 quarters.

One of Jack's friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They played for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since they can play for 30 minutes per quarter, the total number of quarters used by this friend is 240/30 = 8 quarters.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. They played for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter, the total number of quarters used by Jack is 240/20 = 12 quarters.

41,Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many movies are not in series, how many are older movies, and how many are normal movies. We can then calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are not in series. We can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies not in series = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, let's find out how many older movies there are. Since 40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies =  = 40% of 400
= 0.4 x 400
= 160

Since the remaining movies are not in series, and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Total number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

Now, let's calculate the total cost of replacing the movies. We know that normal movies cost $10, older movies cost $5, and movies in series cost $6.

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies x Cost of normal movie
= 240 x $10
= $2400

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies x Cost of older movie
= 160 x $5
= $800

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series x Cost of movie in series
= 200 x $6
= $1200

Total cost of replacing the movies = Cost of normal movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of movies in series
= $2400 + $800 + $1200
= $4400

He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?,"To find the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the number of years he has been vacationing and the number of vacations he has taken in those years.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, and he is now 34 years old. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on four vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has taken is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each vacation shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the total number of vacations he has taken, which is 44.

How many students are leaving early?","To find the number of students leaving early, we need to find the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of the class are football players, so we can find this by multiplying 0.2 by the total number of students in the class.

Number of football players = 0.2 * 30 = 6

Now, let's find the number of students who are not football players. This is the remaining 80% of the class.

Number of non-football players = 30 - 6 = 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this by multiplying 0.25 by the number of non-football players.

Number of cheerleaders or band members = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we can find the total number of students leaving early by adding the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members.

Total number of students leaving early = 6 + 6 = 12

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B on each day, and then add them together to find the total amount of water pumped into the tank.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water. The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, so Wanda filled 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water into the tank.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. Since Wanda filled 4500 gallons of water, Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons of water into the tank.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day. Since Wanda filled 4500 gallons of water on the first day, she pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water on the second day.

Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. Since Ms. B pumped 3375 gallons of water on the first day, she pumped 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons of water on the second day.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is the sum of the water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days. Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons of water, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons of water. The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

For one of the implants, George wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The answer is {260}."
47,"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?","To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate how much he produces in the second and third weeks.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

To find the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks, we add the amounts produced each week: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, and 36,000 bars have already been produced in the first three weeks, the amount produced in the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate.

The answer: {14000}"
48,"Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?","To find the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought, we need to subtract the number of spoons that Julia's husband bought and the number of spoons that Julia used from the total number of spoons.

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons after her husband gave her the new spoons. Before that, she had used 3 spoons, so she had 12 - 3 = 9 spoons left.

We also know that Julia's husband bought 5 new spoons, so we subtract 5 from 9 to find the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

9 - 5 = 4

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 4 spoons.

The answer is {4}."
49,"A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","To solve this problem, we can start by finding the number of large jellyfish that changed color under UV light. We are told that a third of the large jellyfish change color, and that 6 jellyfish changed color. 

Let's call the number of large jellyfish 'L'. Then, 1/3 of L changed color, which is equal to 6. 

So, 1/3 * L = 6 

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get L = 18. 

Now, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's call the total number of jellyfish 'T'. Then, 1/5 of T is equal to 18. 

So, 1/5 * T = 18 

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get T = 90. 

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank."
50,"Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Let's start with the fact that 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose 7% of the total capacity each hour. This means that for the last 3 hours, the battery lost 7% of its capacity each hour. 

Since the battery lost 28% of its capacity in total, and 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose capacity, the battery must have had 28% + 7% * 3 = 28% + 21% = 49% of its capacity at the end of the 5 hours.

Now, let's work backwards to find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park. We know that the battery was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for some hours before the 5 hours. Let's call the number of hours it took for the battery to lose 49% of its capacity before the 5 hours x. Then, the battery had 100% - 49% = 51% of its capacity when Maria went out to the park.

Since the battery was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for x hours, it must have had 51% + 9% * x of its capacity when the 5 hours started.

However, we know that the battery had 49% of its capacity at the end of the 5 hours. So, we can set up the equation:

51% + 9% * x = 49%

To solve for x, we can first subtract 51% from both sides of the equation:

9% * x = -2%

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by -9%:

x = -2% / -9% = 22.22 hours

However, we know that the battery was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for some hours before the 5 hours. Since x is the number of hours it took for the battery to lose 49% of its capacity before the 5 hours, we can subtract x from 5 to find the number of hours it took for the battery to lose 49% of its capacity before the 5 hours:

5 - x = 5 - 22.22 = -17.22 hours

Since the number of hours cannot be negative, this means that the battery was not losing capacity before the 5 hours. Therefore, the battery was fully charged when Maria went out to the park.

51,"Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","The total number of petals from the first set of flowers is 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
The total number of petals from the second set of flowers is 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
The total number of petals from the third set of flowers is 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
The total number of petals from the fourth set of flowers is 6 * 7 = 42 petals.
However, Rose dropped 1 flower from each of the first three sets and 1 flower from the fourth set. 
So, she dropped a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 flowers.
The total number of petals from the 4 dropped flowers is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.
Since Rose dropped 4 flowers, she actually has 3 flowers from the first set, 4 flowers from the second set, 5 flowers from the third set, and 5 flowers from the fourth set.
The total number of petals from the remaining flowers is 3 * 5 + 4 * 6 + 5 * 4 + 5 * 7 = 15 + 24 + 20 + 35 = 94 petals.
Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 94 petals.

They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, making a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff.

They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, so they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables to display all the stuff.

53,"Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This means Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This means Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by all three:

Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

54,"Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?","In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive. In the next 6 hours, half of that number, which is 30/2 = 15 bees, returned to the hive. So, after the first 12 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours still haven't returned.

In the last 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours flew from the hive and left. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, 2 * 30 = 60 bees flew from the hive in the last 6 hours.

However, the question asks how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours. Since 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours still hadn't returned, and all of them returned in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is 15.

Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?","To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes each month and then multiply that by 12.

Buford writes a check every month for the gas bill, so that's 1 check per month.
He also writes a check every month for the electric bill, so that's another 1 check per month.
Twice per month, he writes a check to the church, which is 2 x 12 = 24 checks per year.
Buford writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, which is 4 times per year.

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
1 (gas bill) + 1 (electric bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 30 checks per year.

56,"Mr. Tan paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to first calculate the total amount he paid in transfer fees and brokerage fees.

The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000. To calculate 3% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.03.

Transfer fees = $400,000 * 0.03 = $12,000

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is also $400,000. To calculate 5% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.05.

Brokerage fee = $400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000

The total amount Mr. Tan paid in transfer fees and brokerage fees is the sum of the two amounts.

Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000, but he still had to pay off the remaining loan amount of $250,000. To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
= $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
= $118,000

57,"Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl. Since he howls for an unspecified number of times, we'll call the number of howls he makes 'x'. The total time he howls is then 20x seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 40x seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so he howls for (20x + 40x) = 60x seconds.

The total time the three wolves howl is then 20x + 40x + 60x = 120x seconds.

Since we want the total time in minutes, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). So the total time the three wolves howl is (120x / 60) = 2x minutes.

However, we still we do not know the value of 'x'. But we know that Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. This means that the total time of Igneous' howl is equal to the sum of the time of Chikote's howl and the time of Tobias' howl.

So, we can write the equation as: 60x = 40x + 20x

Solving for x, we get: 60x - 40x = 20x
20x = 20x

x is not defined by this equation. However, we know that the time of Igneous' howl is equal to the sum of the time of Chikote's howl and the time of Tobias' howl. This means that the total time of the three wolves' howls is the time of Igneous' howl.

Since the time of Igneous' howl is 60x seconds, and we want the total time in minutes, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). So the total time the three wolves howl is (60x / 60) = x minutes.

But we still do not know the value of 'x'. However, we know that Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. This means that the total time of Igneous' howl is equal to the sum of the time of Chikote's howl and the time of Tobias' howl.

So, we can write the equation as: 60x = 40x + 20x

Solving for x, we get: 60x - 40x = 20x
20x = 20x

We can see that the equation is not solvable. However, we can see that the time of Chikote's howl is twice the time of Tobias' howl. This means that the time of Chikote's howl is 40 seconds.

Since Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, we can write the equation as: 60x = 40 + 20

Solving for x, we get: 60x = 60
x = 1

So the total time the three wolves howl is 2x = 2 * 1 = 2 minutes.

58,"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale. To find the discount amount, we multiply the price of the shirt by the discount percentage (30% = 0.30):

$25 * 0.30 = $7.50

So, the discount on the shirt is $7.50. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt to get the sale price:

$25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the sale price of the shirt to the price of the shorts to get the total cost of the outfit:

$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since Joe initially had $50, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from the initial amount to find out how much money he will have left:

$50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

However, we cannot have a negative amount of money, which means that Joe will not have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $2.50.

The answer is {-2.50}."

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So the total cost was 20 * $20 = $400. She got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, the price shot to $30 per pomegranate, but there was a 10% discount on the total cost. So the price Sheila paid per pomegranate was $30 * 0.9 = $27.

The total cost for Sheila was 20 * $27 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine how many books each shelf can hold. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Since the bottom shelf can hold 20 books, the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now that we know how many books each shelf can hold, we can calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold. The two middle shelves can hold 10 + 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold 20 books, and the top shelf can hold 15 books. So, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to be used to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books that one bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2

However, since 2 bookcases can hold 2 * 55 = 110 books, we don't need to buy another bookcase. Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

How many calories is the omelet?,"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet has 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 x 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet has 2 oz of cheese, and cheese is 120 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 x 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet has 2 oz of ham, and ham is 40 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to get the total calories in the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

What is the new balance on her credit card?","Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. She then returned an item worth $15.00, so the amount left on the credit card is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Sheila then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. So, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. So, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?,"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. However, it is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 = 0.20 x $1500 = $300

Increased price = $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is:

$1800 x 3 = $5400

The plane tickets cost $5000 each. Since they are buying two tickets, the total cost of the plane tickets is:

$5000 x 2 = $10,000

He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. He edits an equal number of sentences for Publisher A and Publisher B, so he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 500 sentences x 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 x 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence. So, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 500 sentences x 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts he earns from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

5 + (5 * 2/5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2:

7 * 2 = 14 articles

Now, let's find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes her an average of 4 hours to research and write each article, we multiply the total number of articles by the number of hours:

26 * 4 = 104 hours

The answer is {104}."
70,"Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by the class and subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find out how many points Betty has. We know that Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, who has 50 points. 

30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

We are also told that Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 

So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. 

So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students in the class.

Adam has 50 points, Betty has 65 points, Marta has 105 points, and Tom has 35 points.

Total points collected by the class = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points.

So, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

The answer is {145}."
71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Let's start by defining the variables. Let W be the number of white fish Bob bought at the store, and let O be the number of orange fish Bob bought at the store.

We know that Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, for a total of 7 fish. After buying 17 more fish, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means that the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(3 + O) = 2(4 + W)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + O = 8 + 2W

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:

O = 5 + 2W

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought at the store is 17, so we can set up another equation:

O + W = 17

Substituting the expression for O from the previous equation, we get:

(5 + 2W) + W = 17

Combine like terms:

5 + 3W = 17

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

3W = 12

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

W = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The answer is {4}."
72,"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?","To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to first determine how many stickers he collected this year. We are given that he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, and last year he collected 50 stickers. 

This year, Leo collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

However, we are also told that Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. To find out how many stickers he has now, we need to add the stickers he collected last year and this year to the number of stickers he already had two years ago.

So, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (stickers collected last year) + 100 (stickers collected this year) = 250 stickers.

The answer is {250}."
73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Let's break down the information we have:

* 5 workers are available to work on the order.
* They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift.
* By the end of their shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order.
* 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers who are producing at a known rate:

* 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys an hour.
* Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys an hour.
* So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.

Since the 400 toys were ordered, and the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the 4 workers produce 20 toys an hour, the total number of hours they worked is 380 / 20 = 19 hours.

However, we know that the 4 workers worked for 10 hours, so the 5th worker must have worked for 19 - 10 = 9 hours.

Since the 5th worker worked for 9 hours, and the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 380, the number of toys produced by the 5th worker is 380 / 9 = 42.22 toys per hour.

However, the number of toys produced by the 5th worker must be a whole number, since you can't produce a fraction of a toy. Therefore, the 5th worker must produce 42 toys per hour.

The answer is {42}."
74,"Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.   Stephen added a $4.00 tip. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final bill and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Calculate the total bill before the tip: $40.00
2. Add the $4.00 tip: $40.00 + $4.00 = $44.00
3. Calculate the 25% fee: 25% of $44.00 = 0.25 x $44.00 = $11.00
4. Add the 25% fee to the bill: $44.00 + $11.00 = $55.00
5. Add the $3.00 delivery fee: $55.00 + $3.00 = $58.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.00.

The answer is {$58.00}."
75,Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. The second test has 40 questions. The first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct. She must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?,"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to determine how many questions she needs to get right in total to move on to the 7th grade.

Let's start by finding out how many questions she got right on the first test. Since she got 60% of the questions correct, we can calculate this as:

70 questions * 0.6 = 42 questions

Next, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to move on to the 7th grade. Since she must correctly answer 70% of the total questions, we need to calculate the total number of questions first. We know that the first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions, so the total number of questions is:

70 + 40 = 110 questions

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to get right in total to move on to the 7th grade:

110 questions * 0.7 = 77 questions

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, we can subtract this from the total number of questions she needs to get right to find out how many she needs to get right on the second test:

77 - 42 = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

The answer is {35}."
76,Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"To find the volume of the jar, we need to multiply the area of the base by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6*6 = 36 square inches. The height is 15 inches, so the volume of the jar is 36*15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar available for packing jelly beans is 540*.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432/0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880*.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number.

Since we don't know Tim's guess, let's assume his guess was x. The difference between his guess and the true number is |x - 900|.

To find the difference, we need to know Tim's guess. However, we can still find the percentage difference between his guess and the true number.

The percentage difference is ((|x - 900|) / 900) * 100.

Since we don't know Tim's guess, we can't find the exact percentage difference. However, we can find the percentage difference for different possible guesses.

For example, if Tim's guess was 800, the percentage difference would be ((|800 - 900|) / 900) * 100 = 11.11%.

If Tim's guess was 1000, the percentage difference would be ((|1000 - 900|) / 900) * 100 = 11.11%.

If Tim's guess was 1200, the percentage difference would be ((|1200 - 900|) / 900) * 100 = 33.33%.

We can see that the percentage difference is the same for guesses that are 100 away from the true number. This is because the absolute difference is 100, and the true number is 900.

So, the percentage difference is (100 / 900) * 100 = 11.11%.

The final answer is {11.11}."
77,"Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?","Let's start by analyzing the information given. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. This means if she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 4x red roses. 

She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means if she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 5x pink calla lilies. But we know that 5x = 200, so x = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered 4x red roses, and x = 40, she ordered 4*40 = 160 red roses.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The answer is {160}."
78,Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.  One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.
Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of meatballs in the 4 sub sandwiches Mark ate is 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.
Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatballs in the 3 new sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs.
The number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is the total number of meatballs minus the number of meatballs in the 4 sub sandwiches Mark ate and the 3 new sub sandwiches: 28 - 16 - 12 = 0.

80,"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. 

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings. This means the savings from the jogger jeans is $6 / 3 = $2. 

The savings from the tattered jeans is the total savings minus the savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6 - $2 = $4. 

Since the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22. 

The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $22 - $28 = -$6. 

However, we are asked to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. This is the opposite of the difference we calculated. Since the difference we calculated is -$6, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. However, the problem asks for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is the opposite of $6 less. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans."
81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","To find out how much money John had leftover after paying debt, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount: John gets a loan worth 40% of his house. 
   The value of his house is $250,000. 
   So, the loan amount is 40% of $250,000, which is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.

2. Calculate the amount used to pay off debt: John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. 
   So, the amount used to pay off debt is 60% of $100,000, which is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.

3. Calculate the leftover amount: The leftover amount is the difference between the loan amount and the amount used to pay off debt. 
   So, the leftover amount is $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The answer is {$40,000}."
82,"An air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the total temperature change caused by the air conditioner and the room warming up.

First, let's calculate the temperature change caused by the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room 2 degrees an hour, the total temperature change is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature change caused by the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours. Since it cools the room 3 degrees an hour, the total temperature change is 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change caused by the room warming up for 2 hours. Since it warms up 2 degrees an hour, the total temperature change is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the temperature changes caused by the air conditioner should be subtracted from the temperature change caused by the room warming up. So, the total temperature change is 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

However, we need to consider that the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, which means the room continued to warm up during that time. Since the room warms up 2 degrees an hour, the temperature change during that time is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we need to subtract the total temperature change caused by the air conditioner and the room warming up from the starting temperature. However, we are not given the starting temperature. Let's assume the starting temperature is T.

The final temperature is T - (14 + 4) = T - 18.

So, the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

83,"Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.   He knows that for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars. He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus. Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?","To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the process into two steps: getting customers to come into the dealership and getting them to buy a car.

Step 1: Getting customers to come into the dealership

Jason knows that for every 25 telephone calls he makes, he gets one person to come into the dealership. To find out how many people he needs to call to get 15 customers, we can set up a proportion:

25 telephone calls / 1 customer = x telephone calls / 15 customers

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 25 * 15
x = 375

So, Jason needs to make 375 telephone calls to get 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Step 2: Getting customers to buy a car

Jason knows that for every two customers that come into the dealership, one will buy a car. To find out how many customers he needs to get to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars, we can set up a proportion:

2 customers / 1 car = 15 customers / x cars

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 2 * 15
x = 30

However, this is the number of customers he needs to get to come into the dealership, not the number of telephone calls he needs to make. Since we already determined that he needs to make 375 telephone calls to get 15 customers to come into the dealership, we can multiply this number by the ratio of customers to cars:

375 telephone calls / 15 customers = x telephone calls / 30 customers

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 30:

x = 375 * 30
x = 11250

However, this is the number of telephone calls he needs to make to get 30 customers to come into the dealership, not 15. Since the ratio of customers to cars is 2:1, we can divide this number by 2 to get the number of telephone calls he needs to make to sell 15 cars:

x = 11250 / 2
x = 5625

The answer is {5625}."
84,"Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.  She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","To determine the profit Millie will make per hour, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she will make from selling the lemonade and then subtract the cost of the supplies.

Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, and she makes 3 pitchers, so she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she will make a total of 36 * $1 = $36 from selling the lemonade.

She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so her profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and each cup is sold for $1, she will make $4 per hour from selling the lemonade.

However, this is not her total profit per hour. We need to add the profit she makes from the lemonade to the profit she makes from the supplies. But, since she only spent $18 on supplies, and she will make $36 from selling the lemonade, she will not make any additional profit from the supplies, because the cost of the supplies is already included in the cost of making the lemonade.

Therefore, her total profit per hour will be $4.

The answer is {4}."
85,"Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party. He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?","To determine the number of lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the 5 gallons of lemonade. 

For the 4 standard gallons, each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Since there are 4 gallons, the total amount of lemon juice required for the standard gallons is 4 cups.

For the extra gallon, Tim needs to make a lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means the extra gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.

So, the total amount of lemon juice required for the 5 gallons of lemonade is 4 cups (for the standard gallons) + 2 cups (for the extra gallon) = 6 cups.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 6 cups x 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

86,Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. The first friend says 80. What is their average guess?,"To find the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to first find the number of jelly beans each friend guesses.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60. So the second friend guesses 60 jelly beans.

The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. 25% of 80 is 0.25 x 80 = 20. So the third friend guesses 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now that we have the number of jelly beans each friend guesses, we can find the average by adding them up and dividing by the number of friends. The average is (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

The answer is {80}."
87,"A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?","On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day, they sold double that number, so they sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of tennis shoes on the last day.

In total, they sold 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of tennis shoes by the end of the sale. Since each pair has 2 shoes, they sold 50 * 2 = 100 tennis shoes.

88,"Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Food costs $25 per week.  How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year if there are 4 weeks in a month?","To find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first calculate the total amount she spends per month.

The cost of treats is $20 per month.
The cost of medicine is $100 per month.
The cost of food is $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is $25 * 4 = $100 per month.

So, the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per month is $20 + $100 + $100 = $220.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year is $220 * 12 = $2640.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night, so he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so he watched 1.5 hours of TV. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so he watched 2 hours of TV. 

In total, Frankie watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. This means that he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of TV on Wednesday.

Since Frankie watched a 30-minute show on Wednesday, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. We can do this by dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?,"To find the total number of fireworks that Hannah will see, we need to first calculate the total number of fireworks that will be set off in the city and then find 40% of that number.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah is also setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks in the city and Hannah's backyard is 300 + 15 = 315.

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, which is 40% of 300, or 0.4 * 300 = 120.

However, this means that Hannah will see 40% of the fireworks in the city, but not the fireworks in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks that Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

The answer is {135}."
92,"Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren.

For a hat, it takes 2 skeins of wool, so for 3 grandchildren, Martha will need 2 * 3 = 6 skeins of wool.

For a scarf, it takes 4 skeins of wool, so for 3 grandchildren, Martha will need 4 * 3 = 12 skeins of wool.

For a sweater, it takes 12 skeins of wool, so for 3 grandchildren, Martha will need 12 * 3 = 36 skeins of wool.

For a pair of mittens, it takes 1 skein of wool, so for 3 grandchildren, Martha will need 1 * 3 = 3 skeins of wool.

For a pair of socks, it takes 2 skeins of wool, so for 3 grandchildren, Martha will need 2 * 3 = 6 skeins of wool.

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins of wool needed: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

The answer is {63}."
93,"Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. Each student earns the same amount.  How much did each student raise?","To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 comes from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students and each student earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

The answer is {$6,250}."
94,"Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  He lost 10 bills while getting home.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?","Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account. This means he has 1000/20 = 50 bills.

After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Since he lost 10 bills while getting home, he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for a bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills, each worth $20, he now has a total of 20 * 20 * 3 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, he needs to convert 1200/5 = 240 bills.

95,"Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?","To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find out how long it takes her to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time.

The drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long, which is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne arrives. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The answer is {9}."
96,"To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day than he planted on the first day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, on the first day, Mr. Julius planted a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, he planted 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. Therefore, on the second day, he planted a total of 30 + (40 + 10) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas.  On the second day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas. How many bananas did Gunther count to be in the pile?","To determine how many bananas Gunther counted, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas at each step.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

On the first day, Arnold stole half of the bananas, which is 48/2 = 24 bananas. So, the remaining number of bananas is 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

On the second day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther counted the bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we need to first calculate the total number of miles driven per year.

Since John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, he drives 5 days a week for 50 weeks, which is a total of 250 days per year.

His work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day, so the total distance driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles.

Since he drives 60 miles per day for 250 days per year, the total number of miles driven per year is 60 * 250 = 15,000 miles.

He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

In addition to the cost of driving, he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is 12 * $150 = $1,800.

Therefore, the total cost of driving per year for John is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The answer is {$31,800}."
99,"Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Henry dropped 5 cookies, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before dropping them.
2. He had 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the number of cookies he meant to make is 115 - 15 = 100.
3. He wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so let's call the number of cookies he made last year x. Then, the number of cookies he meant to make this year is 2x.
4. Since the number of cookies he meant to make this year is 100, we can set up the equation 2x = 100.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 100/2 = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The answer is {50}."
100,"The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner. The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?","To find the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the amount of meat eaten by each player and then add them up.

The second player ate beef tips, which are 8 ounces in total, since each beef tip is 1 ounce in size.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.

The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not eat any meat.

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is the sum of the meat eaten by the first three players:

8 ounces (beef tips) + 6 ounces (first player's steak) + 16 ounces (third player's steak) = 30 ounces

101,"Cameron arrives at 5 pm at a hotel in the Philippines and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.  The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of each option and then find the difference between the two.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Option 2: 12-hour stay with additional hours
Cameron will pay 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours. He will then add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Since he wants to stay for 24 hours, he will add 12 hours (24 - 12 = 12) to the initial 12 hours. The additional cost will be 12 * 70 = 840 pesos. The total cost for this option will be 1000 + 840 = 1840 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options:
Difference = Cost of Option 1 - Cost of Option 2
= 1600 - 1840
= -240

However, since the difference is negative, it means that Cameron would actually pay more for the 12-hour stay with additional hours. But we are asked to find out how much money he would save if he chose the 12-hour stay with additional hours. Since he would pay more, he would actually lose money, so the amount he would lose is the absolute value of the difference.

Therefore, Cameron would lose 240 pesos if he chose the 12-hour stay with additional hours.

The answer is {-240}."
102,Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 * $6 = $18. He spent $1.25 * 4 = $5 on ice cream cones. Now he has $18 - $5 = $13 left. He can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. However, he also wants to buy tickets for his 3 friends, so he needs to buy 4 tickets in total. Since he can only afford 2 tickets with his remaining money, he needs to earn more money by doing his chores. If he earns $6 each week, he can earn $6 * 4 = $24 in 4 weeks. This means he can earn a total of $18 + $24 = $42. Now he can buy $42 / $6.50 = 6.46 tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 6 tickets.

103,"Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has 27/3 = 9 cups.
2. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's say she creates x cups of each type in each row. Then, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is 2x.
3. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups is 3(2x) = 6x.
4. We know that the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups is 6x, and the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups (since 15 cups were used for cinnamon tea). So, we can set up the equation 6x = 12.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

104,"Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?","Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Together, Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

Since they shared 4 pizzas and each pizza had 8 slices, they must have eaten a total of 4 * 8 = 32 slices.

However, we know that they actually ate 31 slices. This is because the problem states that Becky ate 10 slices, which is 1 slice less than the maximum number of slices they could have eaten (11 slices).

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?","To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights in each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, and the other half (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.

For the 4 rooms with small candles:
4 rooms * 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles

For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles

Total number of candles = 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

There are 4 people living in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, there are 4 flashlights for the people.

There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights. So, there are 8 rooms * 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights for the rooms.

Total number of flashlights = 4 flashlights for the people + 16 flashlights for the rooms = 20 flashlights

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56

107,"Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. How many dollars did she make that day?","To determine how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply that by the cost per tire.

First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for the bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 * 2 = 10.

Next, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is 3 * 3 = 9.

Finally, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for the unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is 1 * 1 = 1.

Now, let's add up the total number of tires inflated: 10 (bicycle tires) + 9 (tricycle tires) + 1 (unicycle tire) = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, and there are 20 tires, the total amount of money Shawnda made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find the total amount of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find the amount of feed needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per meal. This is 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?","On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. However, his children drank 4 gallons, so there were 24 - 4 = 20 gallons left.

On the second day, Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, there were 8 gallons left for the party.

Since 3 people showed up for the party, the remaining root beer was shared equally among them. So, each person got 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons of root beer.

There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he will have to turn it in.

First, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher comes in. In this case, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension, and a 60% chance she won't. If she doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means that 60% of the time, Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher comes in. In this case, there's a 50% chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework, since the substitute teacher won't collect the homework.

We can calculate the overall probability by multiplying the probability of each scenario by the probability of the substitute teacher coming in, and then adding the results.

The probability of the normal teacher coming in is 100% - 50% = 50%. The probability of the substitute teacher coming in is 50%.

The probability of the normal teacher coming in and Marcus having to turn in his homework is 60% * 50% = 30%.

The probability of the substitute teacher coming in and Marcus having to turn in his homework is 50% * 50% = 25%.

The overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 30% + 25% = 55%.

112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons. Since she has 40 large stickers, she trades 40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers for large buttons and the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.

Now, let's consider the large stickers she traded for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from the large stickers.

Next, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. Since she has 30 small stickers, she trades 30 * 0.9 = 27 small stickers for large buttons.

So, she gets 27 large buttons from the small stickers and 20 large buttons from the large stickers, making a total of 47 large buttons.

In addition, she got 60 small buttons from the large stickers.

Therefore, by the end, Lorraine has a total of 47 large buttons and 60 small buttons, which is a total of 107 buttons.

113,44 seniors need to receive awards.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there is an additional 20% cost for etching the logo. To find the additional cost, we multiply $20 by 0.20, which is $4. So, the total cost of each picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $24 = $1056.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and there are 1/4 of 44 is 11. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

114,Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. He was a pen pal with 5 people.  He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to first determine how many letters he writes per week.

He was pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is still pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike receives 6 * 5 = 30 pages of letters per week.

Mike responds in kind, so he also sends 6 letters a week, each 5 pages long. This means he sends 6 * 5 = 30 pages of letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he can write 60 pages in 60 * 6 = 360 minutes per week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 360 / 60 = 6 hours per week writing.

The answer is {6}."
115,Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?,"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate how long it will take him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time available.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read the book.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time available is 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Since it will take Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading the book 30 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. Therefore, he will be 30 minutes early.

The answer is {30}."
116,Mr. Marcellus realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. A company had sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.,"To calculate the refund, we need to find out how much milk was past its expiry date and then multiply it by the cost per gallon.

First, let's find out how many gallons of milk were past their expiry date. Since 2/5 of the milk was past its expiry date, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600

So, 1600 gallons of milk were past their expiry date.

Since Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk to the company, he would get a refund for the cost of these 1600 gallons of milk. The cost per gallon is $3.5, so the total refund would be:

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

The answer is {5600}."
117,"Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. His soup serves 6 people. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)","To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double the amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

The answer is {2}."
118,"Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?","To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we need to calculate the cost of making 10 jars and the revenue from selling 10 jars.

The cost of making 1 jar is as follows:

- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The revenue from selling 1 jar is $50.

To find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $50 - $44 = $6.

Since Tim sells 10 jars, the total profit is 10 * $6 = $60.

The answer is {$60}"
119,"Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. On the seventh day, he wasn't traveling at all. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?","Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days, so he traveled a total of 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers in the first 4 days.

Over the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, he traveled a total of 240 kilometers over the next 2 days.

He didn't travel on the 7th day, so we subtract 2 days from the total duration of the trip. The total duration of the trip is 14 days, and he didn't travel on the 7th day, so he traveled for 14 - 2 = 12 days in the second week.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day, so he traveled a total of 300 * 12 = 3600 kilometers in the second week.

We add the distance traveled in the first 6 days (800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers) to the distance traveled in the second week (3600 kilometers) to get the total distance traveled. The total distance traveled is 1040 + 3600 = 4640 kilometers.

The answer is {4640}."
120,"Glue sticks come in packs of 8. Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 2 x 27 = 54.

Each pack of glue sticks contains 8 sticks, so to find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack: 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The answer is {7}."
122,There are 3 classes. Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school. We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27. This means that the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

The answer is {17}."
123,Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate \u00be of their pizzas. Each pizza had 12 slices. How many slices of pizza were left?,"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to first determine how many slices each group of friends ate. 

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 4 friends in total, including Bryce, this group consists of 3 people. Each person ate 2/3 of a pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, each person ate (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices. 

The total number of slices eaten by this group is 8 * 3 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, each friend ate (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices.

The total number of slices eaten by this group is 9 * 2 = 18 slices.

In total, the friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices of pizza.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of pizzas is 42 / 12 = 3.5. However, since you can't have half a pizza, this means that the friends had 3 whole pizzas and a half pizza. 

Now, let's find out how many slices were left. The 3 whole pizzas had 3 * 12 = 36 slices. The half pizza had 6 slices. 

In total, there were 36 + 6 = 42 slices of pizza. Since the friends ate 42 slices, there are 0 slices of pizza left.

124,"James buys a plane. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. The plane cost $150,000. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?","To find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly cost of renting a hanger is $5000.

The monthly cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting a hanger, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the hanger rental and fuel costs, which is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Since the plane cost $150,000, we need to add the monthly cost for 12 months to this initial cost.

The total cost for the first year is the initial cost of the plane plus the total monthly cost for 12 months, which is $150,000 + ($15,000 * 12) = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?","Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog had 1 toy.

When James came back, there were 8 more dogs, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needed 12 toys for the 12 dogs.

However, James bought toys for the 12 dogs, but when he came back again, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there were 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs, making a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs.

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needed 28 toys for the 28 dogs.

But when James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he had 28 - 3 = 25 dogs left, and he needed 25 toys for them.

128,Billy sells DVDs. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each.  His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs.  His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?,"Let's break down the information:

* The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 DVDs.
* The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs.
* The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 4 DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs bought by the first 3 customers, the next 2 customers, and subtract the number of DVDs not bought by the last 3 customers (which is 0). However, since the last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, we don't need to subtract anything.

So, the total number of DVDs sold is 3 (by the first 3 customers) + 4 (by the next 2 customers) = 7 DVDs.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. 30% of 150 is 0.3*150 = 45. So, 45 trees die.

After 10 years, Tom has 150 - 45 = 105 trees.

Every year, Tom chops down 2 trees. So, in 10 years, he chops down 2*10 = 20 trees.

After chopping down 20 trees, Tom has 105 - 20 = 85 trees.

The answer is {85}."
130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we first need to determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold in total.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X. He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, in total, he sold 10 + 20 = 30 goats.

Initially, he had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. Now, he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats in Farm X and 45 - 20 = 25 goats in Farm Y.

To find the total number of goats left in the two farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y: 45 + 25 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"To make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20/4 = 5 muffaletta sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he needs a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"To solve this problem, we need to start by finding out how many eggs Charlie, Stacy, and Mei find. 

Since Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, and Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

We know that Lamar finds 5 eggs. So, the total number of eggs found by the four people is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

We are told that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each pound is 16 ounces, we can convert the total weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16. So, the total weight of the crayons in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

Next, let's find the total weight of the boxes. Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8. So, he needs 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Again, since each pound is 16 ounces, so we can convert the total weight of the boxes from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16. So, the total weight of the boxes in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

Finally, we can find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes by adding their weights together. The total weight is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2. How much did everything cost?,"To find the total cost of the coffee and the donut, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee first. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, so the cost of 7 pounds of coffee would be 7 * $5 = $35.

However, since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to the original price.

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive brand would be 7 * $6 = $42.

In addition to the coffee, Roger also bought a donut for $2.

So, the total cost of the coffee and the donut is $42 + $2 = $44.

Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Twice as many students need size small as extra small.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add up the number of students for each size:

11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

Krissa ordered 75 shirts.

He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?","To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount of money his parents give him each month.

Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, so he has spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. He has also seen 8 movies on other days, so he has spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. In total, he has spent $50 + $56 = $106 on movies.

In addition to the movies, Colby has also bought 2 tubs of popcorn for $8 each, which is a total of 2 * $8 = $16. He has also bought 4 boxes of candy for $2 each, which is a total of 4 * $2 = $8. In total, he has spent $16 + $8 = $24 on snacks.

So far, Colby has spent a total of $106 + $24 = $130. His parents give him $150 each month, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend.

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, tickets for movies cost $10. Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost him $8 + $2 = $10. This means he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left to spend on movies.

Since each movie ticket costs $10, Colby can see 1 movie with the remaining $10.

In total, Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 movies on other days, which is a total of 5 + 8 = 13 movies. He can also see 1 more movie on the last day of the month, so in total, he can see 13 + 1 = 14 movies.

How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is $6.50?","The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. So the total cost of the extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. The total cost of the burrito with extras is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which adds chips and a drink. So the total cost of the meal is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so he still owes $14.00 - 5.00 = $9.00.

139,"Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Let's break down the information given:

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so let's call this amount x.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so let's call this amount y.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2y.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2x.

Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we can say y = 2x.

Now, let's consider the total amount of ingredients in the 10-ounce jar:

* Citrus zest: x
* Fragrance: x
* Salt: 2x
* Sugar: 2x
* Oil: 2(2x) = 4x

The total amount of ingredients is x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 10x = 10 ounces.

Divide by 10: x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2y = 2(2x) = 2(2(1)) = 4 ounces.

If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?","To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to calculate how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil needed for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.
So the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. Before its first stop, it had 20 people. So, the total number of people in the bus after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second station. So, the total number of people in the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

Before the third station, the bus had 90 people. The number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, so the total number of people in the bus after the third station is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?","In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.
Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.
The total points Sasha scored during both games is 14 + 4 = 18 points.
The answer is {18}."
144,"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?","To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then apply the fee structure.

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, as well as 13 family members. This makes a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest, we can calculate the additional cost as follows:

Additional cost = (Number of guests - 20) * $6
= (41 - 20) * $6
= 21 * $6
= $126

The total cost is the sum of the base fee and the additional cost:

Total cost = $125 + $126
= $251

The answer is {251}."
145,"Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","To find the profit, we need to first find the selling price of each board. 

The price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards has gone up by 50%, so the new price is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 per board.

The price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards has also gone up by 50%, so the new price is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 per board.

Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so she will make 10 * $15 = $150 from selling these boards.

She has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so she will make 5 * $24 = $120 from selling these boards.

In total, Sasha will make $150 + $120 = $270 from selling all the boards.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards was $10 each, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards was $16 each, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The answer is {90}."
146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many plants need 1 cup of water, how many need half a cup, and how many need a quarter of a cup.

8 plants need 1 cup of water. Since Crista has 20 plants, the remaining 20 - 8 = 12 plants need either half a cup or a quarter of a cup.

4 of her plants need half a cup of water, which is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

The remaining 12 - 4 = 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water needed for all the plants:

8 plants * 1 cup = 8 cups
4 plants * 0.5 cup = 2 cups
8 plants * 0.25 cup = 2 cups

Adding these together, we get 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 cups of water needed every day for Crista's plants.

The answer is {12}."
148,"Caroline has 4 children. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. The first child is 6 feet tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","To find the height of the fourth child, we need to determine the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The answer is {72}."
149,"A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?","On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and earned 12 * $40 = $480. He didn't repair any truck tires, so he earned $0 from truck tires. Therefore, his total revenue on Friday was $480.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and earned 6 * $60 = $360 from truck tires. He also repaired 4 car tires and earned 4 * $40 = $160 from car tires. Therefore, his total revenue on Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, we need to subtract the revenue on the day with lower revenue from the revenue on the day with higher revenue. Since the revenue on Friday ($480) is less than the revenue on Thursday ($520), we subtract $480 from $520 to get $40.

The answer is {$40}."
151,"Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to determine the number of each type of bike sold and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes were sold. We know that half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes sold in total, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:

300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. We know that 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15:

300 x 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes

Now, let's find out how many MTB bikes were sold. We know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type, so we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold:

300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250, and a Trekking bike is $450. We multiply the number of each type of bike sold by its price and add up the results:

Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 x $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 x $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 x $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra $10. How much money does Dean have left?,"Dean started with $28. He spent $2 per toy car and bought 6 toy cars, so he spent 2 * 6 = $12 on toy cars. He also spent $1 per teddy bear and bought 5 teddy bears, so he spent 1 * 5 = $5 on teddy bears. In total, he spent 12 + 5 = $17. After spending $17, he had 28 - 17 = $11 left. His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has 11 + 10 = $21.

154,"A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","Let's break down the information given:

1. One crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
2. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana per piece.
3. One apple costs $0.5.
4. One banana costs twice as much as one apple.

Let's denote the cost of one banana as B. Since one apple costs $0.5, and one banana costs twice as much as one apple, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Now, we know that oranges cost three times as much as a banana per piece. So, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

The total cost of one crate of fruit is the sum of the costs of all the fruits in the crate.

Cost of 5 bananas = 5 * $1 = $5
Cost of 12 apples = 12 * $0.5 = $6
Cost of 7 oranges = 7 * $3 = $21

Total cost of one crate of fruit = $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

156,"As Sally entered school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  Previously, when she started walking to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. At this time, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?","To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. So, she had a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.

When she added 75% of the 8 blue balloons to her clutch, she added 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons. So, she now had a total of 44 + 6 = 50 balloons.

Then, 40% of the red balloons burst, which means 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst. So, Sally was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, which means she released 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons. So, Sally was left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Now, let's count the number of balloons Sally had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. So, she finally carried 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons into the school.

157,"There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","To find the total time the student spends learning each week, we need to calculate the time spent in class, the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday, and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent in class. The student has 6 classes a day, each class is 40 minutes long, and he goes to class for 5 days a week. So, the total time spent in class per week is:

6 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent in class to hours:

1200 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours/week

Next, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday. The student spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning on each of these days. To find the total time spent on extra learning, we need to find the total number of minutes in a week:

7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes/week

Now, we can find the time spent on extra learning on each day:

10080 minutes/week / 16 = 630 minutes/day

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on extra learning to hours:

630 minutes/day / 60 minutes/hour = 10.5 hours/day

The student spends 10.5 hours/day on extra learning on each of Saturday and Sunday, so the total time spent on extra learning per week is:

10.5 hours/day * 2 days/week = 21 hours/week

Finally, we can add the time spent in class and the time spent on extra learning to find the total time spent learning per week:

20 hours/week + 21 hours/week = 41 hours/week

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. How many stamps did Max buy in all?","To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck stamps, rose stamps, and then add them to the number of snowflake stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to first find the total score she needs for the six tests. 

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71. 

We will remove this score from the total score of the first five tests. 

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. 

We will remove the lowest score of 71 from the total score, so the new total score is 438 - 71 = 367. 

Since Brinley wants an average of 93 for the six tests, we will multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score she needs. 

The total score she needs is 93 * 6 = 558. 

Now, we will add the score she needs on the sixth test by subtracting the new total score of the first five tests from the total score she needs. 

The score she needs on the sixth test is 558 - 367 = 191.

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","Let's break down the information:

* On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. They had some bandages left, so let's call the number of bandages they had left at the end of the first day x.
* On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
* On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
* Let's call the number of bandages they had left at the end of the second day y. Then, at the end of the third day, they had y - 25 + 100 - 78 = y - 3 bandages left.
* Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation y - 3 = 78.
* Solving for y, we get y = 81.
* Now, let's go back to the first day. They had x bandages left at the end of the first day, and they used 38 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.
* Since we know that y = 81, and y is the number of bandages they had left at the end of the second day, we can set up the equation x + 28 = 81, since they used 28 bandages on the second day.
* Solving for x, we get x = 53.
* However, this is the number of bandages they had left at the end of the first day, not the number they started with. To find the number they started with, we need to add the 38 bandages they used on the first day: 53 + 38 = 91.

The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500. The towing package is not mentioned, but it is assumed to be an extra feature, so we will include it in the total cost. However, the cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will assume it is $0 for now.

The total cost of the truck is the base price plus the cost of the king cab upgrade, leather seats, running boards, exterior light package, and towing package. This is $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 + $0 = $43,500.

However, we need to add the cost of the towing package. Since it is not provided, we will assume it is $x. The total cost of the truck is then $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 + $x = $43,500 + $x.

To find the value of x, we need more information about the towing package. Since it is not provided, we will assume it is $0.

162,"Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the distance they need to travel and their speed.

Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, and he can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, we can convert the distance to feet:

2 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute
Time = 40 minutes

Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. We can convert the distance to feet:

3 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute
Time = 36 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes to get home, Steve will be waiting at his house for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

163,It takes Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"To determine how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many ten-foot sections Julia rowed. Since she rows 20 feet every 16 seconds, we can divide the total distance (64 seconds) by 16 seconds to get the number of 16-second intervals, which is 64/16 = 4 intervals. 

Since each interval is 16 seconds, and Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can multiply the number of intervals by the distance she rows in each interval. In this case, 4 intervals * 20 feet/interval = 80 feet. 

However, we are interested in 10-foot sections, so we can divide the total distance (80 feet) by 10 feet to get the number of 10-foot sections, which is 80/10 = 8 sections. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, we can multiply the number of 10-foot sections by the amount of water taken on per section. In this case, 8 sections * 2 liters/section = 16 liters.

When Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","Let's denote the weight of gravel that Gissela's truck can haul as x. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, the weight of gravel that Gordy's truck can haul is x + 800.

We are given that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

We also know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. We can substitute this value for x in the equation:

4000 + (4000 + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine like terms:

4000 + 4800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine the constants:

8800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Subtract 8800 from both sides:

Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8800

Gary's truck capacity = 2800

165,"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we first need to determine how many holes they had at the end of the third day. 

We know that they had 10 holes at the end of the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so they had 10 + 13 = 23 holes. On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they also filled in 2 holes, so they had 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes at the end of the third day.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, and they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, they must have had 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

We already know that they had 29 holes at the end of the third day. To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes they had at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, they dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. 

Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as x. 

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week, we can set up the equation:

10 + 14 + x = (315 / 7)

Since 315 / 7 = 45, we can rewrite the equation as:

10 + 14 + x = 45

Combine the constants:

24 + x = 45

Subtract 24 from both sides:

x = 21

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, but only a third of them are his lines. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?","To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and the solo song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, we can find the number of lines he has to memorize by multiplying 60 by 4/5. 

60 * 4/5 = 48

The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can find the number of lines he has to memorize by multiplying 108 by 1/3.

108 * 1/3 = 36

Now, we add up the number of lines Sean has to memorize from each scene and the solo song.

54 (solo song) + 48 (second scene) + 36 (first scene) = 138

The answer is {138}."
168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","To find the number of rats in each cage, let's first calculate the total amount of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits.

The 10 cages of hamsters each get 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.

The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw must be given to the rats.

So, the amount of straw given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90 pieces.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's call the number of rats in each cage ""x"". Then, the total number of rats is 3x.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total amount of straw given to the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the amount of straw given to the rats is 90 pieces, so we can set up the equation:

18x = 90

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 90 / 18
x = 5

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The answer is {5}."
169,"Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","Let's start by analyzing the information given. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. We also know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Let's use this information to find the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 3 * 150 = 450 small beans.

The answer is {450}."
170,"Erika is saving for a new laptop. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. The sales assistant told Erika that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. The laptop Erika wants costs $600. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","Erika has $80 from her mom, $150 from her part-time job, and she traded in her old laptop to get a $200 discount on the new one. So, she has a total of $80 + $150 = $230. After the discount, the price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400. Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, she must have $400 - $50 = $350 in her purse. 

The answer is {$350}."
171,Rani is obsessed with sports cars. She wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour. What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. How fast does the faster car go?,"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which can go 120 miles per hour. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:

120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:

600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

The answer is {750}."
172,"James gets a job selling used cars. He gets a 10% commission on the profits. He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. How much did he make?","To find out how much James made, we need to first calculate the profit made on each car. 

The profit made on each car is the selling price minus the cost price. 
The selling price is $25,000 and the cost price is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
So, the profit made on each car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made is $17,500 * 10 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. 
So, his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

The answer is {$17,500}."

174,Jello is currently on sale for $1.25.  A three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups.  Greg wants to make small jello cups for his son's outdoor birthday party. There will be 30 kids and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have 4 jello cups. How much will he spend on jello?,"To find out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to first determine how many jello cups he needs to make. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, he needs to make a total of 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.

Since each 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. To do this, we can divide the total number of jello cups he needs (120) by the number of jello cups each box makes (10). This gives us 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of jello, we can calculate the total cost. Since each box costs $1.25, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?,"To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to calculate the amount used by Mariah's grandma and Mariah separately and then add them together.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, she used:

1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, she used:

1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

To find the total amount of yarn used, we add the amount used by Mariah's grandma and Mariah:

182 + 91 = 273 yards

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10.  How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?","To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.

The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.

The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.

The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

So, the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 10% of $30, which is 0.10 x $30 = $3.

The final cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

We know that she sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples she picked on Monday is 56/4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24.

One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to first find the number of flowering plants. We know that there are 100 plants in total.

Two-thirds of the plants that are not indoor plants are outdoor plants. This means that the remaining one-third of the non-indoor plants are flowering plants.

Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, three-fourths of the plants are non-indoor plants. 

So, the number of non-indoor plants is 3/4 * 100 = 75.

Two-thirds of the non-indoor plants are outdoor plants, which is 2/3 * 75 = 50.

The remaining one-third of the non-indoor plants are flowering plants, which is 1/3 * 75 = 25.

Therefore, the number of flowering plants is 25.

The percentage of flowering plants is (25/100) * 100% = 25%.

It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.   How much will this cost her?","To find the total cost, we need to determine how many additional items Angela needs to have installed and then multiply that number by the extra cost per item.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. The interior design firm's package includes installing 4 mirrors, 2 shelves (which are not mentioned in the problem, but we'll assume are part of the package), 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. 

Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, 
2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, 
and 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

So, in total, Angela needs 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items.

The extra cost per item is $15.00, so the total extra cost will be 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?","To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of each room and add them up.

The bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. This includes the kitchen, dining room, hallways, and any other rooms that are not the bedrooms or living room.

To find the total area of the house, we add up the areas of all the rooms: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?,"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework, and then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20):

$1200 * 0.20 = $240

The discount amount is $240, so the cost of the packages after the discount is:

$1200 - $240 = $960

The finale firework costs $150. To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the packages after the discount to the cost of the finale firework:

Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, and each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of John's classes = 120 * 1/8 = 15 students per class

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we need to find the combined capacity of both schools. Since Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, and John's school has a capacity of 30 students, the combined capacity is:

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150 students

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","Let's break down the information we have:

* Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
* She paid $7 in total.
* She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
* She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, so the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.
* Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the remaining $7 - $2 - $1 = $4 must have been spent on the 2 packs of strawberry gum.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry gum ($4) by the number of packs (2):

$4 / 2 = $2 per pack.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

In total, he bought 3 packs for $1800 each. How much money profit did he make?","To find the total profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards.

First, let's calculate the total value of the cards:
- The 1 card worth $4000
- The 1 card worth $1000
- The 30 cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500
The total value of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the packs:
Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400

How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","In the first month, Elaine collected 20 Pokemon cards. In the second month, she collected three times that number, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards. However, it is given that she collected 20 fewer cards in the second month than in the first month, so she actually collected 20 + 20 = 40 cards in the second month. 

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is 20 + 40 = 60. So, in the third month, she collected 60 * 2 = 120 cards.

The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. This means that the second train will arrive 20 minutes after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train stays for 20 minutes, it will leave the station 20 + 10 = 30 minutes after it arrives. Therefore, the second train will arrive 30 minutes after the first train arrives, which is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes after Paul starts waiting for the train started.

The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. Since the first train stayed for 20 minutes, the second train will stay for 20/4 = 5 minutes. This means that the second train will leave the station 5 minutes after it arrives.

The third train will arrive 60 minutes after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves 5 minutes after it arrives, it will leave 5 minutes after 40 minutes, which is 45 minutes after the first train arrives. Therefore, the third train will arrive 60 minutes after 45 minutes, which is 105 minutes after the first train arrives.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it will leave 105 minutes after the first train arrives. Therefore, the fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after 105 minutes, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.

Since the first train arrives 10 minutes after Paul starts waiting, the fourth train will arrive 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. Therefore, Paul will wait for 125 minutes for his train.

If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.
4. The rink has 75 cars in total.

We know the number of red, green, and blue cars, so we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)

Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?","To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first need to find out how many signatures they have already collected. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 100 - 64 = 36.

The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they collect signatures every afternoon. Since they have already collected 64 signatures, they need to collect 36 more signatures in the remaining three weeks.

To find out how many signatures they need to collect each week, we divide the number of signatures they need to collect by the number of weeks they have left. 36 / 3 = 12.

194,"Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?","To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs removed over the 5 days and then divide by 5.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

To find the average, we divide the total by 5: 378 / 5 = 75.6.

The answer is {75.6}."
195,Larry loves taking care of animals.  He has 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  How many pets does Larry have?,"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to find the number of each type of pet and add them up.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, so if we let the number of fish be x, then the number of gerbils is x/3.

The fish tank has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now we know the number of fish, so we can find the number of gerbils: x/3 = 21, x = 21 * 3 = 63.

So, Larry has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 63 gerbils, and 21 fish.

The total number of pets is 3 + 9 + 7 + 63 + 21 = 103.

The answer is {103}."
196,"Melanie's mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It requires 200 toothpicks. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?","To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. She saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, so she has collected a total of 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect. This is 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks by dividing 80 by 10. This is 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The answer is {8}."
197,"Jake is shopping at a clothing store. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price.  The original price of each T-shirt is $8. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?","To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts, Jake will pay full price for the first T-shirt and half price for the second T-shirt. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, Jake will pay $8 for the first T-shirt and $4 for the second T-shirt. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 x 0.40 = $16. So, the discount amount is $16. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price: $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The answer is {$36}."

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.   How many lollipops does Oscar have?","Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. So, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

199,"100 people apply for a job at Google.  Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of the people who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. Of the people who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. How many people accept the position?","To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people who accept the position, which is a subset of the people who receive interviews, which is a subset of the people who apply.

First, we find the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the people who apply receive interviews, we can calculate this as:

30% of 100 = 0.3 x 100 = 30

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of the people who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as:

20% of 30 = 0.2 x 30 = 6

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we find the number of people who accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as:

1/3 of 6 = 6/3 = 2

So, 2 people accept the position.

200,"Mr. Rogers sold a watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it.  The watch was originally $2000, but was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it.

The watch was originally $2000, but it was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price at which he bought it. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch is 120% of $1500, which is 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price at which he bought the watch, divided by the original price, multiplied by 100.

So, the percentage discount is (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100 = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

201,"James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at his normal pace.
James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim.
The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

Step 5: Calculate the new speed James swims at to cover the remaining distance.
James swims at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 =  = 1 mile per hour.

Step 6: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at the new speed.
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Step 7: Calculate the total time it takes James to get across the lake.
The total time is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the time to swim the remaining distance.
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

202,"Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\""  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?","To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, she gets 1 pound at $3 and 1 pound at half off, which is $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, which is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 her parents gave her: $10 - $7 = $3.

Sally has $3 left.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of guests is x.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 for each guest, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per person, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the number of guests where the two costs are equal, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The answer is {10}."
204,"A farmer is baling hay in their field. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. This means that every hour, the farmer is producing 2 more bales of hay than the truck is picking up.

Over a 6-hour period, the farmer will produce 5 bales/hour x 6 hours = 30 bales of hay.

The truck will pick up 3 bales/hour x 6 hours = 18 bales of hay.

Since the farmer is producing 2 more bales of hay than the truck is picking up each hour, the net increase in bales of hay in the field each hour is 2. Over a 6-hour period, the net increase in bales of hay is 2 bales/hour x 6 hours = 12 bales.

So, the total number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is the initial number of bales plus the net increase, which is 30 - 18 + 12 = 24 bales.

The answer is {24}."
206,"The Science Center hosted field trips Monday through Friday last week. 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 visited on Friday. Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday compared to Monday. On Monday, 32 classes visited. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?","To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

We know that 32 classes visited on Monday. 

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited compared to Monday, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited compared to Monday, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited on Tuesday.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add up the number of classes that visited each day: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247.

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x/2) + (x + 4) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2:

2x + x + 2(x + 4) = 38

Combine like terms:

3x + 2x + 8 = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x = 6, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set by substituting x into the expression x + 4:

6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  Earlier, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?","To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.

Her friends threw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.

Earlier, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 0.5 x 12 = 6 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 48 + 6 = 66 brownies.

The total number of brownies eaten is 18 + 6 = 24 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 66 - 24 = 42 brownies left over from the entire day.

209,Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs the makeup done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie took 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. The discount amount is $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000.

So, the final amount Jean paid is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?","To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in a week and then subtract that from his target of 120 crates.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates and he only sold 65 crates, we need to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

Crates off from target = Target - Total crates sold
= 120 - 65
= 55

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

She has a budget of \u20ac1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. How much money will she have left for her clothing?","To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories, and then subtract this amount from her budget of €1500.

The cost of the computer with a screen, keyboard, and mouse is €1090.
The cost of the scanner is €157.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

The total cost of the computer and its accessories is €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.

Now, we subtract this amount from Elvira's budget of €1500 to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing:

How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?","Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon. Her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so Maria and her 4 friends each got 3 additional balloons. This makes a total of 3 * 5 = 15 balloons. 

Then, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. Since Maria already had 1 balloon, and she gave 2 to each of her 4 friends, she gave a total of 2 * 4 = 8 balloons. However, she also gave 2 balloons to herself, so in total, she gave 8 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?","To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students will be trying the escape room.

There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students trying the escape room. So, the total number of students trying the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since each group has 8 students, we can divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups will be trying the escape room:

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Each group has 45 minutes to try and escape, so we need to multiply the number of groups by the time it takes each group to try the escape room:

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:

225 minutes / 60 = 3 hours and 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take 3 hours and 45 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The answer is {3 hours 45 minutes}."
214," When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour. Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  After 2 months, Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by Billy and Sally.

Billy's starting salary is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new salary is $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final salary is $11.50 per hour.

Billy works 20 hours, so his total earnings are:

20 hours x $10 per hour = $200 (first 2 months)
20 hours x $10.50 per hour = $210 (next 10 months)
20 hours x $11.50 per hour = $230 (last 10 months)

Total earnings for Billy = $200 + $210 + $230 = $640

Sally's starting salary is $10 + 0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Since she works 20 hours, her total earnings are:

20 hours x $10.50 per hour = $210

Now, we need to find the difference between Billy's and Sally's earnings:

Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings
= $640 - $210
= $430

The answer is {$430}."
215,"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The tree will cost $90 to plant, so Carlos will need to earn at least $90 before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
2. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the total revenue from selling lemons each year is 7 x $1.5 = $10.50.
3. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree, so the net profit from selling lemons each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.
4. Since the tree will cost $90 to plant, Carlos will need to earn at least $90 in net profit before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
5. To find out how many years it will take to earn $90 in net profit, we can divide $90 by the net profit per year, which is $7.50. This gives us:

$90 ÷ $7.50 = 12 years

So, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The answer is {12}."
216,Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"Let's denote the amount of allowance given to each girl as x.

The total amount of money they have is 2x.

They spent $11 on a cake.

They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since they were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, they cost 12/2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons. So, the cost of the balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

They spent $11 + $3 = $14 on the cake and balloons.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

In total, they spent $14 + $14 = $28.

Since they had 2x - $28 left, and this is the amount they used to buy the remaining items (which is 0, because they bought everything they wanted to buy was already accounted for), we can set up the equation:

2x - 28 = 0

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 28

x = 28/2

x = 14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

217,"Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is $20 x 2 = $40. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara needs to earn is $30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times, earning a total of $5 x 4 = $20. She also already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, so she now has $20 (babysitting) + $10 (initial savings) = $30.

To determine how much more money Sara needs to earn, we subtract the total amount of money she needs to earn ($70) and the amount of money she already has ($30). This gives us $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so to determine how many times she must mow the lawn, we need to divide the amount of money she needs to earn ($40) by the amount of money she earns each time she mows the lawn ($4). This gives us $40 / $4 = 10.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The answer is {10}."
218,"A local town is expanding and wants to build several new homes across the next three years. In the first year, they will build 12 homes. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?","In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. To find the total number of homes built in the first two years, we add the number of homes built in the first year (12) and the number of homes built in the second year (36), which is 12 + 36 = 48. Then, they will double this amount, which is 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The answer is {144}."
219,"Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?","To find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

The bagel costs $4. 

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which gives us $1. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5.

Now, we add up the costs of all three items: $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) + $5 (soup) = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner.

The answer is {$11}."
220,"A large t-shirt is 6 square feet of fabric. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A medium t-shirt is 4 square feet of fabric. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?","To find the total square feet of fabric used in the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet from each type of t-shirt and add them together.

The small t-shirts are 3 square feet each, and Octavia is using 11 of them. So, the total square feet from small t-shirts is 3 * 11 = 33 square feet.

The medium t-shirts are 4 square feet each, and Octavia is using 8 of them. So, the total square feet from medium t-shirts is 4 * 8 = 32 square feet.

The large t-shirts are 6 square feet each, and Octavia is using 6 of them. So, the total square feet from large t-shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the total square feet from each type of t-shirt together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The answer is {101}."
221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"Let's break down the information we have:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
4. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.

We can start by finding out how many laps Trey can run. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, and Bethany can run 10 laps, Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Since Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, and Trey can run 14 laps, Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Finally, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps, so Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps.

The answer is {5}"
222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine how many sticks he can get from the cheapest lumber he can buy with his $24 budget.

Let's first calculate how many sticks he can get from a 2 x 4 and a 2 x 8:

- A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks
- A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks

Now, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber:

- A 2 x 4 costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, so the cost per stick is $4/200 = $0.02 per stick
- A 2 x 8 costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, so the cost per stick is $6/400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the cost per stick for a 2 x 8 is lower, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. However, we need to determine how many 2 x 8s we can buy with our $24 budget.

Let's divide our budget by the cost of a 2 x 8:

$24 ÷ $6 = 4

We can buy 4 2 x 8s with our budget, which will give us a total of:

4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600 sticks.

The answer is {1600}."
223,"Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","There are 12 sodas in total, and 3 of them are shaken. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are now 2 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas left. Ellen then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 1 shaken soda and 7 unshaken sodas. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda out of a total of 7 sodas left. The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 1/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/7) * 100 = 14.29%. 

The answer is {14.29}."
224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of the two totals.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The average total distance spat is (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The answer is {410}."
225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","To solve this problem, we need to consider the temperature of the water in the second mug. Let's call this temperature x.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be 33 degrees. The amount of water in the bottle is now 4 ounces, and the amount of water left in the 33-degree mug is 33 - 4 = 29 ounces.

When Donny pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be a mixture of the temperatures of the two mugs. Since the amount of water from the second mug is 1 ounce, which is 1/29 of the total amount of water in the 33-degree mug, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5

Since Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees, we can set up the inequality:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

33 * 4 + x * 1 ≥ 200

Expanding the left side of the inequality:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

The answer is {68}."
226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the boat is $9000.

In the first year, the boat depreciated 30%. To find the depreciation amount, we multiply the original price by the depreciation percentage:

$9000 x 0.30 = $2700

So, the value of the boat after the first year is:

$9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciated another 30%. To find the depreciation amount, we multiply the current value of the boat by the depreciation percentage:

$6300 x 0.30 = $1890

So, the value of the boat after the second year is:

$6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciated 20%. To find the depreciation amount, we multiply the current value of the boat by the depreciation percentage:

$4410 x 0.20 = $882

So, the value of the boat after the third year is:

$4410 - $882 = $3528

The answer is {$3528}."
227,"Each student in Marissa's class started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","There are 30 students in the class, so the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 of 300 pencils were used, which is (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 of 240 pencils were left, which is (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The answer is {80}."
228,"Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to first determine her usual sleep duration. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep duration is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, on that particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she slept for 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

But we also know that she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am. To find out how many minutes she was sleepwalking, we need to convert the time to minutes. 2:15 am is 2 * 60 + 15 = 135 minutes after midnight, and 2:38 am is 2 * 60 + 38 = 138 minutes after midnight. So, she was sleepwalking for 138 - 135 = 3 minutes.

Since she was sleepwalking for 3 minutes, we need to subtract this from her total sleep time to find out how many minutes she actually slept on her bed. Therefore, she slept for 475 - 3 = 472 minutes.

The answer is {472}."
