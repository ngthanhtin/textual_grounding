0,"Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","To determine the final cost of the desk, let's analyze the bidding process step by step.

Initially, Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200. Then, each of the 3 other people bids once, with each bid increasing by $50. After each of their bids, Carmen bids again to stay in the game.

Here's a breakdown of the bidding process:

1. Opening bid: Carmen accepts $200.
2. First person bids: $200 + $50 = $250.
3. Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300.
4. Second person bids: $300 + $50 = $350.
5. Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = $400.
6. Third person bids: $400 + $50 = $450.
7. Carmen bids (and wins): $450 + $50 = $500.

So, after the three other people have bid, and Carmen has responded to each of their bids, she finally wins the desk for $500.

1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Steve starts with 5 games. 

In the first year, he buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he gets 12 more games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he has 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he gets 24 more games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he gets 48 more games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so in total, he has 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. We need to convert 1.5 minutes to seconds to make it easier to add to the cutting time. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 1.5 minutes is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato. 

So, the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare, the total time it will take him is 60 * 95 = 5700 seconds.

We can convert this back to minutes by dividing by 60. 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs he purchased, the amount he sold the unwanted CDs for, and then subtract the amount he received from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of each CD after the 40% discount. 
The discount on each CD is $15 * 0.40 = $6.
So, the cost of each CD after the discount is $15 - $6 = $9.

Since James bought 10 CDs, the total cost is $9 * 10 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40. 

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs from the total cost: $90 - $40 = $50.

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"To find out how many students were in the school auditorium, we need to first calculate the total number of seats available and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

Since there are 18 seats in each row and there are 4 rows, the total number of seats available is:
18 seats/row * 4 rows = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

This leaves us with the remaining seats:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were occupied by students:
72 seats - 18 seats (administrators) - 18 seats (parents) = 36 seats

So, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","To find the total number of glass chips Milo has, we need to multiply the number of chips in one bag by the number of bags he has. Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 72 * 2 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches Milo can cover. 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can divide the total number of square inches by the height to find the length. 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles that all the dogs need to walk. We know that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day, and there are 4 dogs. 

So the total miles that all the dogs need to walk is 4 dogs * 3 miles per dog = 12 miles.

We also know that the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. 

So the total miles that the first three dogs need to walk is 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we subtract the total miles that the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles that all the dogs need to walk to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk. 

12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","To find out which scent sells more and by how much, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The perfume company sells 5 of each of the vanilla scents available, and they have 4 vanilla scents. So, the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

They sell 2 of each of the fruity scents available, and they have 8 fruity scents. So, the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4

So, the perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.

8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","To calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the cost of fixing it himself with the cost of not fixing it and letting it damage his car.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is $450, which is the damage it will do to Ron's car.

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 x $25 = $75, and the fine from the city council, which is $120. So the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $75 + $120 = $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the cost of fixing it himself from the cost of not fixing it: $450 - $195 = $255.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom, then multiply it by the costs of removal, installation, carpet, and padding.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7344.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot * 216 square feet = $2592.

The cost of padding is $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $864 (removal) + $7344 (installation) + $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) = $11232.

10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Joanne gathers:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- Half of 30 apples, which is 30/2 = 15 apples, from the shortest trees
- An unknown number of apples from the average trees

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 x 30 = 60 apples
- 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 x 15 = 45 apples
- No apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. 

We can calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister: 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

We also know that Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x. Then, the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is:
105 (sister's apples) + 45 (Joanne's apples from tallest and shortest trees) + x (Joanne's apples from average trees) = 500

Combine like terms:
150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:
x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we first need to calculate the total space each plant will occupy, including the space between plants. 

Since Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide, we need to convert this to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot.

Each plant will occupy 1 foot (the width of the plant) + 1.5 feet (the space between plants) = 2.5 feet.

However, this 2.5 feet is the space occupied by each plant plus the space to the right of it. For the last plant in the flower bed, we don't need to include the 1.5 feet to the right of it because there won't be another plant to the right of it. So, for the last plant, we will only count its width, which is 1 foot.

So, for n plants, the total space occupied will be 1 + 2.5(n-1).

We know that Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, so we can set up the equation:

1 + 2.5(n-1) = 111

Now we solve for n:

2.5(n-1) = 110

n-1 = 110/2.5
n-1 = 44
n = 45

This means that Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 28 * $6 = $168.

12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"To determine the amount of time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent on the other activities.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, in total, he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours on boating and swimming.

He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

In total, John spent 9 + 6 = 15 hours on these activities.

We are told that these activities took up 30% of his time. Let's call the total amount of time he spent on vacation ""x"". Then, 30% of x is equal to 15 hours.

We can set up the equation: 0.30x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.30: x = 15 / 0.30
x = 50

So, John spent a total of 50 hours on vacation.

Since he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the amount of time he spent sightseeing as follows: 40% of 50 hours = 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours.

Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. These are his only expenses. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?","Kim has 3 clients already and is confident about including 5 more potential clients in his calculations, so he has a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 clients * 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles. The total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 clients * 1 pack per client = 8 packs.

The total cost of the bottles of bleach is 16 bottles * $2 per bottle = $32. The total cost of the packs of cloths is 8 packs * $5 per pack = $40.

So, Kim's total expenses each week will be $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income each week will be $92. To find his profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, the chalk is now 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches long.

Since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he can use it until it reaches 2 inches. This means he can use 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches more of the chalk.

If the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, he will use 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of the original chalk. However, since the chalk is now 2.75 inches long, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 0.75 inches of usable chalk.

Since 20% of the original chalk is 1 inch, 20% of the remaining chalk is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches. 

Now, we need to divide the remaining usable chalk (0.75 inches) by the amount of chalk used each day (0.55 inches is 20% of 2.75 inches, but to make calculation easier we can calculate 20% of the remaining chalk, which is 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55. However we are looking for a simpler ratio. We can calculate the 20% as a fraction of the original chalk and apply to the remaining chalk: 20% of 5 is 1, so 20% of 2.75 is 2.75/5 = 0.55. 20% is 1/5 so we can divide the remaining chalk by 1/5 of the chalk to get the number of days. 0.75 / (2.75/5) = 0.75 * (5/2.75) = 1.36, but we can divide by a fraction by multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction, which is 5/1. 0.75/(1/5) = 0.75 * 5 = 3.75). However, the teacher can only use a fraction of the remaining chalk each day, so we should divide 0.75 by 0.2 * 2.75. But a more straightforward calculation is to calculate how many days the remaining chalk will last if 20% of the chalk is used each day, which is 0.75/(1/5) = 0.75 * 5 = 3.75 days, but that is the number of days the chalk will last if it is 5 inches long, not 2.75 inches long. Since we want the number of days the remaining 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk will last, we can calculate the fraction of the chalk that will be used each day, and divide the remaining chalk by that fraction to get the number of days. However, a simpler calculation is to calculate the total number of days a 5-inch piece of chalk will last at the rate of 20% per day and subtract the days that have already passed. 

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, a 5-inch piece of chalk will last 5 / (0.2 * 5) = 5 days. However, we can calculate the number of days by dividing 5 inches by 1 inch (which is 20% of 5 inches), which is 5/1 = 5.

However, the teacher has already used the chalk for 1 day, so he has 5 - 1 = 4 days left with a new piece of chalk. But he used 45% instead of 20% on the first day. So we need to calculate how many days the chalk that was used on the first day would have lasted if it was used at the rate of 20% per day. 45% of the chalk is 2.25 inches. 2.25 / 1 = 2.25. So the chalk that was used on the first day would have lasted 2.25 days at the rate of 20% per day.

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 days' worth of chalk, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 days left.

The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?","To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons needed, we will multiply 1400 by 5.9.

Number of gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Number of gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost to fill the pool, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","To determine the winner and the difference in distance, we first need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth is equivalent to running 200 yards (100 yards in one direction and 100 yards back). Therefore, Blake ran a total of 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she ran to the 40-yard line and back, the distance for each of these runs is 80 yards (40 yards in one direction and 40 yards back). Therefore, Kelly ran an additional 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly ran a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. The difference in distance is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"To find the total cost to paint the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. There are two walls, so the total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. There are two walls, so the total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find the number of gallons needed: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of each gallon of paint is $12, so the total cost to paint the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","To determine the daily calorie deficit needed to reach Andy's goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. The months of January, February, March, April, May, June, and part of July are included in this time period. 

January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days until Andy's birthday. So, the total number of days is: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit needed by dividing the total number of calories Andy needs to burn (105,000) by the number of days he has to reach his goal (200). This gives us a daily calorie deficit of 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

23,"Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?","To find the total amount of money Artie will make, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar. The marigolds are $2.74, which rounds to $3. The petunias are $1.87, which rounds to $2. The begonias are $2.12, which rounds to $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of flower. Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds at $3 each, so he makes 12 x $3 = $36 from marigolds.

He sells 9 pots of petunias at $2 each, so he makes 9 x $2 = $18 from petunias.

He sells 17 pots of begonias at $2 each, so he makes 17 x $2 = $34 from begonias.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Artie makes from each type of flower. $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

24,"The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag. Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?","Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

So, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.

The answer is {7}."
25,"Mack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?","To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to first find the total number of birds he saw over the week.

On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
On day three, he saw 0 birds.
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

The total number of birds Mack saw is 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Since Mack counted birds for 7 days, we can find the average number of birds he saw per day by dividing the total number of birds by 7.

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.

26,"Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He ordered 100 more after he started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?","Dale started off with 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered and wanted to sell. He then ordered 100 more candies, bringing the total number of candies he had to sell to 100 + 100 = 200. 

However, Dale ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies, which means he still has some candies left to sell. To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold (150) from the total number of candies he had to sell (200).

200 - 150 = 50

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

27,"Chris is way behind on his math homework. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?","To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to first calculate how many problems he completed on each day.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, Chris completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

Now, let's calculate the total number of problems Chris completed on Monday and Tuesday: 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Since Chris has 100 math problems to complete in total, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is: 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. One-quarter of 52 problems is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

Now, let's calculate the total number of problems Chris completed from Monday to Wednesday: 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

The number of problems remaining after Wednesday is: 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

So, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

28,"Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week. We know that Felix made $105 during the week and that each branch he climbed cost $0.25.

Let's first calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week:

Total amount made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total number of branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total number of branches = $105 / $0.25
Total number of branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days (a week), we can now calculate the average number of branches he climbed per day:

Average number of branches per day = Total number of branches / Number of days
Average number of branches per day = 420 / 7
Average number of branches per day = 60

The answer is {60}."
29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 x 20 = 60 kernels.

After 60 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate. Since 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds, the initial rate is 20 kernels per 30 seconds. Four times this rate is 4 x 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds.

In the next 30 seconds (from 60-90 seconds), 80 kernels popped. However, in the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. So, in the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

In total, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

30,"An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange. An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* 4 watermelons cost 4 * $45 = $180
* 20 peppers cost 20 * $15 = $300
* 10 oranges cost 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?","To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to determine how many times it rang each time it went off.

The first time, it rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time it went off: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?,"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chewed and how many he gave to his sister.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school. He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, Jim gives half of his remaining gum to his sister before bed. So, he gives 14 / 2 = 7 pieces of gum to his sister.

After giving his sister 7 pieces of gum, Jim is left with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 * 1 pound = 2 pounds.
The weight of the oats is 20 * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds.
The weight of the hay is 42 * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds.
The weight of the carrots is 4 * 12 pounds = 48 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4500 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

However, this calculation gives us 2, which means the truck would be fully loaded on the first trip, but the second trip would also be fully loaded, with no room for the remaining 0 pounds of feed. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. In this case, though, the division is exact, with no remainder.

Next to Affenpinscher sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?","To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to determine the weights of the other dogs first.

The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighed 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighed 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?,"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the number of slices he used for each meal.

For lunch, he ate a sandwich every day, which is 7 days in a week. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For dinner, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Now, let's add up the number of slices of cheese he used for each meal: 14 slices for lunch, 8 slices for dinner, and 9 slices for breakfast. 14 + 8 + 9 = 31.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $0 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50. However, he also won $11 in the second race, so his net loss is $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"To calculate the total amount of money used, we need to determine how many quarters each person uses per hour and then multiply that by the total number of hours played.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jack uses 60/20 = 3 quarters per hour.

Two of his friends can only play half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20/2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, they use 60/10 = 6 quarters per hour. Since there are two friends, they use a total of 2 x 6 = 12 quarters per hour.

One of his friends is significantly better than Jack and can play for 1.5 times as long. So, this friend can play for 20 x 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, this friend uses 60/30 = 2 quarters per hour.

In total, the number of quarters used per hour is 3 (Jack) + 12 (two friends) + 2 (better friend) = 17 quarters per hour.

Since they play for 4 hours, the total number of quarters used is 17 x 4 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 x $0.25 = $17.

A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of the movies that are not in series and the cost of the movies that are in series.

First, let's find the number of movies that are not in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, two-thirds of the movies are not in series. Two-thirds of 600 is 2/3 * 600 = 400.

Next, we need to find the number of older movies that are not in series. 40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies, so 40% of 400 is 0.4 * 400 = 160.

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The cost of the non-older movies that are not in series is $10 each, and there are 400 - 160 = 240 of these movies. The total cost of these movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Now, let's find the cost of the movies that are in series. There are 600 - 400 = 200 movies in series, and the cost of these movies is 2/3 of the normal cost, which is 2/3 * $10 = $6.67 per movie for the series, but since you can buy the whole series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, the cost per movie in the series will be $6. The total cost of these movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.

The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the cost of the older movies, the non-older movies that are not in series, and the movies that are in series. This is $800 + $2400 + $1200 = $4400.

How many students are leaving early?","First, we need to find out how many students are football players. 20% of the class are football players, so we calculate 20% of 30 students as follows: 
20% = 20/100 = 0.2
0.2 * 30 = 6
So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band. We are told that 25% of the remaining class are cheerleaders or part of band. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining class has 30 - 6 = 24 students.

We calculate 25% of 24 students as follows:
25% = 25/100 = 0.25
0.25 * 24 = 6
So, there are 6 students who are cheerleaders or part of band.

In total, the number of students who are leaving early is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members, which is 6 + 6 = 12.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, the total amount of water pumped into the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the total amount of water pumped into the tank from the tank's capacity:

18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

46,"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. The crown costs an extra $500. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. He's already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?","To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so that's 2 * $2000 = $4000.

One of the implants will have a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

However, George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

47,"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?","To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate how much he produces in the first three weeks and then subtract that from his total monthly production.

We are given that Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total amount produced in the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate.

48,"Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?","Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as x.

Julia initially bought x spoons. Then, her husband bought 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons Julia had was x + 5.

Before setting the table, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the total number of spoons left was x + 5 - 3.

We are given that Julia had 12 spoons when she set the table, so we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

First, we need to find out how many large jellyfish there are. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color and 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * (number of large jellyfish) = 6

To find the number of large jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 3:

number of large jellyfish = 6 * 3
number of large jellyfish = 18

Now that we know there are 18 large jellyfish, and that they make up a fifth of the total jellyfish, we can set up another equation:

(1/5) * (total number of jellyfish) = 18

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 5:

total number of jellyfish = 18 * 5
total number of jellyfish = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

First, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity for 3 hours. So, the total capacity lost in these 3 hours is 7% * 3 = 21%. 

Before this 3-hour period, the power bank had 28% + 21% = 49% of its capacity.

Before this, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity for 5 hours. So, the total capacity lost in these 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. 

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 49% + 45% = 94%.

51,"Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals on each type of flower and then add them up.

Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so the total number of petals on these flowers is 3 x 5 = 15.

Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so the total number of petals on these flowers is 4 x 6 = 24.

Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so the total number of petals on these flowers is 5 x 4 = 20.

However, she drops 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract the number of petals on these dropped flowers. The dropped flowers have 5, 6, and 4 petals, respectively, so we subtract 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals.

Now, Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, but she drops 1 of these flowers. So, the total number of petals on these flowers is 5 x 7 = 35.

To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we add up the number of petals on each type of flower: 15 - 5 = 10 (for the 5-petaled flowers), 24 - 6 = 18 (for the 6-petaled flowers), 20 - 4 = 16 (for the 4-petaled flowers), and 35 (for the 7-petaled flowers).

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 10 + 18 + 16 + 35 = 79.

Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. We know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, and Jim collected 5 more than Carlos. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Then, Carlos collected 2x seashells, and Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells. We are also given that Jim collected 27 seashells. 

So, we can set up an equation: 2x + 5 = 27. 

Now, let's solve for x: 
2x + 5 = 27 
2x = 27 - 5 
2x = 22 
x = 22 / 2 
x = 11 

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. 

Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos and Jim collected. 

Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, which is 2 * 11 = 22 seashells. 

Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, which is 22 + 5 = 27 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected: 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person will get 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?","Debra initially sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 of that number return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees. This means that 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours have not yet returned.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This includes the 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and hadn't returned yet.

Additionally, in the last 6 hours, Debra sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This means 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave in the last 6 hours. However, the question asks for the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, not the number that left.

So, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is the 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and hadn't returned yet, plus the bees that left in the second 6 hours and returned in the last 6 hours. However, the problem doesn't mention any bees leaving in the second 6 hours, only returning. Therefore, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is just the 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and hadn't returned yet, plus the bees that left in the third 6 hours is not relevant to the question of how many bees returned in the last 6 hours. But the problem states every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, and also 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours and 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, so 30 bees left in the first 6 hours - 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours = 15 bees returned in the last 6 hours from the first 6 hours, and also 60 bees left in the third 6 hours, so the bees returning from the third 6 hours is not relevant, but the bees that left in the second 6 hours is relevant, 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, but 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, so there are 15 bees from the first 6 hours that returned in the last 6 hours, and also all the bees that left in the second 6 hours returned, the problem doesn't mention any bees leaving in the second 6 hours, only returning, so there are no bees that left in the second 6 hours, but the bees that returned in the second 6 hours is 15, and the problem states every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, so the bees that returned in the second 6 hours must have left in the second 6 hours, so there are 15 bees that left in the second 6 hours and returned in the second 6 hours, and also 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and returned in the last 6 hours, and the 15 bees that left in the second 6 hours and returned in the second 6 hours also returned in the last 6 hours, because they left before the last 6 hours and returned before the last 6 hours, but the problem states every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, so the 15 bees that left in the second 6 hours and returned in the second 6 hours must also return in the last 6 hours, but this is not possible in reality, but according to the problem, it is, so we must consider it, so there are 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and returned in the last 6 hours, and also 15 bees that left in the second 6 hours and returned in the second 6 hours and also returned in the last 6 hours, so the total number of bees that returned in"

Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?","To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes for each type of bill.

1. Gas bill: He writes a check for the gas bill every month, so that's 12 checks per year.
2. Pest and lawn service: He writes a check for this service quarterly, so that's 4 checks per year.
3. Electric bill: He writes a check for the electric bill every month, so that's 12 checks per year.
4. Church: He writes a check to the church twice per month, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks Buford writes per year:
12 (gas bill) + 4 (pest and lawn service) + 12 (electric bill) + 24 (church) = 52

However, the problem statement also mentions that Buford writes many checks every year, but it doesn't provide a specific number for those checks.

If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total fees he paid and subtract them from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, we calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","Let's break down the information given:

1. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
2. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
3. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.

The combined howling time of Tobias and Chikote is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

Now, we need to find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls. 

The combined howling time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).

120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the outfit.

The shirt originally costs $25, but there is a 30% off sale. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $25 * 0.30 = $7.50. So the discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The pair of shorts costs $35. Since there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, we will use the original price.

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt price and the shorts price: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

However, Joe only has $50 to spend, which is less than the total cost of the outfit. To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has: $50 - $52.50. Since the result will be negative, we know Joe doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit.

But to answer the question, we can say Joe will be short of money. So he won't have any money left but will be short $2.50 instead.

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was 20 * $20 = $400. She then got $2 off with the voucher, making the final price $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * $30 = $600. With a 10% discount, the amount deducted from the total cost is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. Therefore, the final price Sheila paid was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold.

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. Since there are two middle shelves, they can hold a total of 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books one bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

She had 9 stacking rings, 31 building blocks, and 8 stuffed animals. 

So, the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is: 
9 (stacking rings) + 31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) = 48 toys.

After buying the bouncy balls, the total number of toys is 62.

How many calories is the omelet?,"To calculate the total calories of the omelet, we need to calculate the calories of each ingredient separately and then add them together.

The omelet has 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet also has 2 oz of cheese, and cheese is 120 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet has an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Ham is 40 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?,"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets separately and then add them together.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, but since it's a busy weekend, the price is 20% more expensive. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the original price.

20% of $1500 is 0.20 x $1500 = $300
New price per day = $1500 + $300 = $1800

Since Tom and his wife are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is:
$1800 per day x 3 days = $5400

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is:
$5000 x 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets to find the total cost of the trip:
$5400 (hotel) + $10,000 (plane tickets) = $15,400

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so Mark earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

How many friends can she invite?","To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person. 

The total cost per person is the cost of a round of mini-golf ($5) plus the cost of arcade tokens ($5) plus the cost of two go-kart rides (2 * $10 = $20). 
So, the total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?","There are 12 team members and each team member brings 2 guests, so there are 12 team members * 2 guests per team member = 24 guests.
There are also 3 coaches. In total, there are 12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people.
Each pizza will serve 3 people, so Maddy will need to buy 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.
Each pizza costs $15, so Maddy will spend 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

68,"Mrs. Cruz saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?","To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the selling price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee, which is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

69,"A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. Last week, on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.","To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to determine how many articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5 * 5 = 2. So she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now we can calculate the total number of articles written over the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

70,"Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to first calculate the total points collected by each student.

Adam has collected 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So Betty collected 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now we can add up all the points collected by the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 
400 - 255 = 145 points.

71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the store as 'x' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. We know that x + y = 17, because Bob bought 17 fish.

We also know that initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. After adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

Let's set up an equation to represent this. The total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x. The total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 3 + y. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3 + y = 8 + 2x

Now, we can substitute y = 17 - x (from the first equation) into this equation:

3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtract 8 from both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

72,"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?","To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we first need to determine how many stickers he collected this year. 

Since Leo collected 50 stickers last year, and he collected twice as many stickers this year as the previous year, he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers this year.

We know that Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Adding the stickers he collected last year and this year to his original collection, we can find the total number of stickers he has now.

So, Leo has 100 (original stickers) + 50 (stickers collected last year) + 100 (stickers collected this year) = 250 stickers.

73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers during their 10-hour shift. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 6 toys/hour * 2 workers = 12 toys/hour. 
In a 10-hour shift, they will produce 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 4 toys/hour * 2 workers = 8 toys/hour. 
In a 10-hour shift, they will produce 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

So, the first 4 workers will produce a total of 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys during their 10-hour shift.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The fifth worker's production can be found by subtracting the total production of the first 4 workers from the total production of all 5 workers. 
So, the fifth worker produces 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys in a 10-hour shift.

To find the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked. 
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys / hour.

Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final bill and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total cost including the tip, delivery fee, and the 25% vendor fee.

First, we add the tip to the original bill: $40.00 + $4.00 = $44.00

Next, we calculate the 25% vendor fee: 25% of $44.00 is 0.25 * $44.00 = $11.00

Now, we add the vendor fee and the delivery fee to the total: $44.00 + $11.00 + $3.00 = $58.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.00.

How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?,"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to determine the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass.

The total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions.

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly.

76,Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"To calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of the jar is:

Volume = length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with an efficiency of 80%, we can calculate the effective volume of the jar:

Effective Volume = 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar by dividing the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean:

Total Jelly Beans = Effective Volume / Volume of a Jelly Bean
= 432 / 0.15
= 2880 jelly beans

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans:

Estimated Red Jelly Beans = Total Jelly Beans * 0.3
= 2880 * 0.3
= 864 jelly beans

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we can calculate the difference between the estimated and actual numbers:

Difference = Actual Number - Estimated Number
= 900 - 864
= 36

Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?","To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's call the number of white carnations x. Then, 5x = 200. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 200/5 = 40.

So Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. 

We also know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Since she ordered 40 white carnations, she must have ordered 4 x 40 = 160 red roses.

However, we don't know how many red roses were delivered, so we can't determine how many more red roses need to be delivered. But since the question asks for the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, and we know that Sandra ordered 160 red roses, we can assume that none were delivered.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

78,Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.  One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches. 

One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

So, the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate is 28 - 16 = 12.

Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, which contain 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 12 + 12 = 24.

After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. The friend's house is 200 miles away. How long did the trip take?,"To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for the trip to John's friend's house and the time taken for the trip back home.

The distance to John's friend's house was originally 200 miles, but a detour added 10 miles, making the total distance 200 + 10 = 210 miles. Since John drives at 70 mph, the time taken to reach his friend's house is 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

The distance from John's friend's house back home is 240 miles, and John drives at 80 mph. The time taken for the trip back home is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

The total time of the trip is the sum of the time taken for the trip to John's friend's house and the time taken for the trip back home, which is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","To solve this problem, we need to first find the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and then compare them.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of the savings came from the jogger jeans, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2.

This means that the jogger jeans were originally priced at $22 + $2 = $24.

The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 * $6 = $4, came from the tattered jeans. So, the tattered jeans were originally priced at $28 + $4 = $32.

However, the question asks for the difference between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. The jogger jeans originally cost $24 and the tattered jeans originally cost $32. 

The difference is $32 - $24 = $8, but the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost less, the answer will be negative, but we can interpret it as the jogger jeans costing $8 less.

However, the question specifically asks for how much more the jogger jeans cost. Therefore, the answer is the negative of the actual difference.

81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","To find out how much money John had leftover after paying debt, we first need to calculate the amount of the loan he received. Since the loan is worth 40% of his house, and his house is worth $250,000, we can calculate the loan amount as follows:

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 x $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we need to find out how much of the loan amount John used to pay off his debts. Since he used 60% of the loan amount for debt repayment, we can calculate the amount used for debt repayment as follows:

Amount used for debt repayment = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 x $100,000
= $60,000

Finally, to find out how much money John had leftover after paying debt, we subtract the amount used for debt repayment from the loan amount:

Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used for debt repayment
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","To find the final temperature of the room, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract the warming effect when it was turned off.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low, so for 3 hours, it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees an hour. So, for 4 hours, it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at 2 degrees an hour. So, for 2 hours, it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the total cooling effect minus the warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to first find her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand.

Millie spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue is 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36.

Her profit is her total revenue minus her cost, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand, so her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The first friend says 80 jelly beans.

The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on the other days and subtract it from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night, so that's 2 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

So, the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 90 minutes / 30 minutes/episode = 3 episodes.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, which is a total of 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, she will see 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks from the city.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is the number of fireworks from the city that she can see (120) plus the number of fireworks set off in her backyard (15), which is 120 + 15 = 135.

92,"Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of wool required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren.

For each grandchild, Martha wants to make:
- A hat, which requires 2 skeins of wool
- A scarf, which requires 4 skeins of wool
- A sweater, which requires 12 skeins of wool
- A pair of mittens, which requires 1 skein of wool
- A pair of socks, which requires 2 skeins of wool

So, for each grandchild, the total amount of wool required is:
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins of wool

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, the total amount of wool required is:
21 skeins per grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 63 skeins of wool

Therefore, Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool to make the desired winter wear for her 3 grandchildren.

93,"Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. Each student earns the same amount.  How much did each student raise?","The charity raised a total of $175,000. Of this amount, $50,000 came from organizations. So the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

There are 20 students, and each student raised the same amount. To find the amount raised by each student, we divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So each student raised $6,250.

94,"Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  He lost 10 bills while getting home.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?","To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the steps he took with his money.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is worth $20, we can calculate the number of bills he initially has:
$1000 / $20 = 50 bills

After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Since he hasn't lost any bills yet, he still has 50 bills. Half of 50 is 25, so he uses 25 bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:
50 - 25 = 25 bills

Then, Thomas triples his money. This means he now has three times the amount of money he had before. Since he had 25 bills, each worth $20, he had $500. Tripling this amount gives him:
$500 * 3 = $1500

Since the value of each bill is still $20, we can calculate the new number of bills he has:
$1500 / $20 = 75 bills

Next, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. This doesn't change the total amount of money he has, just the denomination of the bills. Since he now has $1500 in 5 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of 5 dollar bills he has:
$1500 / $5 = 300 bills

Finally, Thomas lost 10 bills while getting home. This means he now has:
300 - 10 = 290 bills

95,"Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?","To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then subtract the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, taking into account that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

However, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should aim to arrive at the theater in 4 - 5 = -1 minute (relative to Wayne's arrival time). In other words, Bernadette should aim to arrive 1 minute before the time it would take Wayne to arrive if he left at the same time as Bernadette.

Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she wants to arrive 1 minute before the time it would take Wayne to arrive if he left at the same time as Bernadette, we can calculate the time difference between Bernadette's departure time and Wayne's departure time.

To arrive 1 minute before the time it would take Wayne to arrive if he left at the same time as Bernadette, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before the premiere.

However, since the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, we should subtract the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater from the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater, taking into account that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before the premiere, and since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should leave 17 - 4 = 13 minutes before Wayne.

However, a more straightforward approach would be to simply subtract the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater from the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then add the 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne, but since the 4 minutes is the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater and has already been accounted for in the 16 minutes it takes Bernadette to get to the theater, we can simply subtract 4 minutes from the 16 minutes and then add the 5 minutes.

A more straightforward approach would be 16 - 4 = 12, and then add the 5 minutes, but the 5 minutes is the time Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne, so the correct calculation is 16 - 4 = 12 + 5 - 4 = 16 - 4 + 5 - 4 = 13.

However, this calculation is still incorrect, the correct calculation would be 16 - 4 = 12, and the 5 minutes should be added to the 12 minutes.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we need to first determine the number of trees he planted on the first and second days.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, on the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than he planted on the first day. So, he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, on the second day, Mr. Julius planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the number of trees he planted on the first and second days. 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. 

On the first day, Arnold stole half of the bananas, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. So, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

On the second day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold stole 12 bananas later that evening, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther counted the bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year, multiply it by the cost per mile, and then add the total bonus paid per year.

John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total number of days he goes to work per year is 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 250 days/year.

Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day.

The total miles driven per year is 60 miles/day * 250 days/year = 15,000 miles/year.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for miles driven per year is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

The total amount John pays for driving per year is the sum of the total cost for miles driven and the total bonus paid: $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

99,"Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","To solve this problem, we need to work backwards to find out how many cookies Henry baked last year.

Let's start with the fact that Henry has 110 cookies after dropping 5. This means that before he dropped the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We also know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, if we subtract 15 from the total number of cookies he had before dropping any, we can find out how many cookies he originally intended to bake. 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

The problem states that Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. If he intended to bake 100 cookies this year, and that's twice as many as last year, then we can divide 100 by 2 to find out how many cookies he baked last year. 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?","To find the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then add those amounts together.

The second player ate beef tips, which contained 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. So, the second player ate 8 ounces of meat.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, which means they did not eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the amount of meat each player ate: 8 ounces (second player) + 6 ounces (first player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.

If he chooses the 24-hour option, he will pay 1600 pesos.

If he chooses the 12-hour option, he will pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. He will then have to pay for 5 additional hours (17 - 12 = 5). Each additional hour costs 70 pesos, so he will pay 5 x 70 = 350 pesos for the additional hours.

The total cost for the 12-hour option with additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we subtract 15 from the total number of cups to find out how many cups were used for chamomile and mint tea.

Total cups = 27
Cups used for cinnamon tea = 15
Cups used for chamomile and mint tea = 27 - 15 = 12

Since the cups used for chamomile and mint tea are divided equally between the two types of tea, we divide 12 by 2 to find out the total number of cups used for mint tea.

Total cups used for mint tea = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we know that Lana divided the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we divide the total number of cups used for mint tea by 3.

Cups of mint tea in each row = 6 / 3 = 2

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs and then subtract the amount already given.

Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed already given is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

To find out how much feed is left to be given in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios that might occur.

First, let's consider the case where the normal teacher comes in. There's a 40% chance that she'll give everyone an extension, which means there's a 60% chance (100% - 40%) that she won't give an extension. If she doesn't give an extension, Marcus still has a 20% chance of convincing her that his dog ate his assignment and getting a personal extension. This means that the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is 60% * (100% - 20%) = 60% * 80% = 48%.

However, there's only a 50% chance that the normal teacher will come in tomorrow. There's a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. If this happens, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

So, the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework tomorrow is the probability of the normal teacher coming in and Marcus having to turn in his homework, which is 50% * 48% = 24%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"To find the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end, we need to calculate the number of large and small buttons she receives from trading her stickers.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 x 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she receives 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she receives 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 x 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, and three small buttons are worth one large button, she can trade 27 small stickers for 27/3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, let's add up the total number of buttons Lorraine has:

- 20 large buttons from trading 50% of her large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers
- 9 large buttons from trading 90% of her small stickers
- 3 small stickers were not traded (10% of 30), and she can trade them for 3 small buttons.

Since 3 small buttons are worth one large button, we can convert the total number of small buttons to large buttons by dividing by 3. However, in this problem, we are asked for the total number of buttons, not just large buttons, so we will keep the small buttons as they are.

In total, Lorraine has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

113,44 seniors need to receive awards.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, but there is an additional 20% cost for etching the logo. 20% of $20 is $4, so the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $24 = $1056.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which means 44 / 4 = 11 seniors are officers. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

3 pen pals * 2 letters per pen pal per week * 5 pages per letter = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing in a week is:
30 pages per week * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes per week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the total time Mike spends writing in a week from minutes to hours as follows:
180 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours per week.

115,Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?,"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we first need to calculate how long it will take him to read the book.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes to read the book.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so he needs to leave his current location in 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Since it will take Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading the book in 30 minutes and then leave for the airport. This means he will leave 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.

116,Mr. Marcellus realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. A company had sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.,"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we first need to calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date. 

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we can calculate the amount of sour milk as follows:
2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

The cost of the milk was $3.5 per gallon. To find the total refund, we multiply the amount of sour milk by the cost per gallon:
1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600.

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

117,"Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. His soup serves 6 people. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)","To calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to first calculate the total cost of the ingredients.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are also on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to calculate the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

The answer is {2}."
118,"Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?","To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the mixture, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and subtract it from the total revenue.

The cost of ingredients for 1 jar is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost of ingredients for 1 jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, the profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
$6 per jar * 10 jars = $60.

119,"Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. On the seventh day, he wasn't traveling at all. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?","To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in the first week and the second week separately.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first week (6 days) is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom didn't travel on the 7th day, the total distance traveled in the first week remains the same.

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip by adding the distance traveled in the first week and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

120,"Glue sticks come in packs of 8. Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for all students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 2 glue sticks per student * 27 students = 54 glue sticks.

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to find out how many packs are needed to cover 54 glue sticks. We can do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs.

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number of packs. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

122,There are 3 classes. Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school and then find the number of girls in the third class.

Since there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Each pizza had 12 slices. How many slices of pizza were left?,"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we first need to determine how many slices each group of friends ate.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 friends in this group, and each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 2/3 * 12 * 3 = 24 slices of pizza in total. However, they had 3 pizzas with 12 slices each, so they had 12 * 3 = 36 slices of pizza. Since they ate 24 slices, they had 36 - 24 = 12 slices of pizza left.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends in this group, and each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 3/4 * 12 * 2 = 18 slices of pizza in total. However, they had 2 pizzas with 12 slices each, so they had 12 * 2 = 24 slices of pizza. Since they ate 18 slices, they had 24 - 18 = 6 slices of pizza left.

In total, the friends had 12 + 6 = 18 slices of pizza left.

124,"James buys a plane. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. The plane cost $150,000. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?","To find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the monthly costs and add them to the initial cost of the plane.

The monthly cost of renting a hanger is $5000. James also spends twice as much on fuel per month, which is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since James needs to pay this amount for 12 months in the first year, the total cost for the year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane ($150,000) to the total maintenance cost for the first year ($180,000), we get the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year.

Total cost = $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (maintenance cost) = $330,000.

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?","James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, so he needed 8 more toys. In total, he needed 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

However, when James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there were 8 x 2 = 16 more dogs, in addition to the original 12 dogs. So, the total number of dogs became 12 + 16 = 28 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 28 toys in total. But when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed 3 toys. Therefore, James needed 28 - 3 = 25 toys.

How many trees does he have left?,"Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees per year for 10 years, so he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees. This brings his total to 50 + 100 = 150 trees.

However, 30% of his trees die after 10 years. 30% of 150 is 0.3 * 150 = 45 trees. So, he loses 45 trees due to death.

Additionally, he chops down 2 trees per year for 10 years, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

So, his total number of trees left is 150 - 45 - 20 = 85 trees.

130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we first need to determine how many goats were sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm:

In Farm X, there were originally 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, there are 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.

In Farm Y, there were originally 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, there are 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm:

45 goats (from Farm X) + 25 goats (from Farm Y) = 70 goats.

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

How much does he make?","To find out how much John makes, we first need to calculate the number of logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

John sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount of money he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese and serves 4 people. To serve 20 people, we need to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of meat would be 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of cheese would be 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost of meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people would be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each person found and then subtract that total from the total number of eggs hidden.

First, we know that Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we can add up the total number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs, we can subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find out how many eggs are still hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to determine the total weight of the crayons and then add the weight of the boxes.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

To convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since 1 pound = 16 ounces):

200 ounces / 16 = 12.5 pounds

Now, let's find the number of boxes needed to hold all the crayons. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

200 crayons / 8 = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Converting the weight of the boxes from ounces to pounds, we get:

200 ounces / 16 = 12.5 pounds

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the total weight:

12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes) = 25 pounds

He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2. How much did everything cost?,"To calculate the total cost of the coffee and the donut, we first need to find out the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate the cost per pound as follows:

Cost per pound of normal brand = $5
Increase in cost = 20% of $5 = 0.2 * $5 = $1
Cost per pound of more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he wants to buy a week's worth of coffee, he needs to buy 7 pounds of coffee.

Cost of 7 pounds of more expensive coffee = 7 * $6 = $42

In addition to the coffee, Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

Total cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of donut = $42 + $2 = $44

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Let's break down the information given:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

To find the total number of shirts, we add the number of students in each size category:

He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?","To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and how much he has left.

Colby spent $10 per ticket for 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, which is $10 x 5 = $50.
He spent $7 per ticket for 8 movies on other days, which is $7 x 8 = $56.
He spent $8 per tub of popcorn for 2 tubs, which is $8 x 2 = $16.
He spent $2 per box of candy for 4 boxes, which is $2 x 4 = $8.

In total, Colby has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130 so far.

Since his parents give him $150 per month, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

However, Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy tonight, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10.
So, he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left after buying the popcorn and candy.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. Therefore, Colby can only see 1 more movie with the remaining money.

How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is $6.50?","To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is a total of $0.50. So, the total cost of the burrito with extras is:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which adds chips and a drink. So, the total cost of the meal is:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad uses a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this amount from the total cost:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00.

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar and twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt and sugar is 2x. 

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10.

Combine like terms: 10x = 10.

If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?","To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil they have left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

The sunflowers require 3 pounds of soil each, and they planted 4 sunflowers. So, the sunflowers used 3 pounds per sunflower * 4 sunflowers = 12 pounds of soil.

The carnations require 1.5 pounds of soil each, and they planted 10 carnations. So, the carnations used 1.5 pounds per carnation * 10 carnations = 15 pounds of soil.

In total, the sunflowers and carnations used 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds of soil.

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. After planting the sunflowers and carnations, they have 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds of soil left.

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. So, with 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound per rose = 3 roses.

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to first calculate the number of people on the bus after the third station.

The bus initially had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station (40) entered the bus. This is 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, making it 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus can be filled by 200 - 180 = 20 people.

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?","To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to first determine the points scored by Julie in the first game. 

Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, and Sasha scored 14 points, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can find the total points scored by Sasha in both games by adding the points scored in the first and second games. 

Total points scored by Sasha = 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

144,"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?","To find the total number of guests attending the party, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, and then subtract the number of people who said they could not come.

Total number of guests = 25 classmates + 7 dance class members + 13 family members - 4 people who cannot come
Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4
Total number of guests = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests attending the party, which is 21 more than the initial 20, we need to calculate the additional cost.

Additional cost = 21 additional guests * $6 per guest
Additional cost = 21 * 6
Additional cost = $126

The total cost of the party will be the initial fee plus the additional cost.

Total cost = $125 (initial fee) + $126 (additional cost)
Total cost = $251

145,"Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","To calculate the profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 x $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 x $16 = $80.
The total cost of the leftover lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months, the selling price of each board will be 150% of the original cost (100% + 50% increase).

The selling price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board will be $10 x 1.5 = $15.
The selling price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board will be $16 x 1.5 = $24.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 x $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 x $24 = $120.
The total selling price of the leftover lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: $270 - $180 = $90.

146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"Crista has 20 plants in total. 4 of her plants need half a cup of water, which is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water. The rest of the plants, which is 20 - 4 = 16 plants, need a quarter of a cup of water. This is 16 * 0.25 = 4 cups of water. 

However, we are also given that 8 plants need 1 cup of water. Since we don't know which 8 plants these are, we can't simply add this to the previous total. Instead, we should calculate how much water the 8 plants that need 1 cup would require if they followed the original rules, and subtract that from the original total. 

The 8 plants would have included some plants that need half a cup and some plants that need a quarter of a cup. Let's assume the 4 plants that need half a cup are part of the 8 plants. That leaves 4 plants that need a quarter of a cup. These 4 plants would need 4 * 0.25 = 1 cup of water if they followed the original rules. The 4 plants that need half a cup would need 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water if they followed the original rules. 

So, the 8 plants would need 1 cup + 2 cups = 3 cups of water if they followed the original rules. However, we know that these 8 plants actually need 1 cup of water each, for a total of 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water. 

To find the total amount of water needed, we should subtract the amount of water the 8 plants would need if they followed the original rules (3 cups) from the original total (2 cups + 4 cups = 6 cups), and then add the amount of water the 8 plants actually need (8 cups). 

This gives us 6 cups - 3 cups + 8 cups = 11 cups of water.

And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","To find the height of the fourth child, we need to start with the height of the first child and then calculate the heights of the other children based on the given information.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

149,"A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?","To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Friday and Thursday.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at a rate of $40 per tire. So, the total revenue for Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at a rate of $60 per tire and 4 car tires at a rate of $40 per tire. So, the total revenue for Thursday is (6 * $60) + (4 * $40) = $360 + $160 = $520.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

151,"Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we first need to determine how many of each type of bike he sold.

We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find out how many BMX bikes were sold, we need to calculate 15% of 300. This is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. We know that 150 were Trekking bikes and 45 were BMX bikes, so the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now that we know how many of each type of bike Marcel sold, we can calculate how much he earned from selling them.

The price of one MTB is $500, so the total amount earned from selling MTB bikes is 105 * $500 = $52,500.

The price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, so it is $500 / 2 = $250. The total amount earned from selling BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $11,250.

The price of one Trekking bike is $450, so the total amount earned from selling Trekking bikes is 150 * $450 = $67,500.

To find the total amount earned from selling all the bikes, we add up the amounts earned from each type of bike: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?,"Let's start by identifying the number of medals Ali has, which is 22. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have a total of 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 x 39 = 390.

One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the price of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, let's find the price of a banana. Since an apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much, the price of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, let's find the price of an orange. Since an orange costs three times as much as a banana, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total price of each type of fruit in a crate:

- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6

Previously, when she started walking to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. At this time, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?","To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into school, we need to first determine how many balloons of each color she had left.

She started with 25 red balloons, but 40% of them burst. To find 40% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, and she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

She also started with 12 yellow balloons but accidentally released half of them. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons and had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

The number of green balloons didn't change, so she still had 7 green balloons.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons. She found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

In total, Sally carried 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 blue balloons into the school. 

15 + 6 + 7 + 6 = 34

He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we first need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class during the week.

There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. However, John has to take 2 extra classes a day, so he has 8 classes per day. 

8 classes * 40 minutes per class = 320 minutes per day

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total number of minutes he spends in class during the week is:

320 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1600 minutes per week

In addition to his class time, John also spends extra time learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday, which is:

1/16 * 1600 minutes per week = 100 minutes per day

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time he spends learning is:

100 minutes per day * 2 days per week = 200 minutes per week

The total number of minutes John spends learning per week is the sum of his class time and his extra learning time:

1600 minutes per week + 200 minutes per week = 1800 minutes per week

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

1800 minutes per week / 60 = 30 hours per week

If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","To find the required score on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score from the first five tests, which is 71.

The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86. We will add these scores and the unknown score on the sixth test, then divide by 5 (since we are removing one score).

Let x be the score on the sixth test. The total score is:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x = 367 + x

We want the average to be 93, so we set up the equation:
(367 + x) / 5 = 93

Multiply both sides by 5:
367 + x = 465

Subtract 367 from both sides:
x = 98

So, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the number of bandages they had left at the end of the third day.

On the third day, the nurses ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They only used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 more bandages at the end of the third day than they had at the beginning of the third day.

On the second day, the nurses used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. They used 38 bandages on the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages, which is 50 bandages.

Let's work backwards to find the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day:

- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.
- At the beginning of the third day, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages.
- At the end of the second day, they had 3 + 25 = 28 bandages (since they used 25 bandages on the third day).
- At the beginning of the second day, they had 28 + 28 = 56 bandages (since they used 28 bandages on the second day).
- At the end of the first day, they had 56 + 38 = 94 bandages (since they used 38 bandages on the first day).
- At the beginning of the first day, they had 94 - 50 = 44 bandages (since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day).

The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each additional feature and add them to the base price of the truck.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

The total cost of the additional features is $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.

Adding this to the base price of the truck, we get $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","To find out who will win the race and by how much time, we need to calculate how long it takes each person to get home.

First, let's convert the distances to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Now, let's calculate how long it takes each person to get home.

Tim rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to get home.

Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it will take him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes to get home.

Since Steve takes less time to get home, he will win the race. To find out how long he will be waiting for Tim, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

163,It takes Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"To find out how much water the boat had taken on, we first need to determine how far Julia had to row to get to shore. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can calculate her rowing speed as 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, Julia had to row for 64 seconds. At a speed of 1.25 feet per second, she would cover a distance of 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Now, we know that the boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. To find out how much water the boat had taken on, we can divide the total distance rowed (80 feet) by 10 feet and multiply by 2 liters.

80 feet / 10 feet = 8
8 * 2 liters = 16 liters

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","Let's start by analyzing the information given. We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. We also know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

We are also told that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we need to subtract the amount that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total amount.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds, so together they can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Subtracting this from the total amount of 11,600 pounds gives us:

They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2, resulting in a net gain of 8 - 2 = 6 holes.
- The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
- It is stated that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there must be 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week, we can assume that all 315 bananas are eaten by the monkeys in 7 days.

We are given that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Let's denote the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day as x. Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315, we can set up the following equation:

(10 + 14 + x) * 7 = 315

Combine the constants:

(24 + x) * 7 = 315

Divide both sides by 7:

24 + x = 45

Subtract 24 from both sides:

x = 21

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, which means it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, he has to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines for the second scene.

The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, which means it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 108 * 1/3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to calculate how many pieces of straw were given to the hamsters and the rabbits, and then subtract that from the total number of pieces of straw to find out how many were given to the rats.

The hamsters are given 5 pieces of straw each, and there are 10 cages of hamsters. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 5 pieces per hamster * 10 hamsters = 50 pieces.

The rabbits are given a total of 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces.

Since 160 pieces of straw were distributed in total, the number of pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90 pieces.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

169,"Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we first need to determine how many medium-sized jelly beans he can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 3 times the number of medium-sized beans he can eat. So, he can eat 3 * 150 = 450 small jelly beans.

The sales assistant told Erika that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. The laptop Erika wants costs $600. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate how much money she already has and how much she needs to buy the laptop.

The laptop costs $600, but Erika gets a $200 discount for trading in her old laptop. So, the price she needs to pay is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika's mom gives her $80, and she earns $150 from her part-time job. So, the total amount of money she has from these sources is $80 + $150 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she has in her purse:

$230 (money from mom and job) + x (money in purse) = $400 (price of laptop) - $50 (extra money needed)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$230 + x = $350

Subtracting $230 from both sides, we get:

x = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. How fast does the faster car go?,"To find the speed of the fastest car, we first need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which can go 120 miles per hour. 

So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

So, the speed of the fastest car is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit made on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 per car.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made is $17,500 * 10 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

174,Jello is currently on sale for $1.25.  A three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups.  Greg wants to make small jello cups for his son's outdoor birthday party. There will be 30 kids and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have 4 jello cups. How much will he spend on jello?,"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we first need to calculate how many jello cups he needs to make. Since there will be 30 kids at the party and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups.

Since a 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box. This gives us 120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Greg will spend on jello by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box. The price per box is $1.25, so the total amount spent will be 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?,"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah's grandma and Mariah used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?","To find the total amount Daniel needs to spend, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items he wants to buy before the discount.

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of the total cost: 10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?","To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to determine how many apples she picked on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples picked on Monday and that she got $56 from selling them. Since each apple is sold for $4, we can find out how many apples she sold by dividing the total amount of money she got by the price of each apple.

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total amount of money / Price of each apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is Tuesday. Therefore, she picked 2 x 12 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

To find out the total number of apples she picked over the three days, we add the number of apples she picked each day:

Total number of apples = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. So, its height at the end of the second week is 2 * 3 = 6 inches.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. In addition to these, she already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. So, the total number of potted plants she had before receiving the new ones is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, the total number of potted plants she has is 80 (initial plants) + 18 (new plants) = 98.

Feeling generous, Mary has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 potted plants.

One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants.

We are told that one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Since there are 100 plants in total, the number of indoor plants is 100 * 1/4 = 25.

This means that the remaining plants, which are not indoor plants, are 100 - 25 = 75.

Among these non-indoor plants, two-thirds are outdoor plants, and the rest are flowering plants. So, the number of outdoor plants is 2/3 * 75 = 50.

Now, to find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the total number of non-indoor plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

How much will this cost her?","To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine how many items are included in the initial installation and how many additional items need to be installed.

The initial installation includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves (Angela doesn't have any shelves, so this doesn't apply to her)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 more than the initial installation)
- 2 chandeliers (1 more than the initial installation)
- 20 pictures (10 more than the initial installation)

So, Angela needs to pay extra for:
- 2 mirrors
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The total number of additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. The cost of each additional item is $15.00.

The total cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The area of one bedroom is the length times the width, which is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?,"To find out how much Tim spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the fireworks.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, which is $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of these two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on these packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 20% of $1200 is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

So, the discounted price of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Additionally, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150. Therefore, the total amount he spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, each of John's classes has a capacity of 120 * 1/8 = 15 students.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of John's school and Ali's school. 

The combined capacity is 30 (John's school) + 120 (Ali's school) = 150 students.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first find out how much Suzie paid for the green apple gum. We know that she paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum. Since the grape gum cost $2, the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum: $2 + $1 = $3. We know that Suzie paid a total of $7 for all four packs of gum. So, if we subtract the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum from the total, we'll be left with the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each, so 30 x $50 = $1500

The total value of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs x $1800 per pack = $5400.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. 

In the second month, she collected three times the number of cards she had initially. Three times the initial number is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month doesn't make sense because the problem states that she collected 3 times the initial amount in the second month and the initial amount in the first month. However, if we consider the problem is referring to the first month as the month after the initial amount and the second month as the month after that, we can assume that the first month refers to the month she collected 60 cards. So, in the first month, she collected 60 cards and in the second month (considering the first month as the month she collected 60 cards), she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

However, if we consider the problem as per the statement that in the second month she collected 3 times the initial amount, then in the first month after the initial amount, she collected some cards, and in the second month, she collected 60 cards.

However, considering the statement ""In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month"" is referring to the month she collected 60 cards as the second month and the month before that as the first month, then let's consider the cards she collected in the first month as x.

Then in the second month, she collected x - 20 cards, which is equal to 60 cards as per the statement ""In the second month, she collected three times that number"". 

So, x - 20 = 60, then x = 80.

Now we know that Elaine collected 80 cards in the first month, and in the second month, she collected 60 cards.

The combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months is 80 + 60 = 140 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. Twice the combined number is 2 * 140 = 280 cards.

The total number of cards Elaine has now is the sum of the cards she initially had, the cards she collected in the first month, the cards she collected in the second month, and the cards she collected in the third month.

Total cards = 20 (initial) + 80 (first month) + 60 (second month) + 280 (third month) = 440.

The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time it takes for the first three trains to arrive and leave the station.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. This means it will leave the station 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. This third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.

If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green, blue, and total non-yellow cars.

The rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up the number of non-yellow cars: 12 red cars + 10 green cars + 30 blue cars = 52 non-yellow cars.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, we can subtract the number of non-yellow cars to find the number of yellow cars: 75 total cars - 52 non-yellow cars = 23 yellow cars.

194,"Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?","To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs on each of these days.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs she removed is:
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

To find the average number of Junebugs she removes per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60

195,Larry loves taking care of animals.  He has 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  How many pets does Larry have?,"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to determine the number of each type of pet.

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, we add up the number of each type of pet to find the total number of pets:

3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47

The answer is {47}."
196,"Melanie's mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks.

If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?","Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks, so she has saved a total of 10 toothpicks per week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

She needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, so she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, she will need 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks per week = 8 weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?","The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and half price for the second T-shirt ($8 * 0.5 = $4). The total cost of the two T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The original price of the shoes is $40. Since the shoes are 40% off, Jake pays 60% of the original price ($40 * 0.6 = $24).

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.   How many lollipops does Oscar have?","Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

At school, he gives 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends at school, which is 2 x 14 = 28 lollipops. So, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Of the people who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. How many people accept the position?","To find out how many people accept the position, we need to calculate the number of people who receive interviews, then the number of people who receive job offers, and finally the number of people who accept the position.

First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people who applied receive interviews, we can calculate this as:

100 * 0.30 = 30 people

Next, let's calculate the number of people who receive job offers. Since 20% of the people who receive interviews receive job offers, we can calculate this as:

30 * 0.20 = 6 people

Finally, let's calculate the number of people who accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive job offers accept the position, we can calculate this as:

6 * (1/3) = 2 people

Therefore, 2 people accept the position.

200,"Mr. Rogers sold a watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it.  The watch was originally $2000, but was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch was $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
120% of $1500 = 1.2 * $1500 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price. The original price was $2000, and Mr. Roger's friend bought it for $1800. The discount is:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

201,"James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the time spent swimming the first 60% of the distance, the time spent resting on the island, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance.

First, let's find the distance James swam at his normal pace. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, the distance he swam is:
20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time he spent swimming the first 60% of the distance is:
12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Next, James rests on the island for half as long as the swimming time. So, the time he spent resting is:
6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, let's find the remaining distance James needs to swim. Since he already swam 12 miles, the remaining distance is:
20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims at half his normal pace for the remaining distance, his speed is:
2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

The time he spent swimming the remaining distance is:
8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to get across the lake by adding up the time spent swimming the first 60% of the distance, the time spent resting, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance:
6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

How much money does Sally have left?","Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound costs $3 and the second pound is 1/2 off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. So the total cost of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each, which is 4 * $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50. The total amount Sally spent is $4.5 + $2.50 = $7. She started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost for the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The cost for the second venue is $25 per guest. So, the total cost for the second venue is 25x.

Now, we want to find out when the costs of the two venues are equal. We can set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve this equation, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 200/20
x = 10

So, the costs of the two venues will be equal when there are 10 guests.

If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?","To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales produced is:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales produced by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday compared to Monday. On Monday, 32 classes visited. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?","To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

We know that 32 classes visited on Monday. 
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited on Wednesday.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in all, so the sum of the balls retrieved in each set is equal to 19:

x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x + 8 = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done. The makeup artist worked 6 hours a day, 4 times a week. So, in a week, the makeup artist worked 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.

Since the movie took 5 weeks to finish, the total hours of makeup work done is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so the total cost without discount is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so the amount of discount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total cost minus the discount, which is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

212,"Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight in the backyard. At the start of the game, Maria had one water balloon for herself. Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.  At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?","Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. Then her mom came out and gave each person, including Maria, 3 more balloons. This means Maria now has 1 + 3 = 4 balloons, and each of her 4 friends has 3 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons after Maria's mom gave them out is: 
- Maria has 4 balloons.
- Each of her 4 friends has 3 balloons, so that's 4 friends * 3 balloons each = 12 balloons.
- The total number of balloons so far is 4 (Maria's) + 12 (her friends') = 16 balloons.

Then, Maria gave each of her friends 2 more water balloons. This means each friend now has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons after Maria gave some to her friends is:
- Maria still has 4 balloons (she gave some away, but the question states she gave away 2 to each friend, and it doesn't mention her giving any of her own away to have fewer than 4, it implies she had some to give away in addition to the ones she kept, but since it says 'then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons', she had 4 and was able to give 2 to each friend from the initial amount her mom gave her friends, but she kept 4 as stated above).
- However, the correct interpretation is that she had 1 balloon initially, received 3 more from her mom for a total of 4, and then she gave 2 * 4 friends = 8 balloons away to her friends from the ones her mom gave her to give away. Her mom gave her 3 to keep and extra to give away, but the amount given away doesn't affect the initial 4 she had. She had some extra balloons to give away but it is not affecting the 4 balloons she kept for herself as stated above.
- However, considering the logic of the problem and its implications, it is reasonable to deduce that the 8 balloons she gave away, were part of the initial balloons her mom gave her to give to her friends, in addition to the ones they already had. This would mean that her mom gave her a total of 4 balloons for herself (as we initially calculated) + 8 balloons for her to give away to her friends = 12 balloons to Maria. Then her friends received 3 each, so 12 for all of them, and then Maria gave them 8 more from the ones she received from her mom, in addition to the ones her mom gave them directly.
- Each of her friends now has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons, and there are 4 friends, so that's 4 friends * 5 balloons each = 20 balloons.

Since Maria has 4 balloons, and her friends have 20 balloons, the total number of balloons they have is 4 (Maria's) + 20 (her friends') = 24 balloons.

However, taking into consideration the explanation above, the problem is somewhat ambiguous in the explanation of how many balloons Maria had to give away, but based on the information provided we can calculate the total number of balloons they have in the end without considering the balloons given away by Maria's initial amount.

Maria had 1 balloon and received 3 from her mom for a total of 4, and then each friend received 3 + 2 = 5, for a total of 20 balloons for the friends, and then if we add Maria's balloons, that would be 20 + 4 = 24.

However, another possible interpretation would be that the 8 balloons Maria gave away were part of the initial amount she had after receiving 3 more from her mom. In this case, she would have had 4 balloons initially and then gave away 8, but since she can't give away more balloons than she has, this would mean that she must have received more balloons from her mom than stated, in order to have some to give away. But since the problem doesn't provide more information about this, we can't consider this possibility.

Considering the initial logic we used to solve the problem and the implications of the problem, the solution to the problem would be that the girls had a total of 24 balloons.

However, if we consider the 8 balloons Maria gave away to her friends, and the fact that she must have had those balloons to give away, the explanation of the problem changes. Since Maria received 3 balloons from her mom, in addition to the 1 she already had, for a total of 4, and then she gave away 2 balloons to each of her 4 friends, for a total of 8 balloons given away, this would mean that she had 8 extra balloons to give away in addition to the 4 she had for herself. This would mean that her mom gave her a total of 4 balloons for herself + 8"

On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to determine their current hourly salaries. 

Billy started at $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a $0.50 raise, bringing his hourly salary to $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Then, on his first anniversary, he received another $1.00 raise, bringing his hourly salary to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was, which was $10 per hour. Therefore, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much money each of them will earn if they work 20 hours. 

Billy's current hourly salary is $11.50 per hour. If he works 20 hours, he will earn $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's current hourly salary is $10.50 per hour. If she works 20 hours, she will earn $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings. $230 - $210 = $20.

How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","To find out how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the annual profit from the tree and then see how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree, so the annual profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

The tree costs $90 to plant, so we need to find out how many years it will take for the annual profit to cover this cost. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the annual profit:

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to cover the initial cost of planting the tree, and he will start earning money on the lemon tree in the 13th year.

216,Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we first need to calculate the total amount they spent on the birthday surprise.

The cake costs $11. 
One dozen balloons is 12 balloons, and since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost (12/2) * 0.5 = 6 * 0.5 = $3.
Two tubs of ice cream cost 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount they spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother, the total amount they received is 2x, where x is the amount each one of them received.

The total amount they spent is equal to the total amount they received, so 2x = $28.

To find the amount each one of them received, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = $28/2 = $14.

Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and how much money she already has.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of the shoes. The jacket costs $30 and the 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. So the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earned money from babysitting the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time. So she earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting. This means she now has $10 + $20 = $30.

Since Sara wants to buy items that cost $70 and she already has $30, she needs to earn $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide the amount she needs to earn ($40) by the amount she earns each time she mows the lawn ($4). This gives us $40 / $4 = 10 times.

The answer is {10}."
218,"A local town is expanding and wants to build several new homes across the next three years. In the first year, they will build 12 homes. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?","To determine the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year.

In the first year, they will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year. So, they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes in the second year.

In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. By the end of the second year, they will have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes. In the third year, they will double this amount, building 48 * 2 = 96 homes in the third year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years by adding the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

219,"Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?","To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of the bagel's cost, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which gives us $1. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5.

Now, we can add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) + $5 (soup) = $11.

220,"A large t-shirt is 6 square feet of fabric. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A medium t-shirt is 4 square feet of fabric. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?","To find the total area of the quilt, we need to calculate the area of each type of t-shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small t-shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium t-shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large t-shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all the t-shirts together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to determine how many laps each person can run.

We know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now that we know how many laps each person can run, we can compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps. 

Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

The answer is {5}."
222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber that yields the most sticks per dollar.

A 2 x 4 costs $4 and yields 200 sticks, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

A 2 x 8 costs $6 and yields 400 sticks, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 yields more sticks per dollar, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8s as he can with his $24 budget.

He can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

Each 2 x 8 yields 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will yield 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

223,"Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we first need to determine how many shaken and unshaken cans are left after Ellen's brother and Ellen take their sodas.

Ellen started with 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas and 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas. Ellen then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 - 1 = 6 unshaken sodas.

So, when Ellen's friend comes along, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 2 + 6 = 8.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, expressed as a percentage:

(2 shaken sodas / 8 total sodas) * 100% = 25%

224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person. 

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet. So the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet. So the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the number of people, which is 2.

Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The answer is {410}."
225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the scenario where the final temperature of the mixed water is exactly 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle, the total amount of water becomes 5 ounces.

We can use the weighted average formula to calculate the final temperature:

(4/5) * 33 + (1/5) * x = 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fractions:

4 * 33 + x = 5 * 40

132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

However, this calculation assumes that the final temperature is exactly 40 degrees. Since the problem states that Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees, the actual temperature of the second bottle could be higher than 68 degrees. 

But we are looking for the minimum temperature of the second bottle, so we consider the scenario where the final temperature is exactly 40 degrees.

The answer is {68}."
226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The initial value of the boat is $9000.

In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%. So, the value of the boat after the first year is:
$9000 - (30% of $9000) = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. So, the value of the boat after the second year is:
$6300 - (30% of $6300) = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. So, the value of the boat after the third year is:
$4410 - (20% of $4410) = $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

227,"Each student in Marissa's class started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","To find out how many pencils were left, we need to first determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since each student started with 10 pencils and there are 30 students in the class, the total number of pencils is:

10 pencils/student * 30 students = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find out how many pencils were used, we can multiply the total number of pencils by 1/5:

300 pencils * 1/5 = 60 pencils

So, 60 pencils were used after two months. To find out how many pencils were left after two months, we subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils:

300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find out how many pencils were left, we can multiply the number of pencils remaining after two months by 1/3:

240 pencils * 1/3 = 80 pencils

228,"Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to calculate the total time she spent in bed and then subtract the time she was awake.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., but that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

The total time she spent in bed is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get:
7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes
Adding the 55 minutes:
420 minutes + 55 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she was awake. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. Additionally, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, but this time is already accounted for in the sleepwalking time. However, we still need to add the 5 minutes she was awake before her usual wake-up time (from 5:55 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.). But this 5 minutes should be added to the time she was awake after she finished sleepwalking, not to the sleepwalking time. Since she was awake from 2:38 to 5:55, that is 3 hours and 17 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes
Adding the 17 minutes:
180 minutes + 17 minutes = 197 minutes
Then add the 5 minutes she woke up before her usual wake-up time and the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking:
197 minutes + 5 minutes + 23 minutes = 225 minutes

However, we only need the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up before her usual wake-up time since the rest of the time is the time she would be awake after waking up:
23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes

Now, subtract the time she was awake (28 minutes) from the total time she spent in bed (475 minutes):
475 minutes - 28 minutes = 447 minutes
