0,"Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200. After the first person bids, the price rises to $200 + $50 = $250. Carmen then bids, so the price rises to $250 + $50 = $300. After the second person bids, the price rises to $300 + $50 = $350. Carmen then bids again, so the price rises to $350 + $50 = $400. After the third person bids, the price rises to $400 + $50 = $450. Finally, Carmen bids again and wins the auction at $450 + $50 = $500.

1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the total number of games he received or bought each year.

In the first year, Steve received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 games. He also bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games that year. Therefore, in the first year, Steve had 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve again received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 games. He also bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games that year. Therefore, in the second year, Steve had 22 + 10 + 24 = 56 games.

In the third year, Steve received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 games. He also bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games that year. Therefore, in the third year, Steve had 56 + 10 + 48 = 114 games.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. To convert this to seconds, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato.

So, the total time it takes to peel and cut each potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prep, we multiply the time it takes to prep each potato by the total number of potatoes: 95 * 60 = 5700 seconds.

To convert this back to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the cost of the CDs and subtract the amount he received for selling the 5 CDs he didn't like.

First, let's calculate the cost of the CDs. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. However, he gets them for 40% off. 

To find the discount, we multiply the cost of each CD by the discount percentage: $15 * 0.40 = $6. 

So, the discount on each CD is $6. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of each CD: $15 - $6 = $9. 

Now, we multiply the discounted price by the total number of CDs: $9 * 10 = $90.

James sells 5 CDs for $40. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he received from the total cost of the CDs: $90 - $40 = $50.

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to first calculate the total number of seats, then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. One-fourth of 72 is 72 / 4 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by administrators.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by parents.

The rest of the seats were occupied by students. The number of seats occupied by students is 54 - 18 = 36.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","To find the number of miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to find the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. We are given that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day, and there are 4 dogs. 

The total number of miles all the dogs need to walk in a day is 3 miles per dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles per day.

We are given the miles the first three dogs need to walk: 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles. 

The total miles the first three dogs need to walk is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles all the dogs need to walk to find the miles the last dog needs to walk: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The company already had 4 vanilla scents available and sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company already had 8 fruity scents available and sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents.

8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of not fixing the pothole and compare it to the total cost of fixing it.

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will have to pay $450 to repair the damage to his car.

On the other hand, if Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to pay $25 per bucket of asphalt * 3 buckets = $75 for the materials. Additionally, he will be fined $120 by the city council for unauthorized road maintenance. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 + $120 = $195.

By fixing the pothole, Ron saves $450 (cost of not fixing the pothole) - $195 (cost of fixing the pothole) = $255.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the total area of the bedroom and then multiply it by the cost of removing the old carpet, installing the new carpet, and purchasing the new carpet and padding.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7344.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot * 216 square feet = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is $864 + $7344 + $2592 + $432 = $11232.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount, which is 30/2 = 15 apples, from the shortest trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathers from the average trees as x.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine the constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","To determine how many flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space available for the flowers in the flower bed. Since the flower bed is 111 feet long, and each flower takes up 1.5 feet of space (including the space between the plants), and each flower is 1 foot wide (12 inches = 1 foot), we can calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed.

First, we calculate the total space taken up by each flower: 1 foot (flower width) + 1.5 feet (space between flowers) = 2.5 feet per flower.

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed: 111 feet / 2.5 feet per flower = 44.4 flowers.

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 44 flowers.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 27 flowers * $6 per flower = $162.

The answer is {162}."
12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"To find the amount of time John spent sightseeing, we need to first find the total amount of time he spent on all activities. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. 
He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows. 

The total time spent on these events is 6 hours boating + 3 hours swimming + 6 hours watching shows = 15 hours.

Since he spent 30% of his time on these events, we can set up the equation:
30% of total time = 15 hours
0.3 * total time = 15
total time = 15 / 0.3
total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. 
We can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. These are his only expenses. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?","Kim already has 3 clients and is confident that he will get 5 more potential clients, so in total, he will have 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. The total cost for each client will be 2 * $2 (for the bleach) + $5 (for the cloths) = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, his total expenses will be 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week will be $92, and his total expenses will be $72. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them, because on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. How many people sang in the performance?","To find the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find out how many girls are in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members, 50% of which are girls, the number of girls in the choir is 52 * 0.5 = 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can perform is 26 / 2 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them, so we add 3 to the number of girls who can perform. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","To solve this problem, let's first determine how much of the chalk the teacher used on Monday. The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it. To find out how much of the chalk was used, we can multiply the total length of the chalk by the percentage used.

Length of chalk used on Monday = 5 inches * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

This means that the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Now, let's calculate how much chalk the teacher uses each day when he goes back to using only 20% of the chalk. 

Length of chalk used per day = 5 inches * 0.20 = 1 inch

However, since the teacher only has 2.75 inches of chalk left, we need to calculate how much of this remaining chalk is used each day.

Length of chalk used per day = 2.75 inches * 0.20 = 0.55 inches

Now, let's calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is smaller than 2 inches.

Since the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left and wants to know how many days he can use it before it is smaller than 2 inches, we can subtract 2 inches from the remaining chalk and divide it by the amount used per day.

Remaining chalk that can be used = 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches

Number of days = Remaining chalk that can be used / Length of chalk used per day
= 0.75 inches / 0.55 inches
= 1.36 days

However, since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

Number of days = 1 day + 1 day (for the remaining 0.36 days, since the teacher can use the chalk for another day before it is smaller than 2 inches)

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?","To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","To find out who ran the most and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is a total distance of 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards. 

Then, she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for each of these runs is 2 * 40 yards = 80 yards. So, the total distance for these runs is 80 yards * 34 = 2720 yards.

Kelly's total distance is 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times, which is a total distance of 2 * 100 yards * 15 = 3000 yards.

Since 3000 yards is greater than 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. 

The difference in the distances they ran is 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find the number of gallons needed: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","To find out how many guests the hotel has after dinner, we need to calculate the total number of guests after all the checkouts and check-ins.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests left is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but this doesn't change the number of guests at this point.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the number of guests now is:

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","To find the calorie deficit needed each day, we need to first calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit needed is 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st, so we need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th. 

January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

The total number of days is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?","To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

We know that on days four and five, Mack saw a total of 120 birds, on day six he saw 20 birds, and on day seven he saw 90 birds. So, the total number of birds he saw on these days is:

120 + 20 + 90 = 230 birds

We also know that on days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. Since he saw no birds on day three, the total number of birds he saw over the week is:

230 + 50 = 280 birds

Since there are 7 days in a week, to find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we divide the total number of birds by 7:

280 / 7 = 40

27,"Chris is way behind on his math homework. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?","To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to determine how many problems he completed in total from Monday to Wednesday.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.

On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. To find out how many problems were remaining after Tuesday, we subtract the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday from the total problems:

Total problems = 100
Problems completed on Monday and Tuesday = 12 + 36 = 48
Remaining problems after Tuesday = 100 - 48 = 52

Since Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems on Wednesday, we calculate:

Problems completed on Wednesday = 1/4 * 52 = 13

Now, let's find out how many problems Chris has completed in total from Monday to Wednesday:

Total problems completed = 12 + 36 + 13 = 61

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total problems completed from the total problems:

28,"Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Felix charges based on how high he has to climb, and every branch he has to climb up costs $0.25. He made a total of $105 during the week. 

To find the total number of branches he climbed, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total number of branches = Total amount of money / Cost per branch
Total number of branches = $105 / $0.25
Total number of branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average number of branches per day = Total number of branches / 7
Average number of branches per day = 420 / 7
Average number of branches per day = 60

29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times as many kernels popped as in the first 30 seconds. So, 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped in the next 30 seconds.

The kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate after 60 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Since the popping rate in the second 30 seconds was 60 kernels, the rate in the final 30 seconds would be half of 4 times the initial rate, which is 2 times the initial rate. The initial rate was 20 kernels in 30 seconds, so 2 times that rate is 40 kernels in 30 seconds.

However, we need to find the number of kernels that popped in the 30 seconds before the final 30 seconds. Since the popping rate increased to 4 times the initial rate after 60 seconds, the rate in the 30 seconds before the final 30 seconds would be 4 times the initial rate, which is 80 kernels in 30 seconds.

But we are given that the rate in the final 30 seconds is half the rate of the past 30 seconds. Since the rate in the final 30 seconds is 40 kernels in 30 seconds, the rate in the past 30 seconds would be 80 kernels in 30 seconds.

So, in the 30 seconds before the final 30 seconds, 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, 40 kernels popped.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 kernels is 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval:

20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

30,"An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

We are also told that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Finally, we add up the cost of all the items to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?","To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to determine how many times it rang each time it went off.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we can add up the number of times the alarm rang each time it went off to find the total number of times it rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?,"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he gave to his sister and how many pieces he chewed throughout the day.

Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum. At the end of the day, he gives half of the gum he has remaining to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives to his sister, we need to first calculate how many pieces he has remaining after a day of school.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours. So, he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum at school. He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum chewed throughout the day.

Now, we can calculate how many pieces of gum Jim has remaining before he gives some to his sister. He started with 20 pieces and chewed 6, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Jim gives half of the gum he has remaining to his sister, which is 14/2 = 7 pieces. So, he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To determine the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all the feed: 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 1300 pounds (oats) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 48 pounds (carrots) = 4500 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

The answer is {2}."

Next to Affenpinscher sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?","To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to first find the weight of the Papillon, which is one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund. 

We know that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds. So, the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, which is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, he won 2 x $5 + $1 = $11 on the second race. However, the question asks about the amount he lost, not won. So, for the second race, we don't count any loss.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, he lost 1.5 x $11 = $16.50 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $0 (second race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount he lost per race is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

The dress shirts were $60 each.  How much did everything cost?,"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.

The suits cost $750 each, and James bought 10 suits, so the total cost of the suits is:
10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500

The dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of the suits, which is:
$750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair of dress pants
James bought 10 dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is:
10 dress pants * $150 per pair = $1,500

James also bought 3 dress shirts per suit, and he bought 10 suits, so he bought a total of:
10 suits * 3 dress shirts per suit = 30 dress shirts
The dress shirts cost $60 each, so the total cost of the dress shirts is:
30 dress shirts * $60 per shirt = $1,800

Now, we can add up the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost of James' new wardrobe:
$7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts) = $11,800

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. How many cookies does he have now?","To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to track the changes in the number of cookies he has throughout the day.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

For his early day snack, he eats 3 cookies, one of each flavor. So, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he has:
- 8 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

After that, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he has:
- 8 + 4 = 12 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Finally, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he has:

40,A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"To determine how much money is used, we first need to calculate how many quarters each person will use during the 4-hour period.

Jack can play a game for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he can play 3 games per hour (60/20 = 3). In 4 hours, he can play 4 * 3 = 12 games. Since each game costs 1 quarter, Jack will use 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long. This means they can play a game for 10 minutes with 1 quarter (20/2 = 10). They can play 6 games per hour (60/10 = 6). In 4 hours, they can play 4 * 6 = 24 games. Since each game costs 1 quarter, each of these two friends will use 24 quarters. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 2 * 24 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long. This means he can play a game for 30 minutes with 1 quarter (20 * 1.5 = 30). He can play 2 games per hour (60/30 = 2). In 4 hours, he can play 4 * 2 = 8 games. Since each game costs 1 quarter, this friend will use 8 quarters.

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
Jack: 12 quarters
Two friends who are worse: 48 quarters
One friend who is better: 8 quarters
Total quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25 = $17

41,Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"To calculate the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to first determine the number of movies that are not in series and the number of movies that are in series.

Let's start by finding the number of movies that are in series. We are told that a third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Now, we know that the remaining movies are not in series. We can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies not in series = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Next, we are told that 40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5. We can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 x 400
= 160 movies

Now, we can calculate the cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies x $5
= 160 x $5
= $800

The remaining movies that are not in series are not older movies, so they cost $10 each. We can calculate the number of these movies as follows:

Number of non-older movies = Total number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

Now, we can calculate the cost of the non-older movies:

Cost of non-older movies = Number of non-older movies x $10
= 240 x $10
= $2400

Now, let's calculate the cost of the movies in series. We are told that Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together. Since a normal movie costs $10, the cost of a movie in series is:

Cost of a movie in series = $6 of $10
= 0.6 x $10
= $6

Now, we can calculate the cost of the movies in series:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series x $6
= 200 x $6
= $1200

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection:

Total cost = Cost of older movies + Cost of non-older movies + Cost of movies in series
= $800 + $2400 + $1200
= $4400

How many quilt blocks does he have in total?,"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, and he is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Gene goes on 4 vacations a year. Therefore, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations per year = 44 vacations.

Since every shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?,"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from everyone else first. This includes the money collected from the neighbors, the online fund, and Walter's friend.

The total amount collected from the neighbors is $500.
The total amount collected from the online fund is $1500.
The total amount collected from Walter's friend is $200.

So, the total amount collected from everyone else is $500 + $1500 + $200 = $2200.

How many students are leaving early?","First, we need to find out how many students are football players. 20% of the class are football players, so we multiply 30 students by 20% (or 0.20) to find out how many students are football players: 30 * 0.20 = 6 students.

Now we need to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band. We know that 6 students are football players, so we subtract 6 from the total number of students to find out how many students are not football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Out of the remaining class (24 students), 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band. We multiply 24 students by 25% (or 0.25) to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band: 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days is:
4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity:
18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

He's already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?","To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants, the cost of the crowns, and any additional costs.

The base price of 2 implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.
The cost of the crowns is 2 x $500 = $1000.
However, one of the crowns is made of porcelain, which may have an additional cost. Since the problem doesn't specify an additional cost for the porcelain crown, we'll assume it's the same price as the regular crown.

The total cost of the dental work is $4000 (implants) + $1000 (crowns) = $5000.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $5000 - $600 = $4400.

To calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($4400) by his hourly wage ($15).

$4400 / $15 per hour = 293.33 hours

Since George can't work a fraction of an hour, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?","To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we first need to calculate how much he produces in the first three weeks. 

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

In the first three weeks, Boris produces 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate. Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we can calculate how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the total bars produced in the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

So, the production in the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate.

48,"Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?","Let's break down the information we have:

1. Julia bought a new package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table.
4. Before that, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.

We can start by subtracting the 3 spoons Julia used from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table: 12 - 3 = 9 spoons.

We know that Julia's husband contributed 5 spoons to this total. To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we can subtract the 5 spoons from the total: 9 - 5 = 4 spoons.

So, the package Julia bought contained 4 spoons, but this is not the total number of spoons in the package, since she had already used 3 spoons before her husband gave her the 5 additional spoons. We need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 4 spoons that were left: 4 + 3 = 7 spoons.

However, this still may not be the total number of spoons in the package Julia bought. We do not know if Julia used all the spoons in the package or if there were some left over. Since the problem does not provide any additional information, we will assume that Julia used 3 spoons from the package and that there were 4 spoons left, so the package contained at least 7 spoons, but we do not know if there were any more than that.

However, the problem does say ""When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons."" And ""Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia."" This indicates that the 12 spoons includes the 5 spoons her husband bought, and that Julia had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons before her husband gave her the 5 additional spoons. Since Julia used 3 spoons, this means that she must have had 7 + 3 = 10 spoons before her husband gave her the 5 additional spoons, but this is not possible since 7 + 3 is 10, and we know that Julia had 7 spoons before her husband gave her the 5 additional spoons, so Julia must have had 7 - 3 = 4 spoons from the package she bought and 3 spoons that she used from the package she bought. But we know that Julia had 7 spoons before her husband gave her the 5 additional spoons, so this means that the package Julia bought must have had 7 + 3 = 10 spoons, but we know that Julia had 7 spoons before her husband gave her the 5 additional spoons, and 3 spoons that she used, so the package Julia bought must have had 7 + 3 = 10 spoons.

49,"A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under the UV light, and these jellyfish are a third of the large jellyfish in the tank.

Since 6 jellyfish represent a third of the large jellyfish, we can multiply 6 by 3 to find the total number of large jellyfish:

6 jellyfish * 3 = 18 large jellyfish

We also know that the large jellyfish are a fifth of the total number of jellyfish in the tank. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5:

18 large jellyfish * 5 = 90 total jellyfish

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

50,"Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining after 8 hours.

After 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour, and after that, it lost 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. 

Let's start with the last 3 hours. The power bank lost 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours, so it lost a total of 7% * 3 = 21% of the total capacity in those 3 hours.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours was 28%. This means that before the last 3 hours, the charge remaining was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours. The power bank lost 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours, so it lost a total of 9% * 5 = 45% of the total capacity in those 5 hours.

We know that before the first 5 hours, the charge remaining was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is 3 * 5 = 15.

Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is 4 * 6 = 24.

Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is 5 * 4 = 20.

However, she drops 1 flower of each type, so we need to subtract the petals from these dropped flowers. She drops 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, and 1 flower with 4 petals. The total number of petals to subtract is 5 + 6 + 4 = 15.

After dropping these flowers, Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. The total number of petals from these flowers is 6 * 7 = 42. However, she also drops 1 of these flowers, so we need to subtract 7 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals from all the flowers: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 - 15 - 7 = 79.

So in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff. They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table. So they need 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables. They already own 15 tables.

53,"Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to find out how many seashells they had in total before dividing them equally. 

Let's start with Carrey. We don't know how many seashells Carrey collected, so let's call it x. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
2x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:
2x = 22

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:
x = 11

So Carrey collected 11 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2 * 11 = 22 seashells. And since Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, Jim collected 22 + 5 = 27 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells:
11 (Carrey) + 22 (Carlos) + 27 (Jim) = 60 seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which is 1 check per quarter * 4 quarters per year = 4 checks per year.

He writes a check once per month to pay the electric bill, which is 1 check per month * 12 months per year = 12 checks per year.

He writes a check twice per month to the church, which is 2 checks per month * 12 months per year = 24 checks per year.

If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he received from the sale and subtract the costs he incurred.

The selling price of the house is $400,000. Mr. Tan paid a transfer fee of 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. He also paid a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

So, the total fees Mr. Tan paid are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

In addition to the fees, Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 to settle the remaining loan amount on the house.

To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total costs from the selling price:

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Loan amount
= $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
= $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds per howl. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds per howl.

To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to add up the time it takes for each wolf to howl. Since we are given the time per howl, we can assume that each wolf howls once. The combined length of time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). The combined length of time is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

58,"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit and subtract it from the $50 he has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shirt after the 30% discount. The original price of the shirt is $25. To find the discount amount, we multiply the price by the discount percentage: $25 * 0.30 = $7.50. So, the discount amount is $7.50. Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the cost of the shorts to the discounted price of the shirt to get the total cost of the outfit: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

However, Joe only has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the outfit ($52.50) is more than the amount he has ($50), Joe will not be able to afford the outfit. He will be short $2.50.

But, since the question asks for the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we will assume that Joe will not buy the outfit if he cannot afford it. In this case, he will have the same amount of money he started with, minus the amount he is short. However, since he is short, he will not make the purchase. So he will still have the $50.

However, let's do the math assuming he did make the purchase and went over budget.

If Joe were to make the purchase, he would be short $2.50. So he would have $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50. However, since he cannot go into debt in this scenario, we will assume he did not make the purchase.

So the correct answer is that he still has the $50.

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost was 20 * $20 = $400. She also got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost was 20 * $30 = $600. With the 10% discount, the discount amount is $600 * 0.10 = $60. Therefore, the final price Sheila paid was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books that one bookcase can hold.

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each, and there are 2 of them, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which is 20 - 5 = 15 books.

So, one bookcase can hold 20 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, so to find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books that one bookcase can hold:

110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.

The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings. 
The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. 
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside.

So, the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is 9 + 31 + 8 = 48.

Since Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62, we can find out the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the new total number of toys.

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 62 - 48 = 14.

How many calories is the omelet?,"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The eggs are 75 calories each, and there are 6 eggs in the omelet, so the total calories from the eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The cheese is 120 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces of cheese in the omelet, so the total calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The ham is 40 calories per ounce, and there is an equal amount of ham to cheese, which is 2 ounces. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to find the total calories in the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

After returning an item that cost $15.00, her new balance would be $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount would be 20% of $20.00, which is 0.2 * $20.00 = $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount would be 10% of $30.00, which is 0.1 * $30.00 = $3.00. So, the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

64,Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day. The plane tickets cost $5000 each. If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?,"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, we need to find 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 

20% of $1500 is 0.2 x $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price for one day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is $1800 x 3 = $5400.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets to find the total cost of the trip.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. So, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns 500 x 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 x 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns 500 x 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person for the activities she wants to do. 

The cost for a round of mini-golf is $5 per person.
The cost for arcade tokens is $5 per person.
The cost for riding the go-karts twice is $10 per ride * 2 rides = $20 per person.

So, the total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30 per person.

Since Morgan also needs to include herself in the party, the total number of people will be the number of friends she invites plus 1 (for herself).

Let's denote the number of friends Morgan can invite as 'x'. Then, the total number of people is 'x + 1'.

The total cost for the party will be $30 per person * (x + 1) people.

Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. So, we can set up the equation:

30(x + 1) = 90

Expanding the equation:

30x + 30 = 90

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

30x = 60

Dividing both sides by 30:

x = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2 and divide by 5: 5 * 2 / 5 = 2.
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
Twice 7 is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles Meredith wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about a blog article, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

70,"Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we first need to calculate the total points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 points is 0.3 x 50 = 15 points. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 x 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:

Adam: 50 points
Betty: 65 points
Tom: 35 points
Marta: 105 points

Total points collected by the class: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

400 - 255 = 145 points.

The answer is {145}."
71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as x and the number of orange fish Bob bought as y.

We know that Bob started with 7 fish in his pond, 3 orange and 4 white. After buying 17 fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

So, the total number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + y (bought) and the total number of white fish is 4 (initial) + x (bought).

Since Bob bought 17 fish, we have the equation x + y = 17.

We also know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, so we can write the equation 3 + y = 2(4 + x).

Simplifying the second equation, we get 3 + y = 8 + 2x.

Substituting y = 17 - x (from the first equation) into the second equation, we get 3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x.

Combine like terms, we get 20 - x = 8 + 2x.

Add x to both sides, we get 20 = 8 + 3x.

Subtract 8 from both sides, we get 12 = 3x.

Divide both sides by 3, we get x = 4.

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

72,"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?","To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected this year and add it to the stickers he already had.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. So, the total number of stickers he had at the end of last year was 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers he collected this year to the total number of stickers he had at the end of last year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to first determine how many toys all the workers together produce per hour, and then subtract the production of the first four workers.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour together produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
The two workers who produce 4 toys an hour together produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
So the first four workers together produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

The total number of toys needed is 400, and by the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed, so the workers produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys during their 10-hour shift.

Since the workers worked for 10 hours, the total production per hour is 380 toys / 10 hours = 38 toys per hour.

Now, we subtract the production of the first four workers from the total production per hour to find the production of the fifth worker: 38 toys per hour - 20 toys per hour = 18 toys per hour.

The answer is {18}."
74,"Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.   Stephen added a $4.00 tip. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final bill and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount he paid after adding the tip, delivery fee, and vendor fee.

First, we add the tip to the original bill: $40.00 + $4.00 = $44.00.

Next, we calculate the vendor fee, which is 25% of the total bill (including the tip): 25% of $44.00 = 0.25 x $44.00 = $11.00.

Now, we add the vendor fee and delivery fee to the total bill: $44.00 + $11.00 + $3.00 = $58.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.00.

How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?,"Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. The total number of questions on both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. To find 70% of 110 questions, we multiply 110 by 0.7. This gives us 110 * 0.7 = 77 questions that Audrey needs to answer correctly.

On the first test, Audrey gets 60% of the questions correct. To find 60% of 70 questions, we multiply 70 by 0.6. This gives us 70 * 0.6 = 42 questions that Audrey answered correctly on the first test.

Since Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total, and she answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, she needs to answer 77 - 42 = 35 questions correctly on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

76,Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then determine how many jelly beans it can hold, taking into account the packing efficiency. 

First, we calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. So, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of a single jelly bean, which is given as 0.15 cubic inches.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans that the jar can hold, taking into account the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is given as 80%. So, the effective volume of the jar for holding jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans that the jar can hold by dividing the effective volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as 0.3 * 2880 = 864.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. Therefore, the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and Tim's estimate is 900 - 864 = 36.

Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?","To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to determine the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, we can set up the equation:

Number of white carnations * 5 = 200

To find the number of white carnations, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

Number of white carnations = 200 / 5
Number of white carnations = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses she ordered. We know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, Sidney originally had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs. This left Sidney with 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs.

So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, which means he added 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs. Therefore, Sidney now has 12 (remaining) + 12 (newly added) = 24 meatballs.

After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. The friend's house is 200 miles away. How long did the trip take?,"To find the total time it took for John's trip, we need to calculate the time it took for him to drive to his friend's house and the time it took for him to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The original distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 mph, so the time it took for him to drive to his friend's house is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance from his friend's house to his home is 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 mph. So, the time it took for him to drive back home is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Finally, we add the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house and the time it took for him to drive back home to find the total time for the trip:

Total Time = Time to friend's house + Time to drive back home
Total Time = 3 hours + 3 hours

How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the total change in temperature over the 9 hours.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling during this time is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling during this time is 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming during this time is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the sum of the cooling and warming: 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Since the room cooled down by 14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus. Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?","To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to first calculate how many customers he needs to get into the dealership. Since one out of every two customers buys a car, Jason needs 15 x 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars.

Next, we need to calculate how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers into the dealership. Since one out of every 25 telephone calls results in a customer coming into the dealership, Jason needs to make 30 x 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 customers into the dealership.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","To find out how much profit Millie will make per hour, we need to first calculate the total profit she makes from selling all the lemonade, and then divide that by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, each holding 12 cups, so she has 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade to sell. She sells each cup for $1, so she will make 36 x $1 = $36 from selling all the lemonade.

However, she spent $18 to buy the supplies, so her profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups to sell, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours running the stand.

To find out her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she spends running the stand: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.

The second friend says there are 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of the first friend's guess is 80/2 = 40. So, the second friend's guess is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend says there are 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, the third friend's guess is 80 + 20 = 100.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 1/2 * 28 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 6 from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday: 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of tennis shoes.

If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV on the other days and subtract that from the total amount of time he spent watching TV.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night, so he watched 2 hours of TV on those days. 

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours of TV.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours of TV.

So, in total, Frankie watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the amount of time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

We can then divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?,"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to first calculate the total number of fireworks that will be set off by the city and Hannah.

The city will set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, which is a total of 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

Now, let's calculate how many of the city's fireworks Hannah will see. Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, she will see 40% of 300 fireworks, which is 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks she will set off herself (15) to the number of the city's fireworks she will see (120). 

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  He lost 10 bills while getting home.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?","To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 twenty-dollar bills.

After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Since he hasn't lost any bills yet, he still has 50 twenty-dollar bills. Half of 50 is 25, so he uses 25 twenty-dollar bills to pay for the bill, leaving him with 50 - 25 = 25 twenty-dollar bills.

Thomas then triples his money. This means he now has 3 times the amount of money he had before, which is 3 x 500 = 1500 dollars (since 25 twenty-dollar bills equal 25 x 20 = 500 dollars).

However, we are told that Thomas lost 10 twenty-dollar bills while getting home. So, before tripling his money, he actually had 25 - 10 = 15 twenty-dollar bills, which is equivalent to 15 x 20 = 300 dollars. Tripling this amount gives him 3 x 300 = 900 dollars.

Finally, Thomas converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money he has (900 dollars) by 5. This gives us 900 / 5 = 180 five-dollar bills.

If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?","To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater and then subtract the time it takes for Wayne to be driven to the theater, taking into account that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

We are given that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to add 5 minutes to Wayne's travel time to find the latest time Bernadette can arrive. Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, so Bernadette's latest arrival time is 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before the premiere starts.

Now, we subtract the latest arrival time from Bernadette's travel time to find out how much earlier she should leave than Wayne. Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, and her latest arrival time is 9 minutes before the premiere starts, so she should leave 16 - 9 = 7 minutes before Wayne.

96,"To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day than he planted on the first day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we can multiply 40 by 1/4 or divide 40 by 4. 40 / 4 = 10, so 1/4 of 40 is 10. Therefore, Mr. Julius planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now we can add up the total number of trees planted on each day:

Day 1: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
Day 2: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas.  On the second day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas. How many bananas did Gunther count to be in the pile?","To find out how many bananas Gunther counted, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Gunther started with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas on the first day, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. So, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
3. On the second day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. However, Arnold stole 12 bananas that evening, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther counted his bananas on the third day, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"To calculate the total cost of the driving service per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile. We also need to add the total bonus paid to the driver per year.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year:
John goes to work 5 days a week, so he makes 2 trips (to and from work) per day, which is 2 x 30 miles = 60 miles per day.
Since he goes to work 5 days a week, he drives 60 miles/day x 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
In a year, he drives 300 miles/week x 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 miles/year x $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate the total bonus paid to the driver per year:
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus per year is $150/month x 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the driving service per year:
The total cost is the sum of the driving cost and the bonus, which is $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

99,"Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies, so before dropping them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We are also told that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he originally wanted to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation:

2x = 100

where x is the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 100 / 2
x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?","To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so he ate 8 ounces of meat.
The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces).

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will be staying for a total of 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day).

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay option, he will pay 1600 pesos.

If Cameron chooses the 12-hour stay option and adds on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark, he will pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and 5 hours x 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos for the additional hours. So, the total cost will be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The difference in cost between the two options is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

102,Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we first need to calculate how much money he has. 

Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 weeks * $6 per week = $18.

He then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. So, he bought 4 cones in total. The cost of the cones is 4 cones * $1.25 per cone = $5.

Now, Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket. 

$13 / $6.50 = 2.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can only buy 2 movie tickets.

103,"Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana has 27 cups in total and she uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, and she has 3 rows, the total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea (12 cups) is divided equally between the two types of tea. Therefore, there are 12 / 2 = 6 cups for each type of tea.

Now, since there are 3 rows, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 6 / 3 = 2 cups.

Since Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

Since they shared 4 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices in 4 pizzas is 4 x 8 = 32 slices. However, the question asks for the total number of slices they ate, which we already calculated as 31 slices.

Half of 8 rooms is 8/2 = 4 rooms.

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 small candles per room, so the total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles.

For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 5 medium candles per room, so the total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles.

In total, the family is using 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person gets a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights for the people is 4 people * 1 flashlight per person = 4 flashlights.

There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room gets 2 flashlights, so the total number of flashlights for the rooms is 8 rooms * 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. How many dollars did she make that day?","To find out how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply it by the cost per tire.

First, let's calculate the number of tires from the bicycles: 5 bicycles * 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires.

Next, let's calculate the number of tires from the tricycles: 3 tricycles * 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires.

Finally, we have the unicycle with 1 tire.

The total number of tires inflated is: 10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","To determine the total amount of feed needed for the day, we first need to calculate the total daily feed required for 20 chickens. Each chicken is fed 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals per day. Therefore, the total daily feed per chicken is 3 cups/meal * 3 meals = 9 cups. For 20 chickens, the total daily feed required is 9 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 180 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. The total amount of feed given so far is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed already given from the total daily feed required: 180 cups - 40 cups = 140 cups.

Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day. 

Later that evening, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to calculate the probability that none of the scenarios where he gets an extension will occur.

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

1. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance).
2. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework (50% chance).
3. The normal teacher doesn't give everyone an extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension (20% chance).

To calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that none of these scenarios occur.

The probability that the normal teacher doesn't give everyone an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%.
The probability that the substitute teacher doesn't come in is 100% - 50% = 50%.
The probability that Marcus doesn't get a personal extension is 100% - 20% = 80%.

Since these events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together to get the probability that none of the scenarios occur:

60% (no extension from normal teacher) * 50% (no substitute teacher) * 80% (no personal extension) = 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.24

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.24 * 100 = 24%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"To find out how many buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to break down her trades step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

The rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) are traded for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Next, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 small stickers is 27 small stickers. Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has:

- Large buttons: 20 (from trading large stickers) + 9 (from trading small stickers) = 29 large buttons
- Small buttons: 60 (from trading large stickers) 

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large and small buttons together. However, the question does not specify whether the buttons should be counted in terms of their size. But to give a total count, we'll consider each button as one unit regardless of size.

So, the total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 89 buttons.

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into several categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. The total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

However, each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo, which adds an additional 20% cost per frame. The additional cost per frame is $20 x 0.20 = $4. So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + (44 x $4) = $880 + $176 = $1056.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 x 0.25 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts. The total cost is $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Mike is currently pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people. Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind, so he writes 2 letters per person per week. Since there are 3 people, he writes a total of 2 * 3 = 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes a total of 6 letters * 5 pages per letter = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?,"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate how long it will take him to finish the book and then subtract the time it takes to get to the airport and the time he has before he needs to be there.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, and Toby has to be there in 60 minutes. So, the total time he has available to read and get to the airport is 60 minutes.

The time it will take Toby to finish the book and get to the airport is 30 minutes (to finish the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, and it will take him 40 minutes to finish the book and get there, he will be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

Calculate how much he got in refunds.,"To calculate the amount of refund Mr. Marcellus received, we need to first determine the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date. Since 2/5 of the milk had expired, we can calculate the amount of expired milk as follows:

Expired milk = 2/5 * Total milk purchased
Expired milk = 2/5 * 4000 gallons
Expired milk = 1600 gallons

Since the milk was purchased at $3.5 per gallon, the total cost of the expired milk can be calculated as follows:

Cost of expired milk = Expired milk * Cost per gallon
Cost of expired milk = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
Cost of expired milk = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600.

(Round to the nearest integer.)","To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 pounds x $2.00/pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00/box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

119,"Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. On the seventh day, he wasn't traveling at all. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?","To find the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each part of the trip and then add them together.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. So, the total distance traveled in the next two days is:
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since Tom didn't travel at all on the seventh day, the total distance traveled in the first week is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we can add the distance traveled in the first week and the second week to find the total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

120,"Glue sticks come in packs of 8. Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required for all the students. 

Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

However, Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, so he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure that every student gets 2 glue sticks, with some extra glue sticks left over.

122,There are 3 classes. Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of students in the school and then the total number of girls.

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students is 3 x 20 = 60.

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the total number of girls is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 x 60 = 30.

We know the number of girls in the first two classes: 15 in the first class and 12 in the second class, for a total of 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know that the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

123,Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate \u00be of their pizzas. Each pizza had 12 slices. How many slices of pizza were left?,"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate how many slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each. So, the three of them ate a total of 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. They ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each. So, the two of them ate a total of 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

In total, the five friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Since each pizza has 12 slices and there were 5 pizzas, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

124,"James buys a plane. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. The plane cost $150,000. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?","To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the initial cost of the plane, the monthly cost of renting a hanger, and the monthly cost of fuel, and then add these costs together for the first year.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly cost of renting a hanger is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting a hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting a hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add the initial cost of the plane, the total cost of renting a hanger for the first year, and the total cost of fuel for the first year to find the total cost of the plane for the first year.

Total cost = Initial cost + Hanger cost + Fuel cost
Total cost = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000
Total cost = $330,000

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?","James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs. However, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needed to buy 8 more toys to accommodate the new dogs. 

At this point, James had 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.

However, when James came back, he found that there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means that there were 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since James already had 12 dogs, the total number of dogs now is 12 + 16 = 28 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed to buy 16 more toys to accommodate the new dogs. 

Now, James had 12 (previous toys) + 16 (new toys) = 28 toys for 28 dogs.

However, when James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so James no longer needed those toys. This means that James now needs toys for 28 - 3 = 25 dogs.

Since James already had 28 toys, he still has enough toys for the remaining dogs. Therefore, James needs a total of 28 toys initially, but he can reuse the 3 extra toys for future dogs.

128,Billy sells DVDs. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each.  His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs.  His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?,"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers.

His first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so they bought a total of 3 * 0 = 0 DVDs.

His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

However, we are told that Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday. We already know about 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 customers. But the order in which they are mentioned is first, next, and last. So the ""next"" 2 customers must be the ones before the ""last"" 3 customers. Therefore, the correct order is: first 3, next 2, last 3.

So, the total number of DVDs sold is 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

How many trees does he have left?,"Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year for 10 years, so he plants a total of 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees.

He also chops down 2 trees a year for 10 years, so he chops down a total of 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.

After 10 years, he has 50 (initial trees) + 100 (planted trees) - 20 (chopped down trees) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 130 trees is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. So, 39 trees die.

How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we first need to determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm. We know that he sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. 

So, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, we know that Mr. Smith had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y initially. After selling 10 goats from Farm X and 20 goats from Farm Y, the number of goats left in each farm is:

Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats

How much does he make?","To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make from the tree and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the tree. The tree is 80 feet long, and John can make logs out of 80% of the tree. So, the usable length of the tree is 80 x 0.8 = 64 feet.

Since each log is 4 feet long, the number of logs John can make is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is 16 logs x 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, John sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount of money he makes is 80 planks x $1.2/plank = $96.

The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"To determine the amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese and serves 4 people. Since there will be 20 people watching the game, Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people. 

To find out how many sandwiches are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of meat and cheese required is: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat, and 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is: 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is: 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we first need to figure out how many eggs were hidden and then subtract the total number of eggs found by the children.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs each child found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by the children:

5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Since there were 36 eggs hidden and the children found 27 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

36 - 27 = 9 eggs

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and then add the weight of the boxes.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the total weight:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Since each pound is 16 ounces, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

How much did everything cost?,"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he wants to buy a week's worth, which is 7 days. So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 is 0.20 x $5 = $1
So, the cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the coffee:
7 pounds x $6 per pound = $42

In addition to the coffee, Roger also bought a donut for $2. So, the total cost is:
$42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Let's break down the information provided:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, the number of students who need size small is 2 * 11 = 22.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students who need size medium is 22 - 4 = 18.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students who need size large is 18 / 2 = 9.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of students who need size extra-large is 9 + 6 = 15.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add up the number of students for each size:

How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?","To determine how many movies Colby can see, we first need to calculate how much money he has already spent this month. 

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so those cost 5 * $10 = $50. 
He saw 8 movies on other days, so those cost 8 * $7 = $56. 
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, so those cost 2 * $8 = $16. 
He had 4 boxes of candy, so those cost 4 * $2 = $8. 

In total, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130. 

Since his parents give him $150 per month, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend. 

Tonight, he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, so that will cost $8 + $2 = $10.

How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is $6.50?","To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is a total of $0.50. So, the total cost of the burrito with extras is:

$6.50 (base burrito) + $2.00 (extra meat) + $1.00 (extra cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.50 (sauces) = $11.00

Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which adds chips and a drink. So, the total cost of the meal is:

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Let's break down the information given:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as x. Then, the amount of fragrance is also x.

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x. And since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2x.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2(2x) = 4x.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces (the capacity of the jar). So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:

10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil:

Amount of oil = 4x = 4(1) = 4 ounces

The sunflowers need 4 * 3 pounds = 12 pounds of soil.
The carnations need 10 * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds of soil.

So, the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to first calculate the number of people already on the bus.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = 90.

Before the third station, the bus had 90 people. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus after the third station is 90 * 2 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?","To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her score in the second game. 

We know that in the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?","To find the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of guests and then calculate the cost based on that number.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited: 
25 classmates + 7 girls from the dance class + 13 family members = 45 people.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract them from the total:
45 people - 4 people = 41 people.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests:
41 guests - 20 guests = 21 additional guests.

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Now, we add the cost for the additional guests to the base fee:
$125 (base fee) + $126 (cost for additional guests) = $251.

Therefore, the party will cost $251.

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","To find the profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the cost price of the lumber and the selling price of the lumber after the 50% price increase.

The cost price of the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.
The cost price of the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost price of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices for lumber have gone up 50%, the selling price of the lumber will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board * 1.5 = $120.

The total selling price of the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs for her plants, we need to calculate the amount of water each group of plants requires.

First, let's consider the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. Since there are 4 plants, they need a total of 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.

Next, let's consider the rest of the plants. We know that Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 of them need half a cup of water. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 4 = 16 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so they need a total of 16 * 0.25 = 4 cups of water.

Now, let's consider the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. However, the problem doesn't mention these plants separately, so we assume that these 8 plants are already included in the 20 plants. Since the 4 plants that need half a cup of water and the 16 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water add up to 20 plants, we don't need to consider the 8 plants separately.

Finally, we add up the amount of water needed by each group of plants. The 4 plants that need half a cup of water need 2 cups, and the 16 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water need 4 cups. So, the total amount of water needed is 2 + 4 = 6 cups.

148,"Caroline has 4 children. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. The first child is 6 feet tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","To find the height of the fourth child, we need to start by finding the height of the first child in inches, then use the information given to find the heights of the other children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

149,"A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?","To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on both Thursday and Friday.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and charges $40 per tire. The total revenue earned on Friday is:
12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue earned on Thursday is:
6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned higher revenue on Thursday.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

The answer is {40}."
151,"Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we first need to determine the number of each type of bike he sold. 

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes, with half of them being Trekking bikes. This means he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. This means he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. Since Marcel sold 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes, the number of MTB bikes he sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, we know the prices of each type of bike: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB which is $250, and a Trekking bike is $450.

To calculate Marcel's total earnings, we multiply the number of each type of bike by its price and add them together.

Marcel's earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500.
Marcel's earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250.
Marcel's earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500.

Marcel's total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

153,Ali is a superstar counter. His friend Izzy is also a really good counter and has 5 less medals than Ali. Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast. Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?,"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we first need to find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's call the total number of medals given out 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as:

39 = x/10

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

154,"A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","To determine the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one apple costs $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

We also know that oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. So, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- Bananas: 5 bananas * $1 per banana = $5
- Apples: 12 apples * $0.5 per apple = $6
- Oranges: 7 oranges * $3 per orange = $21

Finally, we add the cost of each type of fruit to get the total price of the crate:

$5 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $21 (oranges) = $32

156,"As Sally entered school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  Previously, when she started walking to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. At this time, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?","To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had initially, the number of balloons that burst or were released, and the number of balloons she added from the tree.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.

A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. 40% of 25 red balloons is 0.4 * 25 = 10 balloons. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

The shockingly loud sound also caused Sally to accidentally release half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 yellow balloons is 12 / 2 = 6 balloons. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Sally then found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 balloons. So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (no change)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6 (added from the tree)

The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.

157,"There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","To calculate the total time John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time he spends in class, and the time he spends on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time he spends in class per week. There are 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. However, John has to take 2 extra classes a day, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the time he spends on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each of these days. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. He spends 1/16 of this time on Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on each of these days. Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, he spends a total of 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes per week on extra learning.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends learning per week. He spends 1600 minutes per week in class, and 1260 minutes per week on extra learning, so he spends a total of 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes per week learning.

Finally, let's convert this time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 2860 / 60 = 47.67 hours per week learning.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. How many stamps did Max buy in all?","To find out how many stamps Max bought in all, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps he bought, in addition to the 16 snowflake stamps.

We know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

We also know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we can add up the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps to find out how many stamps Max bought in all: 16 (snowflake stamps) + 19 (truck stamps) + 10 (rose stamps) = 45 stamps.

He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each added feature and then add them to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

The towing package is not given a specific price, but since the question asks for the total cost of the truck with all the added features, we will assume that the towing package is included in the total cost.

However, we are not given the price of the two-ton truck. Since the question asks for the total cost of the truck with all the added features, we will assume that the two-ton truck is the base price of the truck, which is $30,000.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the added features:

$7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $13,500

Adding this to the base price of the truck, we get:

$30,000 (base price) + $13,500 (added features) = $43,500

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet and then divide it by their speed.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes
Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Since Steve is faster, he will arrive home first. To find the waiting time, we subtract Tim's time from Steve's time:

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

163,It takes Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"To find out how much water the boat took on, we first need to determine how far Julia rowed back towards the shore. We are given that it takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can calculate her rowing speed as 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, Julia rowed for 64 seconds at a speed of 1.25 feet per second. So, the total distance she rowed is 64 seconds * 1.25 feet per second = 80 feet.

We are given that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rowed. To find out how many sets of 10 feet she rowed, we can divide the total distance by 10 feet: 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 sets.

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for each set of 10 feet, the total amount of water the boat took on is 8 sets * 2 liters per set = 16 liters.

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how many pounds of gravel Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

We know that when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. We also know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds of gravel. So, the total amount of gravel that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total amount of gravel that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total amount of gravel that the three trucks combined can haul. So, Gary's truck can carry 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds of gravel.

They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

At the end of the second day, the pirates dug 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

At the end of the third day, the pirates dug 23 + 8 = 31 holes. However, they also filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Now, we can find the number of holes dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Now, we can calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day by subtracting the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Total bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day = 45 bananas
Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day = 10 + 14 = 24 bananas

So, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

How many lines does Sean have to memorize?","To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines he has to memorize for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics, and all of them are Sean's lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. However, only four-fifths of them are his lines. Four-fifths of 60 is (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are his lines. A third of 108 is (1/3) * 108 = 36 lines.

Now, we can add up the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each scene and the song: 54 (song) + 48 (second scene) + 36 (first scene) = 138 lines.

No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 

There are 10 cages of hamsters with 1 hamster in each cage. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.

The total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

We are told that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents in total. This means that the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate how much money she has in total and subtract the amount she needs to buy the laptop.

Erika's mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. She also gets $150 from her part-time job. Additionally, trading in her old laptop reduces the price of the new one by $200. The laptop originally costs $600, but with the trade-in, the price is reduced to $600 - $200 = $400. Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, this means she already has $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has from her mom and her part-time job: $80 (from her mom) + $150 (from her part-time job) = $230. 

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she has from her mom and her part-time job from the total amount she already has: $350 (total amount she already has) - $230 (amount from her mom and part-time job) = $120.

What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. How fast does the faster car go?,"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to start by finding the speed of the second-fastest car. Since the second-fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can multiply the speed of the average car by 5.

Speed of average car = 120 miles per hour
Speed of second-fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour

Now that we know the speed of the second-fastest car, we can find the speed of the fastest car. Since the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second-fastest car, we can multiply the speed of the second-fastest car by 1.25.

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour

How much did he make?","To find out how much James made, we first need to calculate the profit made on each car. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost of each car is 30% of $25,000.

Cost of each car = 30% of $25,000
= 0.30 * $25,000
= $7,500

Profit on each car = Selling price - Cost

There will be 30 kids and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have 4 jello cups. How much will he spend on jello?,"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs. There will be 30 kids at the party, and each kid will get 4 jello cups, so the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since each 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12.

So, Greg needs to buy 12 boxes of jello. Since each box costs $1.25, the total amount he will spend on jello is 12 * $1.25 = $15.

175,There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.  Mariah's grandma was teaching Mariah to knit. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.  How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?,"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah's grandma and Mariah separately and then add them together.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah's grandma and Mariah to find the total yards used: 182 yards + 91 yards = 273 yards.

The answer is {273}."
176,"Amalia, Megan, and Dior divided the home chores so that each person had something to do while the others were working. Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore.  Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.","To find the total time it took for all three to complete their chores, we need to find the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry. This means Dior took at least 4 + 4 = 8 hours. However, since it says ""well over 4 hours longer"", we can assume she took more than 8 hours. But since we don't have an exact number, we will use the minimum time, which is 8 hours.

Now, let's add the time each person took to complete their chores: 
Amalia took 4 hours, 
Megan took 6 hours, 
Dior took 8 hours. 

So, the total time is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

177,"A shop sells school supplies. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10.  How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?","To find out how much Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:
Discount = 10% of $30 = 0.10 x $30 = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?","Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200 from her first job. 

She already has $80 in her savings. 

She also earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75 from her second job.

In total, Annabelle now has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

She is saving for a phone that costs $400. 

To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the amount she currently has from the cost of the phone: 400 - 355 = $45.

179,"Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?","To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to determine the number of apples she picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56 from selling them. Since she sells apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday as follows:

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total amount earned on Monday / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The answer is {50}."

What is the weight of Harry, in kg?","To find Harry's weight, we need to first find Christian's weight. We know that Martin's weight is 55 kg, and Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. So, Carl's weight is:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
= 55 kg + 16 kg
= 71 kg

We also know that Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. So, Christian's weight is:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
= 71 kg + 8 kg
= 79 kg

Finally, we know that Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. So, Harry's weight is:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
= 79 kg - 5 kg
= 74 kg

How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?","To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height, so its height became 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches, so its height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?","To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we first need to determine the total number of potted plants she currently has. 

Mary received 18 new potted plants yesterday. She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. So, she had 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially.

After receiving 18 new potted plants, she now has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

However, she has decided to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family tomorrow. So, she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she currently has. 

Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants.

183,"There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. Among those that are not indoor plants, two-thirds of them are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to first determine the number of indoor plants, then the number of outdoor plants, and finally the number of flowering plants.

Given that one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants, we can calculate the number of indoor plants as follows:
Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * Total number of plants
= 1/4 * 100
= 25

Since the remaining plants are not indoor plants, we can calculate the number of non-indoor plants as follows:
Number of non-indoor plants = Total number of plants - Number of indoor plants
= 100 - 25
= 75

Among the non-indoor plants, two-thirds are outdoor plants, and the rest are flowering plants. We can calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:
Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * Number of non-indoor plants
= 2/3 * 75
= 50

Now, we can calculate the number of flowering plants as follows:
Number of flowering plants = Number of non-indoor plants - Number of outdoor plants
= 75 - 50
= 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we can divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
Percentage of flowering plants = (Number of flowering plants / Total number of plants) * 100
= (25 / 100) * 100
= 25%

It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.   How much will this cost her?","To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of additional items Angela has beyond what is included in the initial installation package.

The initial package includes hanging 4 mirrors, but Angela has 6 mirrors. So, she needs to install 2 additional mirrors.

The initial package includes hanging 1 chandelier, but Angela has 2 chandeliers. So, she needs to install 1 additional chandelier.

The initial package includes hanging 10 pictures, but Angela has 20 pictures. So, she needs to install 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the initial installation package is $129.00. The cost of installing additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of installing the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation package plus the cost of installing the additional items. Therefore, the total cost is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

185,"Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  The bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?","To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of each bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

186,Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?,"To find the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages and the finale firework, and then add them together.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much as the first package, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

So, the total cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the cost of the two packages after the discount, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to first determine the capacity of each class in John's school and then add it to the capacity of Ali's class.

Since each class in John's school has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of each class in John's school as follows:

Capacity of each class in John's school = 1/8 * 120
= 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15
= 30 students

Now, we can add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools:

Combined capacity of both schools = Total capacity of John's school + Capacity of Ali's class
= 30 + 120
= 150 students

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we first need to determine the cost of the green apple gum and then subtract the costs of the grape gum and the green apple gum from the total amount Suzie paid.

We know that Suzie paid half as much for the small pack of green apple gum as she paid for the pack of grape gum. Since she paid $2 for the pack of grape gum, she paid $2/2 = $1 for the pack of green apple gum.

Now, let's subtract the costs of the grape gum and the green apple gum from the total amount Suzie paid:

$7 (total amount) - $2 (grape gum) - $1 (green apple gum) = $4

Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, we can divide the remaining amount by 2 to find the cost of each pack:

$4 / 2 = $2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, for a total of $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

He also got 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so those cards are worth 30 x $50 = $1500.

In total, the cards he got are worth $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. This means it will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves after 30 minutes, the second train will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train will stay for 20/4 = 5 minutes. This means the second train will leave the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves after 65 minutes, the third train will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave after 125 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves after 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?","To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she already has. Since she has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, we can multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks per week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Melanie currently has 120 toothpicks. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture:

200 toothpicks (required) - 120 toothpicks (already saved) = 80 toothpicks (still needed)

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks per week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks she needs to make the sculpture.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?","To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we first need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.

For the T-shirts, the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that Jake will pay the full price for one T-shirt and 50% of the price for the second T-shirt. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the cost of the T-shirts will be:

$8 (full price for the first T-shirt) + $8 * 0.5 (50% of the price for the second T-shirt) = $8 + $4 = $12

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$40 * 0.4 = $16

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:

$40 - $16 = $24

So, the cost of the shoes is $24.

199,"100 people apply for a job at Google.  Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of the people who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. Of the people who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. How many people accept the position?","To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to break down the information given step by step.

First, we are told that 30% of the people who apply receive interviews. Since 100 people apply, we can calculate the number of people who receive interviews as follows:

Number of people who receive interviews = 30% of 100
= 0.30 * 100
= 30 people

Next, we are told that 20% of the people who receive interviews receive a job offer. We can calculate the number of people who receive a job offer as follows:

Number of people who receive a job offer = 20% of 30
= 0.20 * 30
= 6 people

Finally, we are told that a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position. We can calculate the number of people who accept the position as follows:

Number of people who accept the position = 1/3 of 6
= 6 / 3
= 2 people

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

200,"Mr. Rogers sold a watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it.  The watch was originally $2000, but was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch and then compare it to the original price.

First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of its original price, the price he paid was:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price was:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

The original price of the watch was $2000, and Mr. Rogers sold it to his friend for $1800. To find the percentage discount, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price:
Percentage discount = ((Original price - Selling price) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%

So, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

201,"James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: swimming the first 60% of the distance, resting on the island, and swimming the remaining distance.

First, we need to find the distance James swam at his normal pace. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate this distance as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to swim this distance as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

After swimming for 6 hours, James rested on the island for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, we need to find the remaining distance James had to swim. Since he already swam 12 miles, the remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims at half his normal speed for the remaining distance, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

We can find the time it took James to swim the remaining distance as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to get across the lake by adding the swimming time, rest time, and the time it took him to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?","To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

The total cost of all the items she bought is $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10, so she has $10 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation that represents the cost of each venue.

Let's say the number of guests is x.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

Since we want to find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday compared to Monday. On Monday, 32 classes visited. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?","To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

We know that 32 classes visited on Monday. Since twice as many visited on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of classes that visited on Tuesday as 2 * 32 = 64.

Similarly, since three times as many visited on Wednesday compared to Monday, we can calculate the number of classes that visited on Wednesday as 3 * 32 = 96.

We are also given that 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 classes visited on Friday.

Now, we can add up the number of classes that visited each day to find the total:

Monday: 32
Tuesday: 64
Wednesday: 96
Thursday: 30
Friday: 25

Total number of classes = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We also know that in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. So, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve this equation, we'll multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set) is 6, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

209,Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours the makeup artist worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the discount.

The makeup artist worked 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 
Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean paid.
Final amount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Sam sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday, for a total of 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates during the weekdays. 

Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. 

So, the total number of crates he sold during the week is 45 + 20 = 65 crates.

Since his target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of crates he sold from his target: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective earnings after working 20 hours.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. Since Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Billy's salary after 2 months was $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour, and after his first anniversary, it increased to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their earnings after working 20 hours:

Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them, we first need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the birthday surprise.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, and the balloons were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, they must have bought 12/2 = 6 sets of balloons. So, the total cost of the balloons is 6 sets * $0.5 per set = $3.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money they spent: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since the remaining money was used to buy the ice cream, the total amount of money they had initially must have been the cost of the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream: $28.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother, we can divide the total amount of money they had by 2 to find out how much each one of them received: $28 / 2 = $14.

If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to buy the jacket and shoes, and then subtract the amount of money she already has and the amount of money she earns from babysitting.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 x $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits, for a total of $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting. So, the total amount of money she has before mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the amount of money she already has from the total cost of the jacket and shoes: $70 - $30 = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount of money she needs ($40) by the amount of money she earns per lawn-mowing job ($4) to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10.

How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?","To find the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, the town will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes they have built so far. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes. However, this is the total number of homes they will have built after the third year, not the number of homes built in the third year. To find the number of homes built in the third year, we need to subtract the total number of homes built in the first two years from the total number of homes they will have built after the third year. So, the number of homes built in the third year is 96 - 48 = 48 homes.

Now, we can add the number of homes built in each year to find the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years: 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 homes.

The bagel costs $4. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25: $4 * 0.25 = $1. Then, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. So, the soup costs $5.

What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, the cost is $4 and it yields 200 sticks. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, the cost is $6 and it yields 400 sticks. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest option.

Frederick has $24 to buy wood for sticks. To maximize the number of sticks, he should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible. He can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Each 2 x 8 piece of wood yields 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will yield 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature of the second mug of water. Let's call this temperature x.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the second mug, the total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

Since Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 oz x 33°) + (1 oz x x°) = 5 oz x 40°

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

However, this is not the correct answer. The temperature of the second mug of water cannot be 68 degrees, as it would be too hot for Donny to drink.

We need to consider that the temperature of the water in the bottle is a mixture of the temperatures of the two mugs of water. Since the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, we can set up an inequality:

(4/5)x 33° + (1/5)x x° ≥ 40°

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

132/5 + x/5 ≥ 200/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 68

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees.

Let's try to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the inequality:

x ≥ 68

Since x must be greater than or equal to 68, the minimum value of x is 68. However, this would make the temperature of the water in the bottle exactly 40 degrees. To make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees, the minimum value of x must be greater than 68.

However, we can calculate the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees.

(4/5)x 33° + (1/5)x x° = 40°

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132/5 + x/5 = 200/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

However, we want to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees. 

Since 4 ounces of 33-degree water were added to 1 ounce of x-degree water, and the resulting temperature was at least 40 degrees, we can calculate the minimum temperature of the second mug of water.

Let's assume the temperature of the water in the bottle is exactly 40 degrees.

(4/5)x 33° + (1/5)x x° = 40°

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132/5 + x/5 = 200/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

However, we want to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees.

We can calculate the minimum temperature of the second mug of water by using the equation:

(4/5)x 33° + (1/5)x x° ≥ 40°

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

132/5 + x/5 ≥ 200/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 68

However, we want to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees.

We can calculate the minimum temperature of the second mug of water by using the equation:

(4/5)x 33° + (1/5)x x° = 40°

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132/5 + x/5 = 200/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

However, we want to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would make the temperature of the water in the bottle at least 40 degrees.

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The initial price of the boat is $9000.

In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%. To calculate the depreciation, we multiply the initial price by the depreciation percentage:
$9000 * 0.30 = $2700
So, the value of the boat after the first year is:
$9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. We calculate the depreciation based on the value of the boat after the first year:
$6300 * 0.30 = $1890
So, the value of the boat after the second year is:
$6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. We calculate the depreciation based on the value of the boat after the second year:
$4410 * 0.20 = $882
So, the value of the boat after the third year is:
$4410 - $882 = $3528

227,"Each student in Marissa's class started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","To find out how many pencils were left, we first need to determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students in Marissa's class and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. 1/5 of 300 is 300 / 5 = 60 pencils. So, 60 pencils were used, leaving 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 1/3 of 240 is 240 / 3 = 80 pencils. So, 80 pencils were left.

228,"Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she spent sleeping and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

The total time she spent sleeping is 8 hours - 5 minutes = 7 hours 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get:
7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes
Adding the 55 minutes, we get:
420 + 55 = 475 minutes

However, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is a total of:
2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

Subtracting the time she spent sleepwalking from the total time she spent sleeping, we get:
475 - 23 = 452 minutes

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to find out how many square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips. So, the total number of glass chips he has is 2 * 72 = 144.

It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Therefore, the total number of square inches Milo can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to find the length that will give him a total area of 12 square inches. We can do this by dividing the total area by the height: 12 / 3 = 4.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

80,"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.

Now, we are given that Cole saved a total of $6 when he bought both the jeans on sale. We are also told that he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's assume the savings from the jogger jeans is x. Then, the savings from the tattered jeans is 6 - x.

We know that the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, so we can set up the equation:

x = (1/3) * 6
x = 2

So, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2. This means that the jogger jeans were originally $2 more than what Cole paid for them. Since Cole paid $22 for the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

However, we are asked to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We know that the jogger jeans originally cost $24 and the tattered jeans cost $28. But the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. This means we need to subtract the price of the jogger jeans from the price of the tattered jeans.

81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","To find out how much money John had leftover after paying his debt, we need to first calculate the amount of the loan he received. Since the loan is worth 40% of his house, we can calculate the loan amount as follows:

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.4 x $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We can calculate the amount he uses to pay off his debts as follows:

Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = 0.6 x $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = $60,000

To find out how much money John had leftover after paying his debt, we can subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount:

Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
Amount leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Amount leftover = $40,000

159,"Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","To calculate the average, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average, we will ignore the lowest score when calculating the average.

Let's first find the lowest score among the first five tests. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Since we are ignoring the lowest score, we will add up the remaining four scores and the score on the sixth test, and then divide by 5 (the number of tests we are considering).

The sum of the remaining four scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as x. The sum of all the scores (excluding the lowest score) is 367 + x.

To get an average of 93, we need to set up the equation:

(367 + x) / 5 = 93

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

367 + x = 465

Subtracting 367 from both sides gives us:

x = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to calculate the total number of bandages they used and ordered over the three days, and then subtract that from the number of bandages they had left at the end of the third day.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages compared to the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages).

The total number of bandages they ordered is 50 + 100 = 150 bandages.

The total number of bandages they used is 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.

The total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is 78 bandages.

Let's say they started with x bandages on the first day. Then, the equation would be:

x + 150 (ordered) - 91 (used) = 78 (left)

x + 150 - 91 = 78

x + 59 = 78

x = 78 - 59

x = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to start by determining how many medium-sized beans he can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

We are also told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to multiply the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by 3. 

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans * 3 small beans per medium-sized bean = 450 small beans.

How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree and compare it to the total revenue generated by the tree.

The tree will cost $90 to plant, and it will cost $3 per year to water and feed the tree. So, the total cost after x years will be $90 + $3x.

The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the total revenue after x years will be 7 * $1.5 * x = $10.5x.

We want to find the number of years it will take for the total revenue to exceed the total cost. This can be represented by the inequality:

$10.5x > $90 + $3x

Subtracting $3x from both sides gives:

$7.5x > $90

Dividing both sides by $7.5 gives:

x > 12

So, it will take more than 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

However, we are interested in the smallest whole number of years, so we need to check the 12th year. After 12 years, the total cost will be $90 + $3 * 12 = $126, and the total revenue will be $10.5 * 12 = $126. Since the revenue equals the cost after 12 years, Carlos will start earning money in the 13th year.
