1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the total number of games he received or bought during this time.

In the first year, Steve received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, so he got 5 + 5 = 10 games as gifts. Since he didn't have a part-time job yet, he only saved up enough money to buy 1 game per month, which is 12 games in a year. So, in the first year, Steve had 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve again received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, so he got 5 + 5 = 10 games as gifts. He also started buying 2 games a month, which is 24 games in a year. So, in the second year, Steve had 22 (from the previous year) + 10 (gifts) + 24 (bought) = 56 games.

In the third year, Steve again received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, so he got 5 + 5 = 10 games as gifts. He also started buying 4 games a month, which is 48 games in a year. So, in the third year, Steve had 56 (from the previous year) + 10 (gifts) + 48 (bought) = 114 games.

Therefore, Steve has a total of 114 games after 3 years.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","To find the total time it takes Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes.

The total time it takes Billy to prep the potatoes is the sum of the time it takes to peel and cut them: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"James bought 10 CDs, but he didn't like 5 of them, so he sold them. The 5 CDs he sold were originally bought at a discounted price. The original price of each CD was $15, but he got them for 40% off. 

To find the discounted price of each CD, we calculate the discount amount: 40% of $15 is 0.4 * $15 = $6. The discounted price is then $15 - $6 = $9 per CD.

Since James bought 10 CDs at the discounted price of $9 each, he spent a total of 10 * $9 = $90.

He sold the 5 CDs he didn't like for $40. 

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the amount he spent on all the CDs: $90 - $40 = $50.

The answer is {50}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to determine the total number of seats and then calculate the number of seats occupied by students.

The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats, with 18 seats in each row. Therefore, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72 seats.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is (1/4) * 72 = 18 seats.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, which is (1/3) * 54 = 18 seats.

The rest of the seats were occupied by students, which is 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many glass chips he has in total and then calculate how many square inches he can cover with those chips.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of glass chips he has is:
2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can calculate the total number of square inches he can cover with the chips he has:
144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can calculate the length of the mosaic by dividing the total number of square inches by the height:
12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to find the total miles all the dogs need to walk and then subtract the miles we already know.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

We know that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. Since there are 4 dogs, the total miles they need to walk per day is 3 miles * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

Now, we add the miles we know: 
1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles

We subtract this total from the total miles all the dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total miles) - 8 miles (miles we know) = 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each scent sold.

The company sells 5 of each of the vanilla scents, and they already have 4 vanilla scents available. So, the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sells 2 of each of the fruity scents, and they already have 8 fruity scents available. So, the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

To find the difference in sales between the vanilla and fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will have to pay $450 to repair the damage to his car. If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to pay for 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each, which is 3 * $25 = $75. Additionally, he will be fined $120 by the city council for unauthorized road maintenance, so the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $75 + $120 = $195. By fixing the pothole, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom first. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The padding underneath the carpet costs $2 per square foot, so the cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the removal cost, installation cost, carpet cost, and padding cost: $864 + $7344 + $2592 + $432 = $11232.

10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to first calculate how many apples she and her sister gathered from the tallest and shortest trees.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half of this amount, which is 30/2 = 15 apples, from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees by both sisters is:
30 (Joanne's from the tallest trees) + 60 (her sister's from the tallest trees) + 15 (Joanne's from the shortest trees) + 45 (her sister's from the shortest trees) = 150 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is:
500 (total apples) - 150 (apples from the tallest and shortest trees) = 350 apples.

Since Joanne's sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, all 350 apples from the average trees were gathered by Joanne.

The answer is {350}."
11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","To find out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate how many flowers she needs to buy. 

First, we need to calculate the total space taken up by each flower, including the space between flowers. Since each flower grows 12 inches wide, we need to convert this to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot. 

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, the total space taken up by each flower is 1 foot (for the flower itself) + 1.5 feet (for the space between flowers) = 2.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate how many flowers Pat can fit in her 111-foot flower bed. We'll subtract the space taken up by the 17 flowers Pat already owns, since we don't need to buy those. 

The space taken up by the 17 flowers Pat already owns is 17 flowers * 2.5 feet per flower = 42.5 feet.

So, the remaining space in the flower bed is 111 feet - 42.5 feet = 68.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate how many flowers Pat can fit in the remaining space. We'll divide the remaining space by the space taken up by each flower.

68.5 feet / 2.5 feet per flower = 27.4 flowers.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 27 flowers.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 27 flowers to fill up the remaining space in her flower bed.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 27 flowers * $6 per flower = $162.

12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total amount of time he spent on all activities.

We know that John spent 6 hours boating, and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

We are told that these activities account for 30% of John's total time. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:

15 hours = 0.3 * Total time

To solve for Total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing. We are told that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as follows:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * Total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

13,"Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. These are his only expenses. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?","To calculate the profit that Kim will make each week, we first need to calculate his total expenses. He already has 3 clients and is expecting to get 5 more, so he will have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. The total cost for each client will be 2 * $2 (for the bleach) + $5 (for the cloths) = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, his total expenses will be 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week will be $92. To calculate his profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
= $92 - $72
= $20

The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them, because on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. How many people sang in the performance?","To find out how many people sang in the performance, we first need to find out how many female members are in the choir. Since there are 52 members in total and 50% of them are girls, the number of female members is 52 * 0.5 = 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show, so the number of female members who can perform is 26 * 0.5 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount of chalk he uses each day.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk he used, we need to calculate 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 x 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we subtract the amount used from the original length.

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Now, we know that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how much chalk that is, we need to calculate 20% of the original length (since we are looking for the number of days the chalk will last, not the number of days it will last from the current length).

20% of 5 inches = 0.20 x 5 = 1 inch

However, since we are interested in the number of days the remaining chalk will last, we should calculate 20% of the remaining chalk length.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 x 2.75 = 0.55 inches

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk length by the amount used each day to find out how many days the chalk will last.

2.75 inches / 0.55 inches per day = 5 days

However, since the chalk is recycled when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the chalk to reach that length.

Let's calculate how much chalk is left after each day:

Day 1: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches
Day 2: 2.20 - 0.55 = 1.65 inches
Day 3: 1.65 - 0.55 = 1.10 inches

On the fourth day, the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches (1.10 - 0.55 = 0.55 inches). Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the fourth day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before the teacher has to recycle the chalk. Since the teacher will recycle the chalk on the fourth day, that means he has 3 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

16,"Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?","To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

The volume of the pool is 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

However, the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. So, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:

8260 gallons * $0.10 per gallon = $826.00

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","To determine who the winner is and how much farther they ran, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Kelly initially ran back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she is running to the 40-yard line and back, that is a total of 2 * 40 yards = 80 yards per trip. So she ran 80 yards * 34 trips = 2720 yards. Adding this to her initial 200 yards, Kelly ran a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times, which is 15 * 2 * 100 yards = 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we need to subtract Kelly's total from Blake's total: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

18,Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.  The bag has 36 cookies and she puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.  How many cookies does Jenny eat?,"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies eaten by her husband and son.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so her son eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

The total number of cookies eaten by Jenny's husband and son is 7 + 20 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"To find the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area of the north and south walls is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area of the east and west walls is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed to paint the room is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of painting the room is the number of gallons needed multiplied by the cost per gallon, which is 12 * $12 = $144.

In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","To find the total number of guests the hotel has after dinner, we need to consider the initial number of guests, the number of guests who checked out, the number of guests who checked in after dinner, and the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon.

The hotel was initially completely booked with 100 guests. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests elected for a late checkout, which means they are still at the hotel. This does not change the total number of guests.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the total number of guests becomes 76 + 7 = 83.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon is 2 * 15 = 30.

The total number of guests after dinner is 83 (initial guests remaining + guests who checked in after dinner) + 30 (guests who checked in during the afternoon) = 113.

However, we need to subtract the 15 guests who opted for a late checkout, because they were already included in the initial count of 100 guests. So, the correct total number of guests after dinner is 113 - 15 + 15 (to include the late checkout guests) = 113.

Total days: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Now, let's divide the total calorie deficit required by the number of days Andy has to achieve his goal:
105,000 calories / 200 days = approximately 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 525 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.

23,"Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?","To calculate the total amount Artie will make, we need to first round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar. 

- Marigolds are usually sold for $2.74 per pot, which rounds to $3 per pot.
- Petunias are usually sold for $1.87 per pot, which rounds to $2 per pot.
- Begonias are usually sold for $2.12 per pot, which rounds to $2 per pot.

Now we can calculate the total amount Artie will make:

- 12 pots of marigolds at $3 per pot is 12 * $3 = $36.
- 9 pots of petunias at $2 per pot is 9 * $2 = $18.
- 17 pots of begonias at $2 per pot is 17 * $2 = $34.

The total amount Artie will make is $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

24,"The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag. Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?","To find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice, we need to first figure out how many balls each of the boys carried. 

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. We also know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

We are also given that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now that we know how many balls each of the boys carried, we can find the total number of balls by adding the number of balls each boy carried. 

Total number of balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total number of balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total number of balls = 7

The answer is {7}."

On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?","To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that number by 7 (the number of days).

We know that on days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds each, so that's a total of 240 birds. On day six, he saw 20 birds, and on day seven, he saw 90 birds. On day three, he saw no birds.

The total number of birds Mack saw over the week is:
50 (days 1-2) + 240 (days 4-5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) + 0 (day 3) = 400

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we divide the total number of birds by 7:
400 / 7 = 57.14 (round to 2 decimal places)

Since we're looking for the average number of birds per day, we can round this number to the nearest whole number:

He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?","To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to first calculate how many problems he completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, Chris completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Chris on Monday and Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

This means that the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Chris on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

This means that the number of problems remaining after Wednesday is 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

28,"Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first calculate the total amount he earned per branch. Since he made $105 in a week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his daily earnings as follows:

$105 / 7 days = $15 per day

Since Felix charges $.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed in a week as follows:

$105 / $.25 per branch = 420 branches

Now, we can calculate the number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","To find the total number of kernels that popped, we need to break down the popping process into four stages: the first 30 seconds, the next 30 seconds, the final 30 seconds, and the residual heat popping.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped at three times the rate of the first 30 seconds. So, 20 * 3 = 60 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate. Since the initial rate was 20 kernels in 30 seconds, the rate in the final 30 seconds is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. However, the problem states that the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds in the final 30 seconds. Since the past 30 seconds had 60 kernels popping, half of that rate is 60 / 2 = 30 kernels per 30 seconds. But we know that the rate increased to 80 kernels per 30 seconds before slowing down, so the actual number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 80 - (80 - 30) = 30 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Since 30 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that is 30 / 4 = 7.5 kernels. However, since we can't have a fraction of a kernel, we'll round down to 7 kernels.

Now, we add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 30 + 7 = 117 kernels.

30,"An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we first need to find the cost of each item. We are given that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

We are also given that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?","To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time it went off: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?,"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to break down his gum usage throughout the day.

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum.

During the 8-hour school day, he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, so he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum, and after dinner, he chews 1 more piece of gum. So, in total, he chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Before bed, he gives half of his remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces of gum he has left before giving some to his sister, we subtract the gum he has already chewed from his initial amount: 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum.

Since he gives half of his remaining gum to his sister, he gives 14/2 = 7 pieces of gum to his sister.

Now, we subtract the gum he gave to his sister from his remaining amount: 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and then divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck:

4500 / 2250 = 2

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

Next to Affenpinscher sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?","To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to first determine the weight of the Papillon. We know that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds. So, the Dachshund weighs 2 x 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 x 5 = 220 pounds.

How many slices of cheese did he use?,"Carl ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches.

He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost that day, we first need to calculate the total amount he lost. 

On the first race, he lost $5. 
On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 in the second race.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11 in the second race, so 1.5 times that amount is $11 x 1.5 = $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 in the third race.

The total amount he lost is the sum of the amounts he lost in the first and third races, minus the amount he won in the second race (since winning is the opposite of losing). This is $5 + $16.50 - $11 = $10.50.

To find the average amount he lost that day, we divide the total amount he lost by the number of races, which is 3. The average amount he lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

How much did everything cost?,"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts separately and then add them together.

The cost of the suits is 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7500.
The cost of the dress pants is 10 dress pants * (1/5 * $750) per dress pant = 10 * $150 = $1500.
The cost of the dress shirts is 10 suits * 3 dress shirts per suit * $60 per dress shirt = 10 * 3 * $60 = $1800.

Now, we add the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts together to find the total cost: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by Jack and his friends.

Jack can play a game for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is equal to 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, which means they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long, which means he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two worse friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the number of movies into different categories and calculate the cost for each category.

First, we know that a third of the movies are in series, which means the number of movies in series is 600 / 3 = 200 movies. Since Mike can buy these movies at a discount by purchasing the series together, the cost for these movies will be 2/3 of the normal cost, which is $10 * 2/3 = $6.67 per movie (but we will use $6 for the calculation as per the problem statement). So, the total cost for the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies. Out of these, 40% are older movies that cost $5 each. To find the number of older movies, we calculate 40% of 400, which is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies. The cost for these older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies, which are normal movies costing $10 each. The cost for these movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Now, we add up the costs for all the categories to find the total cost: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

How many students are leaving early?","To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members in Mr. Roper's class.

First, we calculate the number of football players. 20% of the class are football players, so we multiply the total number of students by 0.20.

Number of football players = 30 students * 0.20 = 6 students

Now, we need to find out how many students are left after subtracting the football players.

Remaining students = 30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band. We multiply the remaining number of students by 0.25.

Number of cheerleaders and band members = 24 students * 0.25 = 6 students

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

Total students leaving early = 6 students (football players) + 6 students (cheerleaders and band members) = 12 students

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, they pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, they pumped a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons over the two days.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?","To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost for the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500 for each implant. However, for one of the implants, George wants a crown made of porcelain, which we assume has the same price as the regular crown, $500. So, the total cost for the crowns is 2 * $500 = $1000.

The total cost of the dental work is the cost of the implants plus the cost of the crowns, which is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $5000 - $600 = $4400.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage: $4400 / $15 per hour = 293.33 hours.

The answer is {293.33}."
47,"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?","To find out how much Boris produces the fourth week, we need to determine how much he produces in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

The third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

48,"Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?","To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

At the time of setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This total includes the spoons from the package her husband bought (5 spoons) and the spoons from the package she bought herself.

Before setting the table, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. This means that before using those 3 spoons, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.

Since her husband's package contributed 5 spoons to this total, the package Julia bought must have contained 15 - 5 = 10 spoons.

49,"A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color from green to blue under UV light, and that these jellyfish represent one-third of the large jellyfish in the tank.

Let's start by finding the total number of large jellyfish. Since 6 jellyfish represent one-third of the large jellyfish, we can multiply 6 by 3 to find the total number of large jellyfish:

6 jellyfish x 3 = 18 large jellyfish

Now, we know that the large jellyfish represent one-fifth of the total number of jellyfish in the tank. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5:

18 large jellyfish x 5 = 90 jellyfish

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

50,"Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

First, let's calculate the charge remaining after 3 hours of losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining was 28% after this period, we can set up an equation:

Charge after 3 hours = Charge before 3 hours - (7% * 3 hours)
28% = Charge before 3 hours - 21%
Charge before 3 hours = 28% + 21% = 49%

Now, let's calculate the charge remaining after 5 hours of losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining was 49% after this period, we can set up an equation:

Charge after 5 hours = Charge before 5 hours - (9% * 5 hours)
49% = Charge before 5 hours - 45%
Charge before 5 hours = 49% + 45% = 94%

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

51,"Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower, subtract the petals from the dropped flowers, and then add them all together.

Rose first picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which gives us 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, giving us 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each, resulting in 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

As she's carrying these flowers, she drops 1 of each type. The dropped flowers have a total of 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of petals from the flowers she didn't drop: 15 petals from the first type of flowers, 24 petals from the second type, and 20 petals from the third type, minus the 15 petals from the dropped flowers. However, since she only dropped one of each, we need to subtract 1 flower from each type, not the total petals of the dropped flowers. 

So, the correct calculation is: 
(3-1) * 5 + (4-1) * 6 + (5-1) * 4 = 2 * 5 + 3 * 6 + 4 * 4 = 10 + 18 + 16 = 44 petals.

Then, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, giving us 6 * 7 = 42 petals. She also drops 1 of these flowers, which has 7 petals.

Finally, we add the total number of petals from all the flowers she didn't drop: 44 petals from the first three types of flowers and 42 - 7 = 35 petals from the last type of flowers.

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 44 + 35 = 79 petals.

Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first figure out how many seashells they had in total, and then divide that number by 3.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

In total, they had 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

When they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?","To find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the information given in the problem.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive. 
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
So, at this point, 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left the hive initially have not returned yet.

It is given that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. This means that the 15 bees that left the hive initially and hadn't returned yet will return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 15.

Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?","Buford writes a check every month for the gas bill, so he writes 1 check per month for the gas bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year for the gas bill.

Buford also writes a check to pay the electric bill once per month, so he writes 1 check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year for the electric bill.

Buford writes a check to the church twice per month, so he writes 2 checks per month for the church. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year for the church.

Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes a check every 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 / 3 = 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add the number of checks he writes for each of these expenses. So the total number of checks is 12 (gas bill) + 12 (electric bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount of fees he paid and subtract that from the selling price, then also subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount of fees Mr. Tan paid is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds:

And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl. Since we are not given the number of howls, we will assume that the time given is the total time Tobias howls.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the time each wolf howls to find the combined length of time: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

58,"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt has a price of $25, and there is a 30% off sale. To find the discount amount, we can multiply the price by the discount percentage:

Discount = $25 x 30% = $25 x 0.30 = $7.50

Now, we can subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the shirt:

Sale price of shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we can add the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:

Total cost = Sale price of shirt + Price of shorts
= $17.50 + $35
= $52.50

Since Joe has $50 to spend, he doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit. However, if we assume that he can make the purchase, we can calculate how much money he will have left:

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
= $50 - $52.50
= -$2.50

Since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Joe will be short $2.50. However, if we assume that he can make the purchase, we can say that he will have $0 left and be $2.50 in debt.

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost was 20 * $20 = $400. However, she had a voucher for $2 off, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price of the pomegranates increased to $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost was 20 * $30 = $600. With the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. Therefore, the final price Sheila paid was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold. 

We are given that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Therefore, one bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, and each bookcase can hold 55 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books that one bookcase can hold: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls = 9 + 31 + 8 = 48

After buying the bouncy balls, Sophie now has a total of 62 toys.

To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys now:

How many calories is the omelet?,"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. There are 6 eggs in the omelet, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. There are 2 oz of cheese in the omelet, and each oz of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Finally, let's calculate the calories from the ham. There are 2 oz of ham in the omelet (since the amount of ham is equal to the amount of cheese), and each oz of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, let's add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to find the total calories in the omelet: 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

What is the new balance on her credit card?","Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. 

She then returned an item that cost $15.00, so her new balance would be $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. So the sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. So the sale price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?,"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to first find the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. However, since it is a busy weekend, the price is 20% more expensive. To find the new price, we can calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the original price.

20% of $1500 is 0.20 x $1500 = $300.

So, the new price of the hotel is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is $1800 x 3 = $5400.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people (Tom and his wife), the total cost of the plane tickets is $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets.

Total cost = $5400 (hotel) + $10,000 (plane tickets) = $15,400.

How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?","Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week for two different publishers, Publisher A and Publisher B. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns 500 sentences * 5 cents per sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 cents * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns 500 sentences * 10 cents per sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

How many friends can she invite?","To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person for the activities she wants to do. 

The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5 per person. 
The cost for $5 in arcade tokens is $5 per person. 
The cost for two go-kart rides is 2 * $10 = $20 per person.

So, the total cost per person is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30 per person.

Morgan also needs to include herself in the party, so we need to calculate the total number of people, including Morgan. 

Let's assume the number of friends Morgan can invite is x. Then, the total number of people, including Morgan, is x + 1.

The total cost for the party is the total cost per person multiplied by the total number of people: $30 * (x + 1).

Morgan's budget for the party is $90. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

$30 * (x + 1) = $90

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by $30:

x + 1 = $90 / $30
x + 1 = 3
x = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. In addition to the team members and their guests, there are 3 coaches. Therefore, the total number of people attending the game is 12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy: 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza to find out how much Maddy will spend: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
To calculate this, we multiply 5 by 2/5 and then add the result to 5.
2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7
So, Meredith wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
To calculate this, we multiply 7 by 2.
7 * 2 = 14
So, Meredith wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, we can calculate the total number of articles Meredith wrote in the three days.
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can multiply the total number of articles by 4 to find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles.
26 * 4 = 104 hours

70,"Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty has 30% more points than Adam. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of Adam's points and add it to his points.
30% of 50 points is 0.3 * 50 = 15 points.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points collected by the students.
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105
Total points = 255 points

Since the minimum threshold is 400 points, the class is missing:
400 - 255 = 145 points

The answer is {145}."
71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","To find out how many white fish Bob bought at the store, we need to first determine the total number of white fish and orange fish in Bob's pond after he added the new fish.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the 17 new fish, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's assume the number of white fish is x. Then, the number of orange fish is 2x.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond is the sum of the initial fish and the new fish: 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24 fish.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 24 - 7 (since we subtract the initial 7 fish to find the number of new fish).

Combine like terms: 3x = 17

Divide by 3: x = 17/3 is not a whole number, but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we can try to find the closest whole number. However, we need to find the number of white fish, and since we know the total number of new fish is 17, we can try to find a combination that works.

Let's go back to the fact that Bob had 4 white fish initially and 3 orange fish initially. If he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can try to find a combination that works.

Assume the number of white fish Bob bought is x. Then, the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, the total number of orange fish is 2(4 + x).

We know that the total number of new fish is 17, so the number of orange fish Bob bought is 17 - x.

The total number of orange fish is the sum of the initial orange fish and the new orange fish: 3 + (17 - x).

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

Expand and simplify: 3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms: 20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3x

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3x

Divide by 3: x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?","To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to determine how many stickers he collected this year and add that to the total number of stickers he had in his collection last year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so the total number of stickers he had in his collection last year was 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 2 x 50 = 100 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we add the number of stickers he collected this year to the total number of stickers he had in his collection last year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to determine how many toys were produced in total by the 5 workers during their 10-hour shift.

The manufacturer received an order for 400 toys and still needs 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the workers produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys during their 10-hour shift.

We know that 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce 12 * 10 = 120 toys.

We also know that another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 380 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys during the 10-hour shift.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (180) by the number of hours worked (10):

180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

74,"Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.   Stephen added a $4.00 tip. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final bill and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total cost after adding the tip, the 25% fee, and the delivery fees.

First, we add the $4.00 tip to the original bill of $40.00, making the total $40.00 + $4.00 = $44.00.

Next, we calculate the 25% fee on the new total of $44.00. To do this, we multiply $44.00 by 0.25, which gives us $44.00 * 0.25 = $11.00.

Now, we add the 25% fee to the total: $44.00 + $11.00 = $55.00.

Finally, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the total: $55.00 + $3.00 = $58.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.00.

How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?,"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly.

The total number of questions on both tests is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions.

Since Audrey must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade, she needs to answer 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions correctly.

On the first test, Audrey gets 60% of the questions correct, which is 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

77 (total correct) - 42 (correct on first test) = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

76,Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to find the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. So, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume of the jar, which is 0.8 * 540 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know that each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. So, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans in the jar is 0.3 * 2880 = 864.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. So, Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36.

To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?","To find out how many red roses Sandra ordered, we need to first find out how many white carnations she ordered. We know that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

So, we can divide the number of pink calla lilies by 5 to find the number of white carnations: 
200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.

We also know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 
So, we can multiply the number of white carnations by 4 to find the number of red roses:

78,Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.  One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. To find the number of sandwiches ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 
10 - 3 = 7
So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Since one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sandwiches is:
7 * 4 = 28

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sandwich has 4 meatballs, Mark ate:
4 * 4 = 16
meatballs.

This leaves Sidney with:
28 - 16 = 12
meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 of the sandwiches, Sidney was left with:
7 - 4 = 3
sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. This adds:
3 * 4 = 12
more meatballs.

So, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
12 (initially left) + 12 (newly ordered) = 24

79,John drives to his friend's house. He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. The friend's house is 200 miles away. How long did the trip take?,"To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time it took to drive to the friend's house and the time it took to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the distance to the friend's house. The original distance was 200 miles, but the detour added 10 miles, so the total distance to the friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

Since John drove at a speed of 70 mph, the time it took to drive to the friend's house is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time it took to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and John drove at a speed of 80 mph:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

The total time of the trip is the sum of the time it took to drive to the friend's house and the time it took to drive back home:

Total Time = 3 hours + 3 hours

80,"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","To find the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original prices of both jeans.

Let's start by finding the original price of the jogger jeans. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Now, let's calculate the total original price of both jeans. The total original price is the sum of the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans. The total original price is $28 + $22 = $50.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(Total original price - Total sale price) = Total savings
($50 - Total sale price) = $6

To find the total sale price, we can rearrange the equation:

Total sale price = Total original price - Total savings
Total sale price = $50 - $6
Total sale price = $44

We know that Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's calculate the amount saved from each type of jeans.

Amount saved from jogger jeans = (1/3) * Total savings
Amount saved from jogger jeans = (1/3) * $6
Amount saved from jogger jeans = $2

Amount saved from tattered jeans = Total savings - Amount saved from jogger jeans
Amount saved from tattered jeans = $6 - $2
Amount saved from tattered jeans = $4

Now, let's find the sale price of each type of jeans.

Sale price of jogger jeans = Original price - Amount saved
Sale price of jogger jeans = $22 - $2
Sale price of jogger jeans = $20

Sale price of tattered jeans = Original price - Amount saved
Sale price of tattered jeans = $28 - $4
Sale price of tattered jeans = $24

The problem asks for the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. However, it seems there might be some confusion in the problem statement, as it asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, but the jogger jeans actually cost less.

The original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $28 - $22 = $6. However, since the jogger jeans cost less, we can say that the tattered jeans originally cost $6 more than the jogger jeans.

81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","To find out how much money John had leftover after paying debt, we need to calculate the amount of the loan and the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, we need to find out the amount of the loan, which is 40% of the value of his house. 
40% of $250,000 is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.

Then, we need to find out how much he used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.
60% of $100,000 is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Now, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he had leftover.
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the total change in temperature.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming up is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature. The total cooling is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees. The total warming up is 4 degrees. So, the net change in temperature is 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus. Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?","To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. This means that Jason needs 2 customers for every 1 car sale. Since he needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 x 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls Jason makes, he gets one person to come into the dealership. This means that to get 30 customers, he needs to make 30 x 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","To find Millie's profit per hour, we first need to find out how much profit she makes from selling all the lemonade, and then divide that by the number of hours it takes her to sell it.

Millie buys enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so she makes 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36 from selling all the lemonade.

She spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, it takes her 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

Therefore, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

How many lemons will Tim need?","To make 4 gallons of regular lemonade, Tim will need 4 cups of lemon juice, since each gallon requires 1 cup of juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, Allen wants it to have twice the amount of lemon juice as the regular gallons. Since a regular gallon requires 1 cup of juice, the extra gallon will require 2 cups of juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the extra gallon will require 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

In total, Tim will need 24 lemons for the regular lemonade and 12 lemons for the extra gallon, so he will need 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. Half of 80 is 80/2 = 40. 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. 25% of 80 is 80 * 0.25 = 20. 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now we can add all three guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Finally, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average guess: 240 / 3 = 80.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 6 from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

The total number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of tennis shoes.

How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?,"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city and Hannah, and then determine how many of the city's fireworks Hannah can see.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Hannah will also set off fireworks in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display:
Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, which is 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

In addition to the city's fireworks, Hannah will also see the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
15 fireworks

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:
120 (city's fireworks) + 15 (Hannah's fireworks) = 135

92,"Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of wool required for each grandchild and then multiply it by 3 since there are 3 grandchildren.

For each grandchild, Martha wants to make:
- A hat: 2 skeins of wool
- A scarf: 4 skeins of wool
- A sweater: 12 skeins of wool
- Mittens: 1 skein of wool
- Socks: 2 skeins of wool

Total amount of wool required for each grandchild = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins of wool

Since there are 3 grandchildren, the total amount of wool required = 21 * 3 = 63 skeins of wool

The answer is {63}."
93,"Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. Each student earns the same amount.  How much did each student raise?","To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (organizations) = $125,000 (students)

Since there are 20 students, and each student earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 (students) / 20 (students) = $6,250 per student

94,"Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  He lost 10 bills while getting home.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?","To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20.

$1000 / $20 = 50 bills

However, he lost 10 bills while getting home. So, he is left with:

50 bills - 10 bills = 40 bills

Since each bill is $20, he has:

40 bills * $20 = $800

After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

40 bills / 2 = 20 bills

He uses 20 bills, which is equivalent to:

20 bills * $20 = $400

So, he is left with:

$800 - $400 = $400

He then triples his money, so he now has:

$400 * 3 = $1200

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5.

$1200 / $5 = 240 bills

Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?","To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater and then subtract the time it takes for Wayne to arrive, considering that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between Bernadette's arrival and Wayne's arrival. Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we add 5 minutes to Wayne's arrival time. So, the total time difference is 16 (Bernadette's drive time) - 4 (Wayne's drive time) = 12 minutes. However, we need to subtract the 5 minutes that Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne, so the time difference is 12 - 5 = 7 minutes is incorrect and the correct answer is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes then subtract 5 minutes to get the answer.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we need to determine the number of trees he planted each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he planted 20 x 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the first day, Mr. Julius planted a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day than he did on the first day. To calculate this, we need to find 1/4 of the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the first day, which is 40 x 1/4 = 10. Then, we add this to the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the first day, which is 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the second day, Mr. Julius planted a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the number of trees he planted on the first day to the number of trees he planted on the second day, which is 60 + 80 = 140.

On the second day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas. How many bananas did Gunther count to be in the pile?","To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas in the pile after each event.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.

On the first day, Arnold stole half of the bananas from the pile. Half of 48 is 24, so Arnold stole 24 bananas, leaving Gunther with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

On the second day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, making the total number of bananas 24 + 25 = 49. However, later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile, making the total number of bananas 37 + 6 = 43. It is on this day that Gunther began counting bananas.

Therefore, Gunther counted 43 bananas in the pile.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply that by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus paid per year.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day. Since John's work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles.

Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

Since John works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost per year for miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we first need to figure out how many cookies he originally intended to bake this year.

We know that Henry dropped 5 cookies, and after that, he had 110 cookies left. So, before he dropped the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

However, Henry also mentioned that he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. This means that the 115 cookies he had before dropping some were 15 more than his intended amount. So, his intended amount was 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

We are also told that Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. This means that the 100 cookies he intended to bake this year are twice the number of cookies he baked last year.

Let's call the number of cookies Henry baked last year 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation: 2x = 100.

Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. The total duration of his stay is 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning). If he chooses the 12-hour stay option, he will have to pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and then 70 pesos for each additional hour. Since he stayed for 17 hours, he will have to pay for 5 additional hours. The total cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay option with additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

On the other hand, if Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay option, he will have to pay 1600 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour stay option with additional hours, we need to subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay option from the cost of the 24-hour stay option. Therefore, the amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

102,Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we first need to calculate how much money he has in total. Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 3 weeks * $6 per week = $18.

Then, he spent money on ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends. The total number of ice cream cones is 1 (for Ryan) + 3 (for his friends) = 4 cones. The cost of the ice cream cones is 4 cones * $1.25 per cone = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings to find out how much money he has left: $18 - $5 = $13.

Finally, we divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of a movie ticket to find out how many tickets Ryan can buy: $13 / $6.50 per ticket = 2 tickets.

After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. We know that Lana has 27 cups in total and uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea (12 cups) is divided into two equal parts: 12 / 2 = 6 cups for each type of tea.

We also know that Lana divides the cups into 3 rows. So, to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we divide the total number of mint tea cups (6 cups) by the number of rows (3 rows): 6 / 3 = 2 cups.

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices, so the total number of slices in 4 pizzas is 4 * 8 = 32 slices.

Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. So, the total number of slices they ate is 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

However, we already know that there are 32 slices in 4 pizzas. Since Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, they must have eaten all the slices in the 4 pizzas, which is 32 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 32.

They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?","To find out how many candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's find out how many candles they have. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms will have small candles, and the other half will have medium candles. Half of 8 rooms is 8/2 = 4 rooms.

For the 4 rooms with small candles, they have 4 small candles each. So, the total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles.

For the other 4 rooms with medium candles, they have 5 medium candles each. So, the total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's find out how many flashlights they have. There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people. So, the total number of flashlights for the people is 4 people * 1 flashlight per person = 4 flashlights.

Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is 8 rooms * 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights.

Now, let's add up the total number of candles and flashlights. The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles. The total number of flashlights is 4 flashlights for the people + 16 flashlights for the rooms = 20 flashlights.

Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using is 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56.

How many dollars did she make that day?","To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

5 people came by to get both tires inflated on their bicycles, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires.
3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires.
1 person came by on a unicycle, so that's 1 unicycle tire.

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","To determine the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed each chicken receives per day. We are given that each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals per day. 

So, the total amount of feed each chicken receives per day is 3 cups/meal * 3 meals = 9 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 9 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 180 cups.

We are also given that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. 

So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

To find the number of cups of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed per day.

Therefore, the number of cups of feed needed for the final meal is 180 cups - 40 cups = 140 cups.

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities.

Scenario 1: Normal teacher and no extension
- Probability of normal teacher: 50% (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher)
- Probability of no extension: 60% (since there's a 40% chance of an extension)
- Probability of no personal extension: 80% (since there's a 20% chance of a personal extension)
- Combined probability: 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%

Scenario 2: Substitute teacher
- Probability of substitute teacher: 50%
- Since the substitute teacher won't collect homework, the probability of not having to turn in homework is 100% in this case.

Now, let's find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow. This is the probability of the normal teacher and no extension (Scenario 1), since the substitute teacher won't collect homework.

Probability of having to turn in homework: 24% (from Scenario 1)

However, we need to consider the entire sample space, which includes both the normal teacher and the substitute teacher scenarios. The probability of having to turn in homework is 24% out of the 50% chance of having a normal teacher, which is half of the total sample space. To find the overall probability, we can multiply the probability of having to turn in homework by 2 (since it's half of the total sample space), but then we need to consider the other half of the sample space where the substitute teacher won't collect homework, so we just leave the 24% as is.

But to get the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the whole sample space. The probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 50% (substitute teacher) + 50% * 40% (normal teacher with extension) + 50% * 60% * 20% (normal teacher with personal extension) = 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. 

So the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"To find out how many buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to calculate the number of buttons she gets from trading her stickers.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

She trades 50% of her large stickers, which is 40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers. She trades these for large buttons, so she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers, which is 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers, for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

She trades 90% of her small stickers, which is 30 * 0.9 = 27 small stickers. She trades these for large buttons. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She now has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

However, we are asked for the total number of buttons, and it is not specified whether we should count large and small buttons separately or combine them into a single number. But since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can express the large buttons in terms of small buttons. 

Since Lorraine has 29 large buttons and each large button is worth 3 small buttons, she has 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons' worth of large buttons. 

Adding this to the 60 small buttons she got from trading her large stickers, she has a total of 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons' worth of buttons.

However, if we want to express the answer in terms of the number of buttons, we should note that we have 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since we cannot add these two numbers directly, we can either leave the answer as 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons, or we can express the large buttons in terms of small buttons and add them to the small buttons.

But if we are asked to give a single number, we can assume that we should express the answer in terms of small buttons, so the answer would be 147.

However, another interpretation is that we should count the large buttons and small buttons separately, and then add them together. In this case, the answer would be 29 + 60 = 89 buttons.

We will use the second interpretation.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the total cost of the frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the etching. The etching adds 20% to the cost of each frame, so the total cost of the etching is 20% of $880, which is 0.20 * $880 = $176. The total cost of the frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 44 * 1/4 = 11 seniors will receive cords. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the cost of the frames with etching, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

114,Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. He was a pen pal with 5 people.  He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate how many pages he writes in a week and then convert that to hours.

Mike is a pen pal with 5 people initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of his pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, Mike receives 2 * 5 = 10 pages from each pen pal per week. Since he has 3 pen pals, he receives a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pages per week.

Mike responds in kind, which means he also writes 2 letters a week to each of his 3 pen pals, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, he writes a total of 2 * 5 * 3 = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 6 minutes per page. To find out how many minutes he spends writing in a week, we multiply the number of pages he writes by the time it takes him to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

115,Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?,"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we first need to calculate how long it will take him to finish reading the book. 

The book is 45 pages long, with an average of 200 words per page. So the total number of words in the book is 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to finish the book, we can divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, so we need to add the time it takes him to finish the book to the time it takes to get to the airport: 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we can subtract the time it will take him to get to the airport from the total time he has: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

116,Mr. Marcellus realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. A company had sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.,"To calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received, we need to first determine the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. We are given that 2/5 of the milk had gone bad.

Since Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, we can calculate the amount of milk that had gone bad as follows:

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons

This means that 1600 gallons of milk had passed the expiry date and could not be sold.

Since the cost of each gallon of milk was $3.5, we can calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received as follows:

Refund = Amount of milk gone bad * Cost per gallon
= 1600 * $3.5
= $5600

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)","To find the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but Antoine likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 pounds x $2.00/pound = $8.00.

In addition to the onions, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are also on sale for $2.00 a box. So, the total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00/box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 ÷ 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?","To determine the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and the total revenue from selling the jars.

The cost of the ingredients for 1 jar is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost of the ingredients for 1 jar is: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, the profit per jar is: $50 - $44 = $6

To make 10 jars, the total cost of the ingredients is: $44 * 10 = $440
The total revenue from selling 10 jars is: $50 * 10 = $500

The total profit from selling 10 jars is: $500 - $440 = $60

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?","To find the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distance traveled in each part of the trip.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
800 km * 0.3 = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to calculate the daily distance for these days.

On the seventh day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled on this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip by adding up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

120,"Glue sticks come in packs of 8. Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 2 * 27 = 54.

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs are required. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Dividing 54 by 8 gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure that every student gets 2 glue sticks, with some extra glue sticks left over.

122,There are 3 classes. Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

We are told that the school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of boys and girls is equal, so there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 15 - 12 = 3 girls in the third class.

Since the third class has 20 students and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate a total of 2 * 3/4 = 1.5 pizzas.

In total, the five friends ate 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 pizzas.

Since each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices eaten is 3.5 * 12 = 42 slices.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?","To find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the monthly costs and add them up for a year, then add the initial cost of the plane.

The monthly cost of renting a hanger is $5000. James also spends twice as much on fuel, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost of maintaining the plane is $5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of maintaining the plane for the first year is $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane, $150,000, to the maintenance cost for the first year, we get:

$150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (maintenance cost for the first year) = $330,000.

When 8 more dogs arrived, he needed 8 more toys to meet the total of 12 dogs. 

So, he bought 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 12 dogs when he left, there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs now. This means there were 24 - 12 = 12 new dogs, so James needed 12 more toys.

So, he bought 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those 3 toys. This means he had 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

However, the question asks for the total number of toys James needed, not the number of toys he has left. Since James needed 24 toys at one point, the total number of toys he needed is 24.

How much does he make?","To find out how much John can make from the tree, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the total length of the logs by 4 to find out how many logs John can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese and serves 4 people. Since there are 20 people watching the game, Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people. 

To find out how many sandwiches are needed, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of meat and cheese required is: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Nik wants to separate his crayons into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. So, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. The total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

How much did everything cost?,"To find the total cost of everything Roger bought, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he wants to buy a week's worth, he needs to buy 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the coffee: 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Let's break down the information provided to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.

We know that 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, the number of students who need size small is 2 * 11 = 22.

We also know that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students who need size medium is 22 - 4 = 18.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, which means the number of students who need size large is 18 / 2 = 9.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so the number of students who need size extra-large is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, let's add up the number of students who need each size:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18

He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?","To determine how many movies Colby can see, we first need to calculate how much money he has already spent this month.

He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies.
He saw 8 movies on other days, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn.
He had 4 boxes of candy, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.

In total, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130 this month.

Since his parents give him $150 to spend each month, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Now, he wants to see movies on a Friday, which costs $10 per ticket. He also wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost him $8 + $2 = $10.

So, he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left to spend on movie tickets.

Since each ticket costs $10, he can only afford to see 1 more movie.

How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is $6.50?","To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is a total of $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 

He also decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which will add chips and a drink.

The total cost of his meal is $6.50 (base burrito) + $4.50 (extra toppings) + $3.00 (upgrade) = $14.00.

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Let's break down the information we have:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as x. Then, the amount of fragrance is also x.

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x. And since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2x.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2(2x) = 4x.

We know that the total amount of scrub is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:

10x = 10

Divide by 10:

x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil:

140,"Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?","To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate how much soil they will use for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers, so they will need 3 * 4 = 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers.

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations, so they will need 1.5 * 10 = 15 pounds of soil for the carnations.

In total, they will use 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations.

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so they will have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left over for the roses.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound per rose = 3 roses.

141,"A bus has a capacity of 200 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Before its first stop, it had 20 people. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people already on the bus and subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people on the bus 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the new total number of people on the bus is 2 * 90 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

142,"Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?","To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to determine her score in the second game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can find the total points Sasha scored during both games by adding her scores from each game: 14 points (first game) + 4 points (second game) = 18 points.

144,"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?","To find the total cost of the party, we first need to determine the number of guests attending. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests and the base fee covers 20 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 guests (41 - 20 = 21). The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost: $125 + $126 = $251.

145,"Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the selling price of the lumber and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and Sasha has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 x $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and Sasha has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 x $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices of lumber have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price will be $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. Since Sasha has 10 of them, the total selling price is 10 x $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price will be $16 x 1.5 = $24 each. Since Sasha has 5 of them, the total selling price is 5 x $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit made by Sasha is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we need to calculate the total amount of water required for each type of plant.

First, let's consider the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. Since half a cup is 0.5 cups, these 4 plants will need a total of 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.

Next, we need to calculate the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water. We know that 8 plants need 1 cup of water, and 4 plants need half a cup of water. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 8 - 4 = 8 plants. Since a quarter of a cup is 0.25 cups, these 8 plants will need a total of 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the amount of water required for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. Since there are 8 plants, and each plant needs 1 cup of water, the total amount of water required is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we can add up the total amount of water required for all the plants. This is 2 cups (for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water) + 2 cups (for the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water) + 8 cups (for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water) = 12 cups.

And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. We need to convert this to inches, since the height differences are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so:

Second child's height = 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

Third child's height = 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so:

Fourth child's height = 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?","To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned on both days.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and charged $40 for each tire. The total revenue earned on Friday is:
12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and charged $60 for each tire, and also repaired 4 car tires and charged $40 for each tire. The total revenue earned on Thursday is:
6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Since the total revenue on Thursday ($520) is higher than the total revenue on Friday ($480), Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the total revenue on Friday from the total revenue on Thursday:
$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we first need to determine the number of each type of bike sold.

We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we calculate:
15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45

The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- BMX bikes: Since the price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, the price of a BMX bike is $500 / 2 = $250. So, the total earnings from BMX bikes are: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:

We also need to add the extra $10 his mother gave him later.

Dean bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so the total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
He also bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total amount of money Dean spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?,"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we first need to determine how many medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We are told that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 x 39 = 390.

One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","To find the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of a banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple. So, the cost of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we know that oranges cost three times as much as a banana per piece. So, the cost of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6

At this time, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?","To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into school, we need to consider each color separately and account for the balloons caught in the tree.

First, let's calculate the number of blue balloons Sally added to her clutch. There were 8 blue balloons caught in the tree, and she added 75% of them. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons. 

Now, let's calculate the number of red balloons Sally had after 40% of them burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons that burst. 
So, Sally had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons Sally had after she accidentally released half of them. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons that she released. 
So, Sally had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into school. 
She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 
So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into school is 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.

157,"There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","To determine the total hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the time he spends in class, as well as the extra learning time on the weekends.

First, let's calculate the time John spends in class each week. A normal student has 6 periods in a day, but John has to take 2 extra classes a day, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends a total of 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

Next, let's calculate the extra learning time on the weekends. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day, and 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of this time, which is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes, on each weekend day. Since he does this for both Saturday and Sunday, he spends a total of 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes per week on extra learning.

Now, we can add the time John spends in class and the extra learning time to get the total time he spends learning each week. 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. 2860 / 60 = 47.67 hours per week.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. How many stamps did Max buy in all?","To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck stamps and rose stamps he bought.

We know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Since he bought 16 snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps he bought is:
16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19 truck stamps

We also know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps he bought is:
19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps:
16 (snowflake stamps) + 19 (truck stamps) + 10 (rose stamps) = 45 stamps

159,"Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we first need to calculate the total score she needs for the five tests that will be included in the average. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average, we will exclude the lowest score from the total.

The lowest score Brinley has so far is 71. We will exclude this score from the total. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86.

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, and there will be five tests included in the average (after removing the lowest score), we can calculate the total score she needs as follows:

Total score needed = Desired average x Number of tests included in the average
Total score needed = 93 x 5
Total score needed = 465

Now, let's calculate the total score Brinley has so far, excluding the lowest score:

Total score so far = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86
Total score so far = 367

Since Brinley needs a total score of 465, and she already has a total score of 367, we can calculate the score she needs on the sixth test as follows:

Score needed on the sixth test = Total score needed - Total score so far
Score needed on the sixth test = 465 - 367
Score needed on the sixth test = 98

However, this calculation assumes that the score of 71 will be the lowest score. If Brinley scores lower than 71 on the sixth test, the score of 71 will no longer be the lowest score, and the calculation will be different.

To ensure that the score of 71 is the lowest score, Brinley needs to score at least 71 or higher on the sixth test. If she scores exactly 71, the total score will be:

Total score = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 71
Total score = 438

In this case, the average will be:

Average = Total score / Number of tests
Average = 438 / 5
Average = 87.6

This is lower than the desired average of 93. Therefore, Brinley needs to score higher than 71 on the sixth test.

Let's recalculate the score needed on the sixth test, assuming that the score of 71 will be the lowest score, and Brinley will score higher than 71 on the sixth test.

In this case, the total score so far is:

Total score so far = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86
Total score so far = 367

The total score needed is:

Total score needed = 465

The score needed on the sixth test is:

Score needed on the sixth test = Total score needed - Total score so far
Score needed on the sixth test = 465 - 367
Score needed on the sixth test = 98

However, this calculation assumes that the score of 71 will be replaced by the score on the sixth test. To ensure that the score of 71 is the lowest score, Brinley needs to score at least 71 or higher on the sixth test.

Since the score needed on the sixth test is 98, and Brinley needs to score at least 71 or higher, the minimum score she needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93 is 98.

160,"A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages compared to the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. However, they only used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day:

- They had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.
- On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so they were left with 12 - 28 = -16 bandages. However, this is not possible, so they must have had more bandages initially. We will come back to this later.
- On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they were left with 100 - 25 = 75 bandages.

However, we know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, not 75. This means that they must have had 78 - 75 = 3 more bandages initially.

Now, let's go back to the second day. We know that they used 28 bandages on the second day, and they were left with some bandages. Since they had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day, and they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 12 + x bandages initially, where x is the number of bandages they started with.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and they had 75 bandages left after using 25 bandages on the third day. This means that they had 75 + 3 = 78 bandages left at the end of the second day.

Since they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 78 + 28 = 106 bandages at the beginning of the second day.

We also know that they had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day, and they used 38 bandages on the first day. So, they must have had 12 + 38 = 50 bandages at the beginning of the first day, plus some extra bandages.

Since they had 106 bandages at the beginning of the second day, and they had 50 bandages at the beginning of the first day, plus some extra bandages, the extra bandages must be 106 - 50 = 56 bandages.

However, we know that they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages on the first day, so the extra bandages must be 56 - 50 = 6 bandages.

Therefore, they started with 50 + 6 = 56 bandages on the first day.

The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck and the cost of the added features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The towing package is not mentioned in the cost breakdown, so we will assume that the cost of the two-ton truck is included in the base price.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, we can add the cost of the added features to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can calculate the distances as follows:

Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes
Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting at his house before Tim finishes the race, we can subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Since it takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the distance she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds:

20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since Julia needs to row for 64 seconds to reach the shore, we can multiply the distance she rows per second by the time she rows:

1.25 feet per second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now that we know the distance Julia needs to row, we can find the amount of water the boat takes on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. To find the amount of water the boat takes on for 80 feet, we can divide 80 feet by 10 feet and multiply by 2 liters:

80 feet / 10 feet = 8
8 * 2 liters = 16 liters

Therefore, the boat takes on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reaches the shore.

164,"Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. When Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how many pounds Gordy's truck can carry. We know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. We also know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total pounds that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total pounds that the three trucks can carry.

Total pounds that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Total pounds that the three trucks can carry = 11,600 pounds

Gary's truck can carry = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

165,"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we first need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they also filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The problem states that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

166,"Mr. Robles' first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats per day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week, we can divide 315 by 7 to find out how many bananas are eaten per day:

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and the second monkey eats 14 bananas per day. We can subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats:

45 bananas per day - 10 bananas per day (first monkey) - 14 bananas per day (second monkey) = 45 - 10 - 14 = 21 bananas per day

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

167,"Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, but only a third of them are his lines. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?","To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song.

First, let's look at the solo song. The song has 54 lines in the lyrics, and all of these lines are Sean's.

Next, let's consider the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the song, which means it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. However, only four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. To find the number of lines that are Sean's, we multiply the total number of lines by 4/5. So, Sean has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines in the second scene.

Finally, let's look at the first scene. The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, which means it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's. To find the number of lines that are Sean's, we multiply the total number of lines by 1/3. So, Sean has 108 * (1/3) = 36 lines in the first scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the number of lines from the solo song, the second scene, and the first scene. This gives us 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to calculate the total amount of straw distributed among the rats and then divide that by the number of pieces each rat receives.

First, we know that the hamsters receive a total of 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per cage = 50 pieces of straw.

The rabbits receive a total of 20 pieces of straw.

We are given that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Therefore, the amount of straw distributed among the rats is 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the total amount of straw distributed among the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

We are told that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. Therefore, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3: 15 / 3 = 5 rats per cage.

How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to understand the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has from all sources except her purse. 

The laptop originally costs $600, but she gets a $200 discount for trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

She also gets $80 from her mom and $150 from her part-time job, so the total amount of money she has from these sources is $80 + $150 = $230.

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has from all sources must be $400 - $50 = $350.

We already know that she has $230 from her mom and part-time job, so the amount of money she has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

How much did he make?","To calculate James' commission, we first need to find the profit made by the company on each car. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:

$25,000 * 0.30 = $7,500

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the cost:

$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is:

$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is:

$175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500

Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. So, Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. This means that Dior took 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours to do the laundry.

Now, we can add up the time each person took to complete their task to get the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.

In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?","To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much money she currently has and subtract that from the cost of the phone.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200 from her first job.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75 from her second job.

In total, Annabelle earns $200 + $75 = $275 from her two jobs.

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, so adding the money she earned from her jobs, she now has $275 + $80 = $355.

The phone Annabelle wants costs $400, so to find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she currently has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked and got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, we can find the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she got ($56) by the price per apple ($4):

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

We are given that one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Since there are 100 plants in total, the number of indoor plants is:

100 * (1/4) = 25

Now, we know that among the plants that are not indoor plants, two-thirds of them are outdoor plants. The number of plants that are not indoor plants is:

100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants:

75 * (2/3) = 50

The rest of the plants that are not indoor plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.   How much will this cost her?","To determine the cost of the installation, we first need to calculate the number of additional items that Angela needs to have installed beyond what is included in the initial package.

The package includes installation of 4 mirrors, but Angela has 6 mirrors, so she needs to have 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors installed.

The package includes installation of 1 chandelier, but Angela has 2 chandeliers, so she needs to have 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier installed.

The package includes installation of 10 pictures, but Angela has 20 pictures, so she needs to have 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures installed.

There is no mention of shelves in Angela's items, so we can ignore that part of the package.

The total number of additional items that Angela needs to have installed is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the initial package is $129.00, and the cost of installing additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the total cost of the installation will be:

The area of each bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we can calculate the total area of the house by adding the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is $400 * 2 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: $1200 * 0.20 = $240. The discounted price of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

In addition to the two packages, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount he spent, we add the cost of the two packages and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's classes and then add it to the capacity of Ali's class.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of one of John's classes = 1/8 * Capacity of Ali's class
= 1/8 * 120
= 15 students

Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of his classes is:

Combined capacity of John's classes = 2 * Capacity of one of John's classes
= 2 * 15
= 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class to the combined capacity of John's classes:

We know that Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum. She also paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.

So, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Suzie paid $7 in total for all four packs of gum. To find out how much she paid for the two packs of strawberry gum, we subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total amount:

189,"Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  In total, he bought 3 packs for $1800 each. How much money profit did he make?","To find the total profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he got.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards is the sum of the values of the individual cards. Mark got 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each. The total value of the 30 cards is 30 * $50 = $1500. Adding the values of the two more expensive cards, the total value of all the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit Mark made is the difference between the total value of the cards and the total cost of the packs. So, the profit is $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

190,"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards. So, she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice this number is 2 * 100 = 200.

5. Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has. Initially, she had 20 cards. In the first month, she collected 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 40 cards. In the third month, she collected 200 cards. So, the total number of cards is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time it takes for the first three trains to arrive and leave the station.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, it will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train was scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, the second train will arrive in 60 - 10 = 50 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station after 50 + 5 = 55 minutes.

The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 55 + 60 = 115 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives, it will leave the station after 115 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 115 + 20 = 135 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since Paul needs to get on the fourth train, he will wait for 135 minutes.

192,A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars.

We know that the rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink also has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?","To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first need to find out how many signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. So, the total number of signatures they currently have is 20 + 44 = 64.

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal. So, 100 - 64 = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, on both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.

On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the 5 days:

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  How many pets does Larry have?,"To find out how many pets Larry has, we need to determine the number of each type of pet he has.

First, we know that Larry has 3 cats.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The number of fish is three times the number of rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

The number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, we can add up the number of each type of pet to find the total number of pets Larry has: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?","Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, she has saved a total of 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

She needs 200 toothpicks to make the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required: 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?","To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake will pay full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is 50% off, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16.
The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

At school, he passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.

Now, he has 8 lollipops (remaining from the original 24) and buys 28 more, giving him a total of 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

In the morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Of the people who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. How many people accept the position?","To find out how many people accept the position, we need to calculate the number of people who receive interviews, the number of people who receive a job offer, and the number of people who accept the position.

First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the people who apply receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of people who apply = 100
Number of people who receive interviews = 100 * 0.3 = 30

Next, let's calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of the people who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of people who receive interviews = 30
Number of people who receive a job offer = 30 * 0.2 = 6

Finally, let's calculate the number of people who accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of people who receive a job offer = 6
Number of people who accept the position = 6 / 3 = 2

What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it.

The original price of the watch was $2000. However, Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. To calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch, we multiply the original price by 0.75.

Price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. To calculate the selling price, we multiply the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch by 1.20.

Selling price = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide it by the original price.

Percentage discount = ((Original price - Selling price) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%

Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

201,"James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to calculate the time spent swimming the first part of the distance, the time spent resting, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance.

First, we need to find the distance James swam at his normal pace. Since he swam 60% of the total distance, we can calculate this as follows:

Distance swum at normal pace = 60% of 20 miles
= 0.6 x 20 miles
= 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can calculate the time spent swimming the first part of the distance as follows:

Time spent swimming at normal pace = Distance swum at normal pace / Speed
= 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
= 6 hours

After swimming for 6 hours, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

Time spent resting = 6 hours / 2
= 3 hours

Now, we need to find the remaining distance James needs to swim. Since he swam 12 miles at his normal pace, the remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum at normal pace
= 20 miles - 12 miles
= 8 miles

Since James swims at half his normal speed for the remaining distance, his speed is:

Speed for remaining distance = 2 miles per hour / 2
= 1 mile per hour

We can calculate the time spent swimming the remaining distance as follows:

Time spent swimming at half speed = Remaining distance / Speed for remaining distance
= 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
= 8 hours

Finally, we can calculate the total time it took James to cross the lake by adding the time spent swimming at his normal pace, the time spent resting, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance:

Total time = Time spent swimming at normal pace + Time spent resting + Time spent swimming at half speed
= 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
= 17 hours

How much money does Sally have left?","To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since it's ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" the cost of the second pound is half of $3, which is $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we add the cost of the 4 magnets, which is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Sally's parents gave her: $10 - $7 = $3.

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Let's denote the number of guests as x.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for x guests, which is $5x. So, the total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

To find the net number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

In 1 hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck driver picks up 3 bales, so the net number of bales left in the field is 5 - 3 = 2 bales per hour.

Since they put in a 6 hour day, the total number of bales left in the field is 2 bales per hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited compared to Monday, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited compared to Monday, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the first set as x, the second set as y, and the third set as z.

We know that in the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so we can write an equation: x = y + 4.

We also know that in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so we can write another equation: z = y/2.

We are given that the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: x + y + z = 19.

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get: (y + 4) + y + y/2 = 19.

Combine like terms: 2.5y + 4 = 19.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5y = 15.

Divide both sides by 2.5: y = 6.

Now that we know y, we can find x: x = y + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"To find out how much Jean paid, we first need to calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked. The makeup artist worked 4 times a week, for 5 weeks, and each time took 6 hours. So, the total number of hours worked is 4 * 5 * 6 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?","To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the total number of students who get to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) and each grade has 10 students who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students who get to try the escape room is 4 x 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we can form 40 / 8 = 5 groups of 8 students.

Each group uses their full 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

The answer is {225}."
214," When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour. Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  After 2 months, Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their respective hourly wages and then their total earnings.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10 per hour. Therefore, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour after 2 months, so his new hourly wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary at work, he was given another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work. Billy's total earnings will be $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230. Sally's total earnings will be $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

The difference in their total earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

215,"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree, and then compare it to the total revenue generated by the tree.

The tree will cost $90 to plant, and it will cost $3 per year to water and feed the tree. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, generating a revenue of $1.5 * 7 = $10.5 per year.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1: Cost = $90 (planting) + $3 (maintenance) = $93, Revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Cost = $3 (maintenance), Revenue = $10.5
Year 3: Cost = $3 (maintenance), Revenue = $10.5
...

We can see that the cost of planting the tree ($90) is a one-time expense, and the maintenance cost ($3) is a recurring expense. The revenue generated by the tree ($10.5) is also a recurring income.

To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point, which is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let's calculate the cumulative revenue and cost for each year:

Year 1: Cumulative Revenue = $10.5, Cumulative Cost = $93
Year 2: Cumulative Revenue = $10.5 + $10.5 = $21, Cumulative Cost = $93 + $3 = $96
Year 3: Cumulative Revenue = $21 + $10.5 = $31.5, Cumulative Cost = $96 + $3 = $99
Year 4: Cumulative Revenue = $31.5 + $10.5 = $42, Cumulative Cost = $99 + $3 = $102
Year 5: Cumulative Revenue = $42 + $10.5 = $52.5, Cumulative Cost = $102 + $3 = $105
Year 6: Cumulative Revenue = $52.5 + $10.5 = $63, Cumulative Cost = $105 + $3 = $108
Year 7: Cumulative Revenue = $63 + $10.5 = $73.5, Cumulative Cost = $108 + $3 = $111
Year 8: Cumulative Revenue = $73.5 + $10.5 = $84, Cumulative Cost = $111 + $3 = $114
Year 9: Cumulative Revenue = $84 + $10.5 = $94.5, Cumulative Cost = $114 + $3 = $117
Year 10: Cumulative Revenue = $94.5 + $10.5 = $105, Cumulative Cost = $117 + $3 = $120
Year 11: Cumulative Revenue = $105 + $10.5 = $115.5, Cumulative Cost = $120 + $3 = $123
Year 12: Cumulative Revenue = $115.5 + $10.5 = $126, Cumulative Cost = $123 + $3 = $126

We can see that the cumulative revenue exceeds the cumulative cost in Year 12. Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

216,Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then work backwards.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, and the balloons were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, they bought 12/2 = 6 sets of balloons. The cost of the balloons is 6 sets * $0.5 per set = $3.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount they spent is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since they were given the same amount of allowance by their mother, they each contributed half of the total amount spent. So, each one of them was given $28 / 2 = $14.

217,"Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to buy the jacket and shoes, and then subtract the amount of money she already has and the amount she will earn from babysitting.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 x $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, and she will earn $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting. So, the total amount of money she will have before mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost: $70 - $30 = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per mowing to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10.

218,"A local town is expanding and wants to build several new homes across the next three years. In the first year, they will build 12 homes. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?","To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built so far and double the amount. So, they will double the sum of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Doubling this amount gives 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the problem. The problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount of homes they have built. This means they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years and then build that many homes in the third year.

The correct interpretation is that they will build 96 homes in the third year, in addition to the 48 homes they already built in the first two years.

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

219,"Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?","To find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

First, we know the price of the bagel, which is $4. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we need to find the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of the price of the bagel, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which gives us $1. So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: the bagel ($4), the cake ($2), and the soup ($5). The total cost is $4 + $2 + $5 = $11.

If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?","To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet of fabric from each type of t-shirt and add them together.

For the small t-shirts, Octavia is using 11 shirts, each with 3 square feet of fabric. So, the total square feet of fabric from the small shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

For the medium t-shirts, Octavia is using 8 shirts, each with 4 square feet of fabric. So, the total square feet of fabric from the medium shirts is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

For the large t-shirts, Octavia is using 6 shirts, each with 6 square feet of fabric. So, the total square feet of fabric from the large shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the total square feet of fabric from each type of t-shirt to find the total square feet of the quilt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to determine how many laps each of them can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we can compare the number of laps Bethany can run to the number of laps Quinn can run. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To find the cheapest lumber, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For the 2 x 4, the cost is $4 and we can get 200 sticks. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For the 2 x 8, the cost is $6 and we can get 400 sticks. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 has a lower cost per stick, it is the cheapest lumber.

Frederick has $24 to buy wood for sticks. We can calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy with this amount:

$24 / $6 per 2 x 8 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood can make 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood * 400 sticks per piece = 1600 sticks

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. This means there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so now there are 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. There are 2 shaken sodas and a total of 2 + 6 = 8 sodas left.

The probability is 2/8 = 0.25, which is equivalent to 25%.

Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spits their seeds. 

Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance she spits her seeds is 40 seeds * 10 feet per seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance she spits her seeds is 35 seeds * 12 feet per seed = 420 feet.

The average total distance spat is the sum of the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney, divided by 2. 

Average total distance spat = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","To find the temperature of the second bottle, we can start by analyzing the situation. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other bottle. After mixing the water, the temperature is at least 40 degrees, which is the minimum temperature Donny can drink.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When Donny mixes the water, the total amount of water in the bottle is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

The heat energy from the two sources of water is mixed together. Since the temperature is directly proportional to the heat energy, we can set up a weighted average equation based on the amount of water from each source.

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = (5 ounces * 40 degrees)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

However, this is the temperature of the second bottle, but the question asks for the minimum temperature. Since the mixed water is at least 40 degrees, the second bottle must be at least as hot as the mixed water. But we know that the mixed water is a combination of 33-degree water and the unknown temperature water. Therefore, the unknown temperature water must be at least as hot as the mixed water.

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 - (4/1)*(40 - 33) = 68 - 28 = 40 degrees is not correct. We need to consider the ratio of the water. The correct calculation is:

(4/5) * 33 + (1/5) * x = 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(4/5) * 33 + (1/5) * x = 40
26.4 + (1/5) * x = 40
(1/5) * x = 40 - 26.4
(1/5) * x = 13.6
x = 68

x = 5 * 13.6 + 33 * (1)

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The initial price of the boat is $9000.

In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%. 
The depreciation amount is 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. 
The depreciation amount is 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. 
The depreciation amount is 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","To find the number of pencils left, we need to first determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since each student started with 10 pencils and there are 30 students in the class, the total number of pencils is 10 * 30 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply the total number of pencils by 1/5: 300 * 1/5 = 60 pencils. So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the number of remaining pencils by 1/3: 240 * 1/3 = 80 pencils.

She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","To find the total number of minutes Kim slept in her bed, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the extra 5 minutes she was awake from her usual total sleep time.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We need to convert this to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

However, on this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her total sleep time. We also need to subtract the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking (from 2:15 to 2:38 am).

The time she was sleepwalking is 23 minutes. The extra time she was awake is 5 minutes. So, the total time she was not sleeping in her bed is 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

Now, we subtract this from her usual total sleep time: 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.
