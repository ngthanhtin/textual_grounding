0,"Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","The opening bid is $200.  Three other people bid once each, and each bid increases the price by $50.  Therefore, the price after the three other bids will be $200 + (3 * $50) = $200 + $150 = $350.  Carmen then bids to win, and her winning bid will be $350 + $50 = $400.

1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Answer: First year: Steve starts with 5 games + 5 Christmas games + 12 games (1 per month) = 22 games.
Second year: Steve starts with 22 games + 5 Christmas games + 24 games (2 per month) = 51 games.
Third year: Steve starts with 51 games + 5 Christmas games + 48 games (4 per month) = 104 games.

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has a total of 104 games.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Explanation:
First, we need to convert the time units to a common unit. Let's use seconds.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so peeling a potato takes 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds.  Cutting a potato takes 5 seconds.

The total time to prepare one potato is 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, the total time to prepare all the potatoes is 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

To convert this back to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Cost of the CDs:** James initially bought 10 CDs, and each cost $15. So the total cost would have been 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150.

2. **Discount:** He got a 40% discount, meaning he saved 40% of $150.  That's 0.40 * $150 = $60.

3. **Amount paid:** Therefore, he actually paid $150 - $60 = $90 for all 10 CDs.

4. **Money from selling CDs:** He sold 5 CDs for $40.

5. **Net loss:** He spent $90 and received $40, resulting in a net loss of $90 - $40 = $50.

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Seats:** The auditorium has 4 rows with 18 seats each, so there are 4 * 18 = 72 total seats.

2. **Administrators' Seats:** One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is (1/4) * 72 = 18 seats.

3. **Remaining Seats:** After the administrators, there were 72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining.

4. **Parents' Seats:** One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, which is (1/3) * 54 = 18 seats.

5. **Students' Seats:** The rest of the seats were occupied by students, which is 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Total chips:** Milo has two bags of chips, each containing 72 chips.  Therefore, he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 glass chips.

2. **Chips per square inch:** Each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 glass chips.

3. **Total square inches:** Milo can make 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches of mosaic.

4. **Area of the mosaic:** The mosaic is 3 inches tall, and we know the area is 12 square inches.  The area of a rectangle (which we'll assume the mosaic is) is length * width.  Therefore, the length of the mosaic is 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","Explanation:
If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will have $450 in car damage.

If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he'll spend 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75 on asphalt.  He'll also be fined $120 by the city council.  This makes his total cost $75 + $120 = $195.

The difference between the cost of not fixing the pothole and fixing it is $450 - $195 = $255.  This is how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","Here's how to calculate the total cost of replacing Michael's bedroom carpet:

**1. Calculate the area of the bedroom:**

* Area = length × width = 18 feet × 12 feet = 216 square feet

**2. Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**

* Removal cost = area × removal cost per square foot = 216 sq ft × $4/sq ft = $864

**3. Calculate the cost of the new carpet:**

* Carpet cost = area × carpet cost per square foot = 216 sq ft × $12/sq ft = $2592

**4. Calculate the cost of the padding:**

* Padding cost = area × padding cost per square foot = 216 sq ft × $2/sq ft = $432

**5. Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:**

* Installation cost = area × installation cost per square foot = 216 sq ft × $34/sq ft = $7344

**6. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost = removal cost + carpet cost + padding cost + installation cost

10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Joanne's apples:** Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees, and an unknown number (let's call it 'x') from the average trees.  Her total is 30 + 15 + x.

2. **Sister's apples:** Joanne's sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees and 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees. Her total is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

3. **Combined apples:** Together, they gathered 500 apples.  So, Joanne's total plus her sister's total equals 500: (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500

4. **Solve for x:** Simplify the equation: 145 + x = 500. Subtract 145 from both sides: x = 500 - 145 = 355

Therefore, Joanne gathered 355 apples from the average trees.

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Here's how to solve Pat's flower bed problem step-by-step:

1. **Convert units:** The flower bed length is in feet, but the plant width is in inches. Let's convert the plant width to feet: 12 inches * (1 foot / 12 inches) = 1 foot.  So each plant takes up 1 foot of space.

2. **Space between plants:** Pat needs 1.5 feet of space between each plant.  Therefore, each plant and its spacing requires 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

3. **Number of plants:** The flower bed is 111 feet long.  To find the number of plants Pat can fit, we divide the total length by the space needed per plant: 111 feet / 2.5 feet/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can only buy whole plants, she can fit 44 plants.

4. **Plants to buy:** Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

5. **Total cost:** Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 plants * $6/plant = $162.

He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total time spent boating and swimming:** John spent 6 hours boating and 6/2 = 3 hours swimming, for a total of 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

2. **Calculate total time spent watching shows:** John watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate total time spent on boating, swimming and shows:**  He spent a total of 9 + 6 = 15 hours on these activities.

4. **Determine the percentage of total time spent on boating, swimming and shows:** This represents 30% of his total vacation time.  Therefore, 30% of his vacation time equals 15 hours.

5. **Calculate total vacation time:** To find the total vacation time, divide the time spent (15 hours) by the percentage (30% or 0.30): 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

6. **Calculate sightseeing time:** John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing.  Therefore, he spent 0.40 * 50 hours = 20 hours sightseeing.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Chalk remaining after Monday:**

* The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
* He used 45% of the chalk on Monday: 5 inches * 0.45 = 2.25 inches
* He has 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches of chalk remaining.

**2. Chalk usage per day:**

* The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day (after Monday).

**3. Days until recycling:**

* We need to determine how many days it takes to reduce the remaining 2.75 inches to 2 inches.
* Let 'x' be the number of days.  The amount of chalk remaining after x days can be represented by the equation:  2.75 * (1 - 0.20)^x ≥ 2
* Solving for x requires logarithms, which is complex for this scenario. Let's use an iterative approach:
    * Day 1: 2.75 inches * 0.80 = 2.2 inches (already below 2 inches)

**4. Final Answer:**

The teacher has only 1 more day before the chalk needs to be recycled.

16,"Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?","First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.  The volume of a rectangular prism (like a pool) is length x width x height.  So the volume of the pool is 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons. The pool company says to multiply the cubic feet by 5.9 to get the number of gallons. So, 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool.  The cost is $0.10 per gallon, and we need 8260 gallons, so the total cost will be 8260 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $826.

Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Kelly's total distance:**

* **First run:** Kelly runs the length of the field once, which is 100 yards.
* **Subsequent runs:** She runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.  Each of these runs covers 40 + 40 = 80 yards.  So, her total distance for these runs is 80 yards/run * 34 runs = 2720 yards.
* **Kelly's total:** Her total distance is 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

**2. Calculate Blake's total distance:**

* Blake runs back and forth 15 times.  Each back-and-forth run covers 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards.
* **Blake's total:** His total distance is 200 yards/run * 15 runs = 3000 yards.

**3. Determine the winner and the difference:**

* Blake ran farther than Kelly (3000 yards > 2820 yards).
* The difference in their distances is 3000 - 2820 = 180 yards.

If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","First, we need to determine the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.

* **Days remaining in December:** 31 (days in December) - 31 (current day) = 0 days
* **Days in January:** 31 days
* **Days in February:** 28 days (assuming a non-leap year)
* **Days in March:** 31 days
* **Days in April:** 30 days

28,"Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. During the week he made $105. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate daily earnings:** Felix made $105 over the week (7 days), so he made $105 / 7 days = $15 per day.

2. **Calculate branches per dollar:** Each branch costs $0.25, meaning he climbs 1/$0.25 = 4 branches per dollar earned.

3. **Calculate total branches per day:**  Since he earned $15 per day, he climbed 4 branches/dollar * $15/day = 60 branches per day.

29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","Here's how to solve Garrett's popcorn problem step-by-step:

**1. Popping in the first 30 seconds:**

* 20 kernels popped.

**2. Popping in the second 30 seconds:**

* The popping rate quadrupled from the initial rate.  The initial rate was 20 kernels / 30 seconds = 2/3 kernels per second.
* The rate in the second 30 seconds was 4 * (2/3) = 8/3 kernels per second.
* In 30 seconds, 8/3 kernels/second * 30 seconds = 80 kernels popped.

**3. Popping in the final 30 seconds:**

* The rate in the second 30 seconds was 8/3 kernels per second.
* The rate in the final 30 seconds is half of that: (8/3) / 2 = 4/3 kernels per second.
* In 30 seconds, 4/3 kernels/second * 30 seconds = 40 kernels popped.

**4. Popping from residual heat:**

* A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from residual heat: 40 kernels / 4 = 10 kernels.

**5. Total popcorn:**

* Total kernels popped: 20 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 150 kernels.

Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Pepper Cost:** Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Watermelon Cost:** A watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

3. **Orange Cost:** An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

4. **Total Cost:**
    * Watermelons: 4 watermelons * $45/watermelon = $180
    * Peppers: 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300
    * Oranges: 10 oranges * $40/orange = $400

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the weight of each feed type:**

* **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
* **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

2. **Calculate the total weight of all feed:**

* Total weight = 2 pounds + 1300 pounds + 3150 pounds + 48 pounds = 4500 pounds

3. **Determine the number of trips:**

* The truck carries 2250 pounds per trip.

36,"Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the first race, he lost $5. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","First, let's calculate how much Johnny's dad won in the second race.  He lost $5 in the first race, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

Next, let's calculate how much he lost in the third race. He lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now let's find his total winnings and losses. He won $11 and lost $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.  This means he lost a net of $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

Finally, we calculate his average loss per race.  He participated in 3 races, so his average loss was $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate playtime for each friend type:**

* **Jack:** Plays for 20 minutes per quarter.
* **Worse friends (2):** Play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
* **Better friend (1):** Plays for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

**2. Calculate total playtime in minutes:**

* The group plays for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

**3. Determine the number of quarters used by each friend type:**

To do this, we need to figure out how many games each player would play in 240 minutes.  Since they're playing simultaneously, we need to consider the *least* efficient player to figure out how many *total* games are being played in the 4 hour period.

* **The least efficient player** plays 10 minutes per quarter, so in 240 minutes they play 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 games.
* Because everyone is playing simultaneously, this means *everyone* is playing a total of 24 games in the 4-hour session.

**4. Calculate the number of quarters for each friend:**

* **Jack:** 24 games * 1 quarter/game = 24 quarters
* **Worse friends (2):** 24 games/person * 1 quarter/game = 24 quarters each = 48 quarters total
* **Better friend (1):** 24 games * 1 quarter/game = 24 quarters

**5. Calculate the total number of quarters used:**

* Total quarters = 24 + 48 + 24 = 96 quarters

**6. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost = 96 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $24

A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"Here's how to solve Mike's movie replacement cost:

**1. Series Movies:**

* Mike has 600 movies, and 1/3 are in series: (1/3) * 600 = 200 series movies.
* The cost of series movies is 200 movies * $6/movie = $1200

**2. Non-Series Movies:**

* Mike has 600 - 200 = 400 non-series movies.
* 40% of these are older movies: 0.40 * 400 = 160 older movies.
* The remaining non-series movies are: 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies.

**3. Cost of Non-Series Movies:**

* Cost of older movies: 160 movies * $5/movie = $800
* Cost of newer movies: 240 movies * $10/movie = $2400

**4. Total Cost:**

* Total cost of replacing movies = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of newer movies 
* Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

He's already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?","Here's how to calculate the number of hours George needs to work:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the implants:** Two implants cost 2 * $2000 = $4000.

2. **Calculate the cost of the crowns:** One porcelain crown costs $500, and another crown (presumably a standard one, since the problem doesn't specify otherwise) also costs $500, for a total of $1000.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:** The total cost is $4000 (implants) + $1000 (crowns) = $5000.

4. **Subtract the deposit:** George has already paid $600, so he still needs to pay $5000 - $600 = $4400.

5. **Calculate the number of hours needed:** To find out how many hours George needs to work, divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage: $4400 / $15/hour = 293.33 hours.

Since George can't work a fraction of an hour, he needs to work 294 hours to have enough money.

51,"Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","Answer: First, Rose picks 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals.
Then she picks 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.
Next, she picks 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.
She then drops 1 of each type, so she loses 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 flowers.  This is a loss of 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals.
After dropping flowers, she has 15 + 24 + 20 - 15 = 44 petals.
Finally, she picks 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals.
She drops 1 flower, losing 7 petals.

53,"Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find Carlos's seashells:** Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than Carlos.  Therefore, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

2. **Find Carrey's seashells:** Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.  So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

3. **Find the total number of seashells:** In total, they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

4. **Find the number of seashells per person after dividing equally:** They divided the seashells equally among the three of them, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

54,"Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Bees leaving in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees left the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the second 6 hours:** Half as many bees returned as left in the first 6 hours, so 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.

3. **Bees leaving in the third 6 hours:** Twice as many bees left as left in the first 6 hours, so 30 * 2 = 60 bees left.

4. **Bees that hadn't returned by the third 6 hours:**  In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left. In the second 6 hours, 15 returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees hadn't returned.

5. **Bees returning in the last 6 hours:** All the remaining bees from the first 6 hours returned (15 bees) plus all the bees that left in the third 6-hour period also returned.   Therefore, 15 + 60 = 75 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

55,"Buford writes many checks every year.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?","Explanation:
Let's break down the number of checks Buford writes per year:

* **Gas bill:** 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
* **Pest and lawn service:** 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year
* **Electric bill:** 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
* **Church:** 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we sum up the checks for each expense: 12 + 4 + 12 + 24 = 52 checks.  We are not given information about the number of ""many checks"" he writes annually, so we can only account for the specified bills.

56,"Mr. Tan paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","Here's how to calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds:

1. **Calculate transfer fees:** Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, so 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

2. **Calculate brokerage fees:** Brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price, so 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

3. **Calculate total fees:** The total fees are the sum of transfer and brokerage fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

4. **Calculate amount received after fees:** Mr. Tan received $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000 after paying the fees.

5. **Calculate net proceeds:**  To find his net proceeds, subtract the remaining loan amount from the amount received after fees: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

57,"Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. If Tobias howls for 'x' seconds, Chikote howls for '2x' seconds.

2. **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.  Therefore, Igneous howls for x + 2x = 3x seconds.

3. **Tobias's howl length:** We know each of Tobias's howls lasts 20 seconds.  We need more information to determine the number of times Tobias howls.  Let's assume it is 'n' times. Then Tobias's total howl time is 20n seconds.

4. **Determining 'x':** Since Tobias's howl time is 20n seconds, we can say x = 20n seconds.

5. **Total howl time:** The combined howl time of the three wolves is 20n + 2(20n) + 3(20n) = 20n + 40n + 60n = 120n seconds.

6. **Converting to minutes:** To convert the total howl time to minutes, we divide by 60: (120n seconds) / 60 seconds/minute = 2n minutes.

**Without knowing how many times Tobias howls (n), we cannot get a numerical answer.**  The problem is incomplete.  To find a numerical answer, we would need the total number of howls by Tobias.

58,"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt.  A 30% discount on a $25 shirt means he saves 0.30 * $25 = $7.50.  Therefore, the shirt costs him $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the cost of the shirt and shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Finally, we see that the total cost ($52.50) exceeds the amount of money Joe has ($50).  Therefore, Joe will not have any money left after his purchase; he will be short $2.50.  However, the question asks how much money he will *have* left.

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Clara's Purchase (Tuesday):**

* Cost per pomegranate: $20
* Number of pomegranates: 20
* Total cost before discount: 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400
* Discount: $2

**Sheila's Purchase (Wednesday):**

* Cost per pomegranate: $30
* Number of pomegranates: 20
* Total cost before discount: 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600
* Discount: 10% of $600 = $60

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Middle Shelves:** Two middle shelves hold a total of 2 * 10 = 20 books.

2. **Bottom Shelf:** The bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it holds 2 * 10 = 20 books.

3. **Top Shelf:** The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, meaning it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

4. **Total Books per Bookcase:** One bookcase holds 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Next, calculate the calories from the cheese: 2 oz cheese * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Then, calculate the calories from the ham:  Since John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, he uses 2 oz of ham.  2 oz ham * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  The returned item cost $15.00. What is the new balance on her credit card?","First, calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 discount, so the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, calculate the cost of the towels after the 10% discount: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 discount, so the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Then, add the cost of the frying pan and towels: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Now, subtract the returned item from the original charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

64,Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day. The plane tickets cost $5000 each. If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?,"First, calculate the cost of the hotel for one day during the busy weekend.  The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500, so the increased cost is 20% of $1500, which is (20/100) * $1500 = $300.  Therefore, the cost per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Next, calculate the total hotel cost for the 3-day stay: $1800/day * 3 days = $5400.

Then, calculate the total cost of the plane tickets for two people: $5000/person * 2 people = $10000.

He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?","Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week. He divides his work equally between Publisher A and Publisher B, meaning he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.  Therefore, Mark earns 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays twice the rate of Publisher A, so Publisher B pays 5 cents/sentence * 2 = 10 cents/sentence.  Therefore, Mark earns 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

Mark's total weekly earnings are 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

How many friends can she invite?","Here's how to solve Morgan's birthday party budget problem:

1. **Go-Kart Cost:** Go-karts cost $10 per ride and she wants two rides, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.

2. **Arcade Tokens:** She wants $5 in arcade tokens.

3. **Total Spent on Rides and Tokens:** Combining the go-kart and arcade costs: $20 + $5 = $25.

4. **Money Left for Mini-Golf:** Subtracting the ride and token costs from her budget: $90 - $25 = $65.

If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?","First, we need to calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to feed. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, making a total of 15 people.  Each team member brings 2 guests, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  Adding the guests to the team members and coaches, there are 15 + 24 = 39 people in total.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas Maddy needs.  Each pizza serves 3 people, so she needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","Here's how to solve this step-by-step:

1. **Betty's points:** Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, who has 50 points.  30% of 50 is (30/100) * 50 = 15 points.  Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

2. **Tom's points:** Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

3. **Martha's points:** Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, who has 35 points.  Therefore, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

4. **Total class points:** The total points collected by the class are 50 (Adam) + 105 (Martha) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) = 255 points.

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Fish after the purchase:** Bob started with 7 fish (3 orange + 4 white) and bought 17 more, giving him a total of 7 + 17 = 24 fish.

2. **Relationship between orange and white fish:** Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  Let's represent the number of white fish as 'x'.  This means he has '2x' orange fish.

3. **Equation:** The total number of fish is 24, so we can write the equation: x + 2x = 24

4. **Solving for x:** This simplifies to 3x = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 8.  This means Bob now has 8 white fish.

5. **White fish purchased:** Since Bob started with 4 white fish and now has 8, he must have bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the pet store.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total output of the first four workers:** Two workers produce 6 toys/hour each, and two workers produce 4 toys/hour each.  In a 10-hour shift, these four workers produce: (2 * 6 toys/hour + 2 * 4 toys/hour) * 10 hours = (12 + 8) * 10 = 200 toys

2. **Calculate the remaining toys:** The manufacturer received an order for 400 toys and needs 20 more to complete the order. This means they produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

3. **Determine the fifth worker's total output:** The fifth worker produced 380 toys (total output) - 200 toys (output of the first four workers) = 180 toys.

He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"Here's how to solve Tim's jelly bean estimation problem:

**1. Calculate the volume of the jar:**

* The jar is a rectangular prism (a box).  The volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.
* Volume = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**2. Account for packing efficiency:**

* The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is actually filled with jelly beans.
* Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**

* Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.
* Total number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans:**

* 30% of the jelly beans are estimated to be red.
* Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 jelly beans

80,"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the original price of jogger jeans:** The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so their original price was $28 - $6 = $22.

2. **Calculate the total original cost:** The total original cost of both pairs of jeans was $28 + $22 = $50.

3. **Find the amount saved on jogger jeans:** Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings ($6) on the jogger jeans, so he saved (1/3) * $6 = $2 on the jogger jeans.

4. **Find the amount saved on tattered jeans:**  He saved the remaining amount on the tattered jeans, which is $6 - $2 = $4.

5. **Find the sale price of each pair of jeans:** The sale price of the jogger jeans was $22 - $2 = $20, and the sale price of the tattered jeans was $28 - $4 = $24.

6. **Calculate the difference in original prices:** The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and tattered jeans is $28 - $22 = $6.

81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","First, we need to find the value of the loan John received.  His loan is 40% of his house's value, which is $250,000.  So, the loan amount is 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.

Next, we determine how much of the loan John used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan for this purpose.  This amount is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Finally, we calculate the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts. This is the loan amount minus the amount used to pay off debts: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

82,"An air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Cooling on Low:**

* The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
* Total cooling on low: 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

**2. Cooling on High:**

* The air conditioner ran on high for 4 hours at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
* Total cooling on high: 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

**3. Warming Up:**

* The air conditioner was off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour.
* Total warming: 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

**4. Net Change in Temperature:**

* Total cooling: 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees
* Total warming: 4 degrees
* Net change: 18 degrees (cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","Here's how to solve Millie's lemonade stand profit problem:

**1. Total Cups of Lemonade:**

**4. Total Profit:**

* Her total profit is $36 (revenue) - $18 (costs) = $18

**5. Hours of Operation:**

* She sells 4 cups per hour, and has 36 cups to sell, so she works for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

**6. Profit per Hour:**

85,"Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party. He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Lemons per gallon:** Tim needs 6 lemons for 1 cup of juice, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of juice per gallon.  Therefore, he needs 6 lemons per gallon of regular lemonade.

2. **Lemons for the party:** He needs 4 gallons for the party, so that's 6 lemons/gallon * 4 gallons = 24 lemons.

3. **Lemons for Allen:** He needs an extra gallon for Allen, twice as tart.  This means he needs twice the amount of lemon juice, so he needs 2 cups of lemon juice for Allen's gallon of lemonade. Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, he needs 12 lemons (2 cups * 6 lemons/cup) for Allen's gallon.

4. **Total lemons:** In total, Tim needs 24 lemons (for the party) + 12 lemons (for Allen) = 36 lemons.

86,Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. The first friend says 80. What is their average guess?,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **First friend's guess:** The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second friend's guess:** The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess.  Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.

3. **Third friend's guess:** The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is (25/100) * 80 = 20.  So the third friend guesses 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

4. **Calculate the average:** To find the average guess, add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

Therefore, the average guess of the three friends is 80.

Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"First, we need to calculate Ryan's total allowance.  He did his chores for 3 weeks and received $6 per week, so he earned 3 weeks * $6/week = $18.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream cones. He bought cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 cones total.  The cost was 4 cones * $1.25/cone = $5.

Now we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.  This is the amount of money he has left for movie tickets.

109,"Fred was preparing for a party to be held in four days.  So, he made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?","Answer: On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
That evening, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.
On the fourth day, there were 3 people at the party (Fred, plus 2 others).
Therefore, each person got 8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons of root beer.  Rounding to the nearest hundredth, this is approximately 2.67 gallons.

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Here's how to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

**1. Probability of needing to turn in homework with the normal teacher:**

* There's a 60% chance the normal teacher *won't* give an extension (100% - 40% = 60%).
* Even without an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can get a personal extension.
* Therefore, the probability Marcus needs to turn in his homework with the normal teacher is 60% * (100% - 20%) = 60% * 80% = 48%.

**2. Probability of needing to turn in homework with a substitute teacher:**

* There's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher.
* The substitute will collect the homework.
* So the probability of needing to turn in homework with a substitute is 50%.

**3. Overall probability of needing to turn in homework:**

* There's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher and a 50% chance of needing to turn in homework in that case.
* There's a 50% chance of the normal teacher and a 48% chance of needing to turn in homework in that case.

Therefore, the total probability is (50% * 50%) + (50% * 48%) = 25% + 24% = 49%

112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Here's how to solve Lorraine's sticker-button trade:

**1. Calculate large sticker trades:**

* Lorraine has 40 large stickers.
* She trades 50% (40 * 0.5 = 20) for large buttons.  Each large sticker gets her one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.
* She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker gets her three small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

**2. Calculate small sticker trades:**

* Lorraine has 30 small stickers.
* She trades 90% (30 * 0.9 = 27) for large buttons. Each three small stickers gets her one large button, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

**3. Calculate total buttons:**

* Lorraine has 20 large buttons from large sticker trades + 9 large buttons from small sticker trades = 29 large buttons.
* She has 60 small buttons from large sticker trades.
* Therefore, her total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons.  

**4.Express in terms of small buttons only (optional but can help avoid confusion) :**

* If a large button is worth 3 small buttons, and she has 29 large buttons, they are equivalent to 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.
* Adding the 60 small buttons, her total is equivalent to 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

1. **Letters per week:** Mike has 3 pen pals (5 - 2) and each sends 2 letters a week.  That's 3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal = 6 letters per week.

2. **Pages per letter:** Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 6 letters/week * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages per week received.

3. **Pages to respond:** Mike responds to each letter, meaning he writes another 30 pages per week.

4. **Total pages per week:**  This means Mike writes a total of 30 + 30 = 60 pages per week.

5. **Minutes per week:** Since he writes a page every 6 minutes, he spends 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes writing per week.

6. **Hours per week:** Converting to hours, he spends 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours writing letters per week.

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Situation:** James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. **First Delivery:** 8 more dogs arrive, so he needs 4 + 8 = 12 toys.  Let's assume he buys enough toys to bring the total to 12.

3. **Second Delivery:** The number of dogs doubles, so there are now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.  This means he needs 24 toys. He buys 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

4. **Third Visit:** 3 dogs leave, reducing the number of dogs to 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.  Therefore, he needs 21 toys.  The number of toys he already has is 24, so he no longer needs 24 - 21 = 3 toys.

5. **Total Toys Needed:**  To find the total number of toys James needed, we add up the toys he bought: 12 + 12 = 24 toys. The 3 extra toys are no longer needed and thus removed from the total.

The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"To determine the cost, we first need to figure out how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make.  Since each sandwich serves 4 people, and there are 20 people, he needs 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.  Therefore, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.
The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

The total cost for the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Extra-small:** We know 11 students need extra-small shirts.

2. **Small:** Twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need small shirts.

3. **Medium:** Four less than the number of small students need medium shirts, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.

4. **Large:** Half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.

5. **Extra-large:** Six more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

6. **Total:** To find the total number of shirts, add the number of shirts needed for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

139,"Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Let's break down Tanya's salt scrub recipe step by step to find the amount of oil she uses.

1. **Citrus zest and fragrance:** Tanya uses equal amounts of citrus zest and fragrance. Let's represent this amount with the variable 'x'.  So, zest = x ounces, and fragrance = x ounces.

2. **Salt and sugar:** Tanya uses equal amounts of salt and sugar. Let's represent this amount with the variable 'y'. So, salt = y ounces, and sugar = y ounces.

3. **Oil and salt:** Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.  This means oil = 2y ounces.

4. **Salt and zest:** Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest.  This means y = 2x.  Solving for x, we get x = y/2.

5. **Total ounces:** The total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces.  Therefore:  2y + y + y/2 + y/2 + y = 10

6. **Solving for y:** Combining like terms in the equation above, we get 5y = 10. Solving for y, we find that y = 2 ounces.  This means Tanya uses 2 ounces of salt and 2 ounces of sugar.

7. **Solving for oil:** Since oil = 2y, and y = 2, Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

140,"Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?","First, calculate the amount of soil used for sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

Next, calculate the amount of soil used for carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

Then, find the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

Finally, subtract the amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil to find out how much soil is left for roses: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

141,"A bus has a capacity of 200 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Before its first stop, it had 20 people. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","Here's how to solve this step-by-step:

1. **Passengers after the first stop:** The bus started with 20 people and 40 more boarded, resulting in 20 + 40 = 60 passengers.

2. **Passengers after the second stop:** At the second stop, (3/4) * 40 = 30 more people boarded.  This brings the total to 60 + 30 = 90 passengers.

3. **Passengers after the third stop:** The number of passengers doubled, so there are now 90 * 2 = 180 passengers.

4. **Remaining spaces:** The bus has a capacity of 200, and there are currently 180 passengers. Therefore, there are 200 - 180 = 20 remaining spaces.

160,"A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate bandages at the end of day 1:**

* They started day 1 with 50 bandages (one bulk pack).
* They used 38 bandages.
* They had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of day 1.

**2. Calculate bandages used on day 2:**

* They used 10 fewer bandages on day 2 than day 1.
* They used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on day 2.

**3. Calculate bandages at the end of day 2:**

* They started day 2 with 12 bandages.
* They used 28 bandages.  This means they needed to order more bandages. Since there is no information about ordering more bandages on day 2, we will assume that they did order more bandages on day 2.
* They had 50 (from the order) +12 - 28 = 34 bandages left at the end of day 2.

**4. Calculate bandages used on day 3:**

* They ordered two bulk packs, or 100 bandages on day 3.
* They ended the day with 78 bandages.
* They used 100 + 34 - 78 = 56 bandages on day 3.
* This also means they used half a pack, or 25 bandages.  The discrepancy between these two numbers suggests an error in the problem's description.

**5. Reconcile the discrepancy and find the original number:**

The problem states that 56 bandages were used and 25 bandages were used. It's likely that the 25 bandages refer to an amount *in addition* to the bandages already used and still leaving 78 bandages at the end of the day.  Let's assume this is the case. Then the number of bandages used on day 3 was 56 - 25 = 31 bandages.

Let's recalculate working backward from the end of day 3, accounting for the discrepancy:

* **End of Day 3:** 78 bandages
* **Start of Day 3:** 78 + 31 = 109 bandages (this includes the 100 from the order)
* **End of Day 2:** 109 - 100 = 9 bandages.
* **Start of Day 2:** 9 + 28 = 37 bandages
* **End of Day 1:** 37 - 50 = -13 bandages. The negative value here reveals the provided information may be inconsistent.


**Conclusion:**  The information provided in the problem is contradictory. There's no solution that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. We can't determine the initial number of bandages based on the inconsistent data.  The problem needs correction.

He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7500. So, the leather seats cost (1/3) * $7500 = $2500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2500 - $500 = $2000.

The total cost of the added features is $7500 (king cab) + $2500 (leather seats) + $2000 (running boards) + $1500 (exterior lights) = $13500.

The total cost of Bill's truck is the base price plus the cost of the added features: $30000 + $13500 = $43500.

Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","First, we need to convert the distances to the same units.  Since Steve's biking speed is given in feet per minute, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

* **Tim's distance:** 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
* **Steve's distance:** 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Next, we calculate how long it takes each person to get home:

* **Tim's time:** 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes
* **Steve's time:** 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes.  Therefore, Tim will be waiting for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

2. **Find the time to shore:** The shore is 64 seconds away.

3. **Calculate the distance to shore:** Julia's speed is 1.25 feet/second, and she has 64 seconds to reach the shore, so the distance to shore is 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

4. **Calculate the water intake:** The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since Julia rowed 80 feet, the boat took on (80 feet / 10 feet/2 liters) * 2 liters = 16 liters of water.

164,"Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. When Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","Gissela's truck can haul 4000 pounds of gravel.
Gordy's truck hauls 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck hauls 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds.
Together, Gissela and Gordy's trucks haul 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.
The three trucks combined haul 11600 pounds, so Gary's truck hauls 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.

165,"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Holes at the end of the first day:** The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.

2. **Holes at the end of the second day:** They dug an additional 13 holes, so there were 10 + 13 = 23 holes at the end of the second day.

3. **Holes at the end of the third day:** They dug 8 holes, but filled in 2, resulting in a net increase of 8 - 2 = 6 holes.  Therefore, there were 23 + 6 = 29 holes at the end of the third day.

4. **Holes at the end of the fourth day:**  There were four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as at the end of the first day (10 holes).  This means there were 10 * 4 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

5. **Holes dug on the fourth day:** To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

166,"Mr. Robles' first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total bananas consumed per week:** Mr. Robles has enough bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days). Therefore, the total bananas consumed in a week are 315.

2. **Bananas eaten by the first monkey per week:** The first monkey eats 10 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 70 bananas per week.

3. **Bananas eaten by the second monkey per day and per week:** The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.  This means the second monkey eats 14 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 98 bananas per week.

4. **Bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per week:**  Together, the first two monkeys eat 70 + 98 = 168 bananas per week.

5. **Bananas eaten by the third monkey per week:** The third monkey eats the remaining bananas, which is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas per week.

6. **Bananas eaten by the third monkey per day:** Finally, the third monkey eats 147 bananas/week / 7 days/week = 21 bananas per day.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Straw for hamsters:** There are 10 hamsters, each getting 5 pieces of straw, for a total of 10 hamsters * 5 straws/hamster = 50 straws.

2. **Straw for rabbits:** 20 pieces of straw were used for the rabbits.

3. **Straw for rats:** The total straw used was 160, and 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 pieces were used for hamsters and rabbits.  Therefore, 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw were used for the rats.

4. **Rats per cage:** Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.  Since there are 90 pieces of straw for the rats, there are 90 straws / 6 straws/rat = 15 rats in total.

5. **Rats per cage:** The rats are divided equally among 3 cages, so there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

The sales assistant told Erika that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. The laptop Erika wants costs $600. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the final cost of the laptop:** The laptop initially costs $600, but with the trade-in discount of $200, the final cost is $600 - $200 = $400.

2. **Calculate the total amount Erika needs to save:**  Erika needs $400 for the laptop, and she already has $80 from her mom and $150 from her job, totaling $80 + $150 = $230. So she still needs $400 - $230 = $170.

3. **Determine the amount of money in her purse:** The problem states that Erika only needs an additional $50 after receiving money from her mom and job. This means that she already has $170 - $50 = $120 in her purse.

Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore.  Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.","Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Amalia's time:** Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

**2. Dior's time:** Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.  This means Dior took more than 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do the laundry.  However, the problem states Dior took ""well over"" 4 hours longer, but we don't know the exact amount of time beyond 8 hours. The problem does not provide enough information to find the exact amount of time Dior spent doing laundry.  We only know it's greater than 8 hours.


**3. Megan's time:** Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

**4. Total time (with incomplete information):** We can only calculate a minimum total time.  Amalia (4 hours) + Megan (6 hours) + Dior (at least 8 hours) = at least 18 hours.

Since we lack the precise time Dior spent on laundry, we cannot determine the exact total time.  Therefore, we can only give the minimum total time.

177,"A shop sells school supplies. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10.  How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?","Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of each item without the discount:

* **Notebooks:** 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
* **Pens:** 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
* **Calculator:** 1 calculator * $12/calculator = $12.00
* **Geometry Set:** 1 geometry set * $10/geometry set = $10.00

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:

Final cost = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Cards collected in the first month:**

* Elaine started with 20 cards.  In the first month, she collected some number of cards (let's call this 'x').

**2. Cards collected in the second month:**

* In the second month, she collected three times the number she started with (20 * 3 = 60).

The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","Here's how to solve this step-by-step:

**1. First Train:** Arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.  Leaves at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

**2. Second Train:** Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes). Stays for 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Leaves at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

**3. Third Train:** Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes). Leaves immediately (at 125 minutes).

**4. Fourth Train:** Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes).

**Total Wait Time:** Paul starts waiting at time zero. His train arrives at 145 minutes.  Therefore, Paul waits for 145 minutes.

What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Mr. Rogers' purchase price:** The watch was originally $2000, but Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of that price.  So, he paid 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The total cost for the first venue is the flat fee plus the cost of food per guest:  200 + 5x

The total cost for the second venue is the cost per guest: 25x

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 10

Therefore, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's use variables to represent the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

* **x:** Number of balls retrieved in the second set.
* **x/2:** Number of balls retrieved in the third set (half as many as the second).
* **x + 4:** Number of balls retrieved in the first set (four more than the second).

The total number of balls retrieved is 19:

x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19

Now we solve for x:

* Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.

Now we find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Sally's hourly rate:**

* Billy's starting hourly rate: $10
* Sally's starting hourly rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50

**2. Billy's hourly rate after raises:**

* After 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50
* After 1 year: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

**3. Billy's total earnings after 2 months:**

* Since he worked 20 hours a month and we're considering the 2 months before his first raise, this is the earning period when he earns at the $10 rate. 2 months * 20 hours/month = 40 hours. Therefore his total earnings are $10/hour * 40 hours = $400.

**4. Billy's total earnings after 1 year:**

* The period between 2 months and 1 year, Billy earns at $10.50/hour. That's (12 months - 2 months) * 20 hours/month = 200 hours at this rate. Thus his earnings in this period is $10.50/hour * 200 hours = $2100.
* For the remaining time in the year to reach the first anniversary (12 months -2 months = 10 months), he earns at $11.50/hour.  This is 10 months * 20 hours/month = 200 hours. Thus earnings in this period is $11.50/hour * 200 hours = $2300.

**5. Billy's total earnings for the year:**

* Total earnings for the year: $400 + $2100 + $2300 = $4800

**6. Sally's total earnings for the year:**

* Sally's hourly rate: $10.50
* Sally's total earnings for the year: $10.50/hour * (12 months * 20 hours/month) = $2520

**7. Difference in earnings:**

* Difference: $4800 - $2520 = $2280

**1. Annual Lemon Income:**

* The tree produces 7 lemons per year.
* Each lemon sells for $1.50.
* Therefore, the annual income from lemons is 7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50.

**2. Annual Expenses:**

* It costs $3 per year to maintain the tree.

**3. Net Annual Profit:**

* The net profit each year is the income minus the expenses: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

**4.  Years to Recover Initial Cost:**

* The initial cost of planting the tree is $90.
* To determine how many years it takes to recover this cost, divide the initial cost by the annual profit: $90 / $7.50/year = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning a net profit from the lemon tree.

The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Cost of balloons:** The balloons cost $0.50 for 2, so a dozen (12) balloons cost (12/2) * $0.50 = $3.

2. **Cost of ice cream:** Two tubs of ice cream cost 2 * $7 = $14.

220,"A large t-shirt is 6 square feet of fabric. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A medium t-shirt is 4 square feet of fabric. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?","Here's how to calculate the total square footage of Octavia's quilt:

**1. Calculate the area of the small t-shirts:**

* Area of one small t-shirt: 3 square feet
* Number of small t-shirts: 11
* Total area of small t-shirts: 3 square feet/shirt * 11 shirts = 33 square feet

**2. Calculate the area of the medium t-shirts:**

* Area of one medium t-shirt: 4 square feet
* Number of medium t-shirts: 8
* Total area of medium t-shirts: 4 square feet/shirt * 8 shirts = 32 square feet

**3. Calculate the area of the large t-shirts:**

* Area of one large t-shirt: 6 square feet
* Number of large t-shirts: 6
* Total area of large t-shirts: 6 square feet/shirt * 6 shirts = 36 square feet

**4. Calculate the total area of the quilt:**

* Total area: 33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Trey's laps:** Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany, who runs 10 laps. So Trey runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

2. **Shaelyn's laps:** Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey, so she runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

3. **Quinn's laps:** Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

4. **Bethany vs. Quinn:** Bethany runs 10 laps and Quinn runs 5 laps.  Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"Here's how to solve Frederick's popsicle stick problem:

**1. Cost per stick:**

* **2x4:** $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick
* **2x8:** $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

The 2x8 lumber is cheaper per stick.

**2. Maximum sticks from 2x8:**

With $24, Frederick can buy $24 / $6 per 2x8 = 4 pieces of 2x8 lumber.

**3. Total sticks:**

4 pieces of 2x8 lumber will yield 4 pieces * 400 sticks/piece = 1600 popsicle sticks.

223,"Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","Answer: Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken.  Ellen's brother took 3 sodas in total, leaving 9.  Of those 9 sodas, 2 were shaken and 7 were not.  Ellen then took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 8 sodas in total, with 2 still shaken.  Therefore, the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed is 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"Zoey spits 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet total.
Sydney spits 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet total.
Together they spit 400 + 420 = 820 feet.
There are 40 + 35 = 75 seeds total.
The average distance is 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.933... feet/seed.  Rounding to the nearest tenth of a foot, the average total distance spat is 10.9 feet.

Answer: {10.9}

225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Determine the minimum temperature increase needed:**

* Donny needs the final mixture to be at least 40 degrees.
* He adds a total of 5 ounces to his water bottle (4 from the 33-degree mug and 1 from the unknown mug).

**2. Calculate the heat transfer:**

* Let 'x' be the temperature of the second mug.
* The heat gained by the 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug is negligible because it will be dominated by the addition of one ounce of warmer water from the unknown mug.
* We can approximate the problem by considering only the heat transferred from the one ounce added from the second mug.
* The temperature increase required to reach at least 40 degrees is at least 40-33=7 degrees.
* Since only 1 ounce is added, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 7 degrees warmer than the final mix of 40 degrees.

**3. Calculate the minimum temperature of the second mug:**

* To raise the 5-ounce total to 40 degrees, the 1 ounce of water from the unknown mug needs to raise the average temperature of the 5 ounce mix from 33 degrees to 40 degrees.
* We can set up a weighted average equation:  (4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 = 40
* Solving for x: 132 + x = 200;  x = 68

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

Answer: {68}

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Here's how to calculate the boat's value after three years of depreciation:

**Year 1:**

* Depreciation: 30% of $9000 = $2700
* Value after Year 1: $9000 - $2700 = $6300

**Year 2:**

* Depreciation: 30% of $6300 = $1890
* Value after Year 2: $6300 - $1890 = $4410

**Year 3:**

* Depreciation: 20% of $4410 = $882
* Value after Year 3: $4410 - $882 = $3528

227,"Each student in Marissa's class started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total pencils at the start:** There are 30 students, and each student starts with 10 pencils, so there are 30 * 10 = 300 pencils at the beginning of the year.

2. **Pencils used after two months:** 1/5 of the total pencils were used, which is (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

3. **Pencils remaining after two months:** After two months, there are 300 - 60 = 240 pencils remaining.

4. **Pencils left at the end of the year:** Only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left at the end of the year. This is (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, there were 80 pencils left at the end of the year.
