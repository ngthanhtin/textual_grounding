How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Reformatted Question: Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by <fact1>$50 each time</fact1> and <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2>. She accepts the opening bid of <fact3>$200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer: The opening bid is <fact3>$200</fact3>.  Since <fact2>three other people bid once</fact2> and the bids increase by <fact1>$50 each time</fact1>, the price increases by $50 × 3 = $150.  Therefore, Carmen wins the desk at $200 + $150 = $350.

For the third year he buys <fact2>4 games a month</fact2> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money. He also gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas every year</fact3>. He saves up enough money to buy <fact4>1 game per month for a year</fact4>, and then the second year he starts buying <fact5>2 games a month</fact5>. How many games does Steve have after 3 years?

Answer: Let's break down Steve's game acquisition year by year:

* **Year 1:** Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1> for his birthday. He then buys <fact4>1 game per month for 12 months</fact4>, adding 12 games.  He also receives <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>.  Total games at the end of Year 1: 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

* **Year 2:** Steve buys <fact5>2 games per month for 12 months</fact5>, adding 24 games. He also receives <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>. Total games at the end of Year 2: 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

* **Year 3:** Steve buys <fact2>4 games a month for 12 months</fact2>, adding 48 games. He receives <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>. Total games at the end of Year 3: 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

Therefore, Steve has a total of 104 games after 3 years.  The answer is {104}.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact2>a minute and a half</fact2> to peel a potato, but only about <fact3>5 seconds</fact3> to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer:  It takes Billy <fact2>1.5 minutes</fact2> (or 90 seconds) to peel each potato and <fact3>5 seconds</fact3> to cut each potato.  Therefore, it takes him 90 + 5 = 95 seconds to prepare one potato. Since he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to prepare, the total time will be 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.  Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>. He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>. Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>. He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>. How much money was he out?

Answer:  First, let's determine the original cost of the 10 CDs before the discount.  Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>, so 10 CDs would cost 10 * $15 = $150.

Next, consider the discount. James got <fact5>40% off</fact5>, meaning he paid 100% - 40% = 60% of the original price.  Therefore, he paid 0.60 * $150 = $90 for all 10 CDs.

He sold <fact2>5 CDs</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>.  This means he received $40 from the sale.

Now, let's focus on the CDs he didn't sell. He kept 10 - 5 = 5 CDs.  The cost of these 5 CDs was (5 CDs * $15/CD) * 0.60 = $45.

To calculate how much money he was out, we find the difference between the total amount he spent and the amount he received from the sale:

Total spent on all 10 CDs = $90
Money received from selling 5 CDs = $40
Money spent on unsold CDs = $45

Money he was out = ($90 - $40) + $45 = $95.  Therefore, James was out $95.  The answer is {95}.

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Reformatted Question:  There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1>. <fact2>One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators</fact2>. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents</fact3>, and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer:

First, let's find the total number of seats in the auditorium.  The auditorium has <fact4>4 rows</fact4> with <fact1>18 seats per row</fact1>, so there are 4 * 18 = 72 seats in total.

Next, let's determine how many seats were occupied by administrators.  <fact2>One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators</fact2>, so 72 * (1/4) = 18 seats were occupied by administrators.

Now, let's find the number of remaining seats after the administrators were seated. There were 72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining.

Then, let's find how many seats were occupied by parents. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents</fact3>, so 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats were occupied by parents.

Finally, to find the number of students, subtract the number of seats occupied by administrators and parents from the total number of seats: 72 - 18 - 18 = 36 seats were occupied by students.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Reformatted Question: A bag of glass chips holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>. It takes <fact3>twelve glass chips</fact3> to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer: Milo has <fact4>two bags</fact4> of glass chips, and each bag holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>, so he has a total of 2 * <fact1>72</fact1> = 144 chips.  His mosaic will be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>, and each square inch requires <fact3>twelve glass chips</fact3>. Therefore, the area of one inch of height of his mosaic is 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch / 3 inches = 4 square inches.  Since the area is length multiplied by height, and the height is 3 inches, the length of his mosaic will be 4 square inches / 3 inches = 4/3 inches. Since the area of the mosaic is 4 square inches per inch of height, and his mosaic will have a height of 3 inches, the total number of square inches in the mosaic is 4 square inches/inch * 3 inches = 12 square inches.  Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, to find the length, we divide the total area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches long. Therefore Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The answer is {4}.

6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Reformatted Question: Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The <fact2>first needs to walk 1 mile</fact2>. On average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The <fact4>second needs to walk 4 miles</fact4>. The <fact5>third needs to walk 3 miles</fact5>. How many miles does the last dog need?

Answer:  Bernie has <fact1>four dogs</fact1> and they need to walk a total of <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3> on average.  The first dog walks <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second walks <fact4>4 miles</fact4>, and the third walks <fact5>3 miles</fact5>.  To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles. Since the average is 3 miles per day for all four dogs, the total miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.  The answer is {4}.

7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","Reformatted Question: A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they <fact1>sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> and <fact2>2 of each of the fruity scents available</fact2>.

They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?

Answer: The number of vanilla scents sold is the number of vanilla scents available multiplied by the number sold per scent.  From <fact1>the question</fact1>, we know they sold 5 of each vanilla scent.  While <fact3>the question</fact3> states they had 4 vanilla scents, the number of vanilla scents sold is 5 vanilla scents/vanilla scent * 4 vanilla scents = 20 vanilla scents.

The number of fruity scents sold is calculated similarly.  According to <fact2>the question</fact2>, they sold 2 of each fruity scent.  Since there were <fact4>8 fruity scents available</fact4>, the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 fruity scents/fruity scent * 8 fruity scents = 16 fruity scents.

Therefore, the difference in sales is 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more vanilla scents sold than fruity scents. The answer is {4}.

8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","Reformatted Question: Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do <fact1>$450 worth of damage</fact1> to his car.

Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron <fact4>$120</fact4> for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Answer:  If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, the <fact1>damage to his car will cost him $450</fact1>.  If he fixes it himself, the cost of the <fact2>asphalt (3 buckets * $25/bucket)</fact2> will be $75, and he'll have to pay a <fact4>$120 fine</fact4>.  Therefore, fixing it himself will cost him $75 + $120 = $195. By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $450 (cost of car damage) - $195 (cost of self-repair) = $255.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","Reformatted Question: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom. His <fact1>bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>. His <fact2>contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet</fact2>, and <fact3>$34 per square foot to install the new carpet</fact3>. The <fact4>new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>. How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom:  <fact1>18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet</fact1>.

Next, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet: <fact2>$4/square foot * 216 square feet = $864</fact2>.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet: <fact4>$12/square foot * 216 square feet = $2592</fact4>.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the padding: <fact5>$2/square foot * 216 square feet = $432</fact5>.

The total cost of the new carpet and padding is $2592 + $432 = $3024.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of installing the new carpet: <fact3>$34/square foot * 216 square feet = $7344</fact3>.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the removal cost, the cost of the new carpet and padding, and the installation cost: $864 + $3024 + $7344 = $11232.

So, it will cost Michael $11232 to replace the carpet.  The answer is {11232}.

10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted Question: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and <fact3>more apples from the average trees</fact3>. Her sister gathers <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4> and <fact5>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5>. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of <fact6>500 apples</fact6>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>.  From the shortest trees, she gathers half this amount, which is 30/2 = <fact2>15 apples</fact2>. Her sister gathers <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4>, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and <fact5>3 times as many from the shortest trees</fact5>, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.  Together, the sisters gathered 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

Let's say 'x' represents the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees (<fact3>more apples from the average trees</fact3>).  The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is given as <fact6>500 apples</fact6>.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

150 + x + 60 + 45 = 500

Simplifying the equation:

255 + x = 500

Subtracting 255 from both sides:

x = 500 - 255

x = 245

Therefore, Joanne gathered 245 apples from the average trees. The answer is {245}.

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Reformatted Question: Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>. Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>. Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>. How much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: First, we need to determine the space each plant will occupy, including the spacing between them.  Pat's flowers are <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3>, which is equal to 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot.  Adding the <fact4>1.5 feet spacing</fact4> between each plant, each plant will occupy 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet of space.

Next, we calculate how many plants can fit in the <fact1>111-foot-long</fact1> flower bed.  Dividing the total length by the space each plant occupies, we get 111 feet / 2.5 feet/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't plant parts of plants, she can fit 44 plants.

Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

Finally, each plant costs <fact5>$6</fact5>, so Pat will spend 27 plants * <fact5>$6/plant</fact5> = $162 at the store.

The answer is {162}.

He also watched <fact4>3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact4>. How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: The question asks how much time John spent sightseeing, and provides the information that he spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>.  The other information about boating, swimming, and watching shows is irrelevant to determining the time spent sightseeing. Therefore, the amount of time spent sightseeing needs to be calculated based on the total time spent on vacation, which is not provided in the question.  However, if we are to assume that the 30% is the percentage that is not spent sightseeing (and therefore, that only the information given for the amount of sightseeing and the other activities is relevant to answering the question), the total amount of time spent on the vacation activities is not specified, and the question cannot be answered. However, if we are to assume that the percentages add up to 100%, then we know that 100%-40%=60% is not spent on sightseeing. We still do not know the total amount of time, so we cannot determine the amount of time spent sightseeing.  We need to know the total amount of time spent on vacation to calculate the time spent sightseeing.

Answer: Kim has a total of <fact1>3</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 8 clients.  Each client requires <fact6>2 bottles of bleach</fact6> at $<fact3>2</fact3> each and <fact7>1 pack of cloths</fact7> at $<fact4>5</fact4> each.  Therefore, the cost per client is (2 * $2) + $5 = $9.  For 8 clients, the total weekly expenses are 8 * $9 = $72.  Kim's <fact5>total weekly income</fact5> is $<fact5>92</fact5>.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day.

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is <fact2>smaller than 2 inches</fact2>. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up <fact4>45% of the chalk</fact4> by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer: The teacher started with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1>. On Monday, he used <fact4>45%</fact4> of the chalk, which is 5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches.  This leaves him with 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk.  The teacher recycles the chalk when it is <fact2>smaller than 2 inches</fact2>. He aims to use only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3> after Monday.

Let's calculate how much chalk remains after each day, using the 20% usage rate:

* **Day 1 (Tuesday):** 2.75 inches * 0.20 = 0.55 inches used. Remaining chalk: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches.
* **Day 2 (Wednesday):** 2.2 inches * 0.20 = 0.44 inches used. Remaining chalk: 2.2 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches.
* **Day 3 (Thursday):** 1.76 inches * 0.20 = 0.352 inches used. Remaining chalk: 1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 inches.

Since the remaining chalk (1.408 inches) is already <fact2>smaller than 2 inches</fact2> after Wednesday, the teacher only has **2** more days (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he needs to recycle the chalk.  Therefore, the answer is {2}.

How much will it cost to fill the pool?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is <fact1>14 feet wide</fact1>, <fact2>25 feet long</fact2>, and <fact3>4 feet deep</fact3>. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by <fact4>5.9</fact4> to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is <fact5>$0.10 per gallon</fact5>. How much will it cost to fill the pool?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.  The volume is found by multiplying the width, length, and depth: <fact1>14 feet</fact1> * <fact2>25 feet</fact2> * <fact3>4 feet</fact3> = 1400 cubic feet.  The pool company said to multiply the volume in cubic feet by <fact4>5.9</fact4> to get the number of gallons: 1400 cubic feet * <fact4>5.9</fact4> = 8260 gallons.  Finally, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 8260 gallons * <fact5>$0.10/gallon</fact5> = $826. Therefore, it will cost $826 to fill the pool.

17,"Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","Reformatted Question: Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in <fact1>15 minutes</fact1>. They decide to do it on a <fact2>football field that is 100 yards long</fact2>. <fact3>Kelly runs back and forth once</fact3>, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the <fact4>40-yard line and back</fact4>. She does this <fact5>34 times</fact5>. <fact6>Blake runs back and forth 15 times</fact6>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Answer: First, let's calculate how far Kelly ran.  She ran back and forth once across the entire <fact2>100-yard field</fact2>, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she ran to the <fact4>40-yard line and back</fact4> <fact5>34 times</fact5>, covering a distance of 34 * (40 * 2) = 2720 yards.  In total, Kelly ran 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Next, let's calculate how far Blake ran. He ran back and forth <fact6>15 times</fact6> across the <fact2>100-yard field</fact2>, for a total distance of 15 * (100 * 2) = 3000 yards.

Comparing their distances, we see that Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards.  Therefore, Blake ran farther. The difference is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.  Blake ran 80 yards farther than Kelly.

Her husband eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>. The bag has <fact3>36 cookies</fact3> and she puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>. Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. How many cookies does Jenny eat?

Answer:  First, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week: <fact2>1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week</fact2>.  Next, let's find out how many cookies go into her son's lunchbox each week: <fact4>4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week</fact4>.  The total number of cookies consumed by her husband and son is 7 + 20 = 27 cookies. Since the bag contains <fact3>36 cookies</fact3>, and 27 were eaten by her husband and son, the number of cookies remaining for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted Question: A gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1> and cost <fact2>$12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The <fact3>north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The <fact4>east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls.  The north and south walls have an area of <fact3>10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet each</fact3>. Since there are two of these walls, their combined area is 80 square feet/wall * 2 walls = 160 square feet. The east and west walls have an area of <fact4>5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet each</fact4>.  Since there are two of these walls, their combined area is 40 square feet/wall * 2 walls = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Next, we determine how many gallons of paint are needed.  Since one gallon covers <fact1>20 square feet</fact1>, the number of gallons required is 240 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each gallon costs <fact2>$12</fact2>, so the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.  Therefore, it will cost Tony $144 to paint the room.

The answer is {144}.

20,"On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","Reformatted Question: On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. <fact2>24 guests elected an early checkout</fact2> and <fact3>15 elected for a late checkout</fact3>. <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner was served</fact4>. In the afternoon <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>. How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?

Answer:  The question asks for the number of guests *after* dinner. Let's break it down step-by-step, focusing only on the information relevant to the time *after* dinner:

1. **Starting Point:** The hotel begins with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>.

2. **Early Checkouts:** <fact2>24 guests checked out early</fact2>, meaning they left *before* dinner.  This doesn't affect the number of guests after dinner.

3. **Late Checkouts:** <fact3>15 guests checked out late</fact3>.  These guests were still present *during* dinner, and their departure happens *after* dinner.

4. **Afternoon Check-ins:** The number of afternoon check-ins (<fact5>twice as many as late checkouts</fact5>) is 15 * 2 = 30 guests.  These guests also arrive *before* dinner.

5. **Post-Dinner Check-ins:** Finally, <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner</fact4>.

To calculate the total number of guests *after* dinner:

* Start with the initial number: 100 guests
* Subtract late checkouts: 100 - 15 = 85 guests
* Add post-dinner check-ins: 85 + 7 = 92 guests

Therefore, the hotel has 92 guests after dinner.  The information about early checkouts and afternoon check-ins is irrelevant to the number of guests *after* dinner.

The answer is {92}.

He only picked up <fact3>3 in total</fact3>. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?

Answer:  Starting with <fact1>10 marbles</fact1>, Brendan dropped <fact2>half</fact2>, leaving him with 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. He picked up 3 items in total, but one was a bead, not a marble.  Therefore, he picked up 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Adding the marbles he picked up to the number he had left after dropping the bag, Brendan ended up with 5 + 2 = 7 marbles.

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Reformatted Question: Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact1>30 lbs</fact1>. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn <fact2>3500 calories</fact2> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

Answer: First, we need to determine the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight.  From December 31st to July 19th, there are 200 days (approximately, we will ignore leap years).

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal of losing <fact1>30 lbs</fact1>. Since he needs to burn <fact2>3500 calories</fact2> per pound, the total calorie deficit required is 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105000 calories.

Finally, to find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.  Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.  The answer is {525}.

He usually sells <fact2>marigolds for $2.74 per pot</fact2>, <fact3>petunias for $1.87 per pot</fact3> and <fact4>begonias for $2.12 per pot</fact4>. If Artie sells <fact5>12 pots of marigolds</fact5>, <fact6>9 pots of petunias</fact6> and <fact7>17 pots of begonias</fact7>, how much will he make?

Answer: Since Artie is rounding all prices to the nearest dollar (<fact1>rounding all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact1>), the price of marigolds will be rounded up to $3 per pot (<fact2>marigolds for $2.74 per pot</fact2>).  The price of petunias will be rounded up to $2 per pot (<fact3>petunias for $1.87 per pot</fact3>), and the price of begonias will be rounded down to $2 per pot (<fact4>begonias for $2.12 per pot</fact4>).

Therefore, the total earnings from marigolds will be $3/pot * <fact5>12 pots</fact5> = $36.  The total earnings from petunias will be $2/pot * <fact6>9 pots</fact6> = $18. The total earnings from begonias will be $2/pot * <fact7>17 pots</fact7> = $34.

Artie's total earnings will be $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?

Answer: To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to determine the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide by the number of days.

From the given information:

* Days one and two: <fact5>50 birds</fact5>
* Day three: <fact1>0 birds</fact1>
* Days four and five: <fact2>120 birds</fact2> (60 birds per day)
* Day six: <fact3>20 birds</fact3>
* Day seven: <fact4>90 birds</fact4>

Total birds seen: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Total number of days: 7 days

Average birds per day: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds/day

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds a day.  The answer is {40}.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, <fact6>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact6>. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?

Answer: In the first 30 seconds, <fact4>20 kernels popped</fact4>.  In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, meaning 20 * 3 = 60 kernels popped.  The total number of kernels popped in the first minute is 20 + 60 = 80 kernels. This confirms that the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate (80/20 = 4) after 60 seconds as stated in <fact1>.

In the final <fact2>30 seconds</fact2>, the popping rate is half that of the previous 30 seconds, meaning 60 / 2 = 30 kernels popped.

After the pan is removed, <fact6>a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat</fact6>. This is 30 / 4 = 7.5 kernels. Since we can't have half a kernel, we round this down to 7.

A watermelon costs <fact5>three times what each pepper costs</fact5>. What's the total amount of money he will spend if <fact6>each pepper costs 15$</fact6>?

Answer: Since each pepper costs <fact6>15$</fact6>, a watermelon costs three times that amount, which is 3 * <fact6>15$</fact6> = <fact5>45$</fact5>.  An orange costs <fact1>5$ less than a watermelon</fact1>, meaning an orange costs <fact5>45$</fact5> - <fact1>5$</fact1> = <fact1>40$</fact1>.

The total cost of watermelons will be <fact2>4 watermelons</fact2> * <fact5>45$/watermelon</fact5> = 180$.
The total cost of peppers will be <fact3>20 peppers</fact3> * <fact6>15$/pepper</fact6> = 300$.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys <fact1>two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes</fact1> for the whole stable. He buys <fact2>twenty 65-pound sacks of oats</fact2>. He buys <fact3>forty-two 75-pound bales of hay</fact3>. He buys <fact4>four 12-pound bags of carrots</fact4>.  <fact5>His farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</fact5>. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Sugar cubes:** <fact1>2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds</fact1>
* **Oats:** <fact2>20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds</fact2>
* **Hay:** <fact3>42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds</fact3>
* **Carrots:** <fact4>4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds</fact4>

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 2 pounds + 1300 pounds + 3150 pounds + 48 pounds = 4500 pounds.

Since <fact5>his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</fact5>, the farmer needs 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips to transport all the feed.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?,"Reformatted Question: Carl's favorite food is cheese. He ate a <fact1>sandwich every day this week for lunch</fact1> and used <fact2>2 slices of cheese on each sandwich</fact2>. He made a <fact3>big dish of macaroni and cheese</fact3> to last him several dinners for the week and used <fact4>8 slices of cheese in it</fact4>. He ate <fact5>cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week</fact5> using <fact6>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</fact6>. How many slices of cheese did he use?

Answer:  Since there are 7 days in a week and Carl used <fact2>2 slices of cheese per sandwich</fact2> for his <fact1>daily lunch sandwich</fact1>, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices of cheese on sandwiches.  He also used <fact4>8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese</fact4>.  For breakfast, he used <fact6>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</fact6>, meaning he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  Over <fact5>3 days</fact5>, this amounts to 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices of cheese on omelets. In total, Carl used 14 + 8 + 9 = 31 slices of cheese.  Therefore, the answer is {31}.

36,"Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the first race, he lost $5. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","Reformatted Question: Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the <fact1>second race</fact1>, he won <fact2>$1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact2>. On the <fact3>first race</fact3>, he lost <fact4>$5</fact4>. On the <fact5>third race</fact5>, he lost <fact6>1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact6>. How much did he lose on average that day?

Answer:  First, let's determine the dad's winnings in the second race.  He lost <fact4>$5</fact4> in the <fact3>first race</fact3>, so twice that amount is 2 * $5 = $10. Since he won <fact2>$1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact2>, his winnings in the <fact1>second race</fact1> were $10 + $1 = $11.

Next, let's calculate his losses in the <fact5>third race</fact5>. He lost <fact6>1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact6>, so his losses were 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now let's calculate his total winnings and losses for the day. He won $11 but lost $5 and $16.50.  His total losses are $5 + $16.50 = $21.50, and his total winnings are $11.  Therefore, his net loss for the day is $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

Since there were three races, his average loss per race is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.  Therefore, he lost an average of $3.50 per race that day.

The answer is {3.50}

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"Reformatted Question: A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his <fact1>3 friends</fact1>. Jack can play a game with <fact2>1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact2>. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play <fact3>half as long</fact3>. They play for <fact4>4 hours</fact4>. One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact5>1.5 times as long</fact5>. How much money is used?

Answer: Let's first calculate how many minutes each person plays, since the game cost is based on time.  The total playtime is <fact4>4 hours</fact4> * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Jack plays for 240 minutes, at a rate of <fact2>20 minutes per quarter</fact2>. This means he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

Two friends play <fact3>half as long</fact3> as Jack, meaning they each play 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes. At a rate of <fact2>20 minutes per quarter</fact2>, each uses 120 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 6 quarters.  Since there are two of them, they use a total of 6 quarters * 2 = 12 quarters.

One friend plays <fact5>1.5 times as long</fact5> as Jack, so he plays 240 minutes * 1.5 = 360 minutes.  At a rate of <fact2>20 minutes per quarter</fact2>, he uses 360 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 18 quarters.

In total, the group uses 12 quarters (Jack) + 12 quarters (two friends) + 18 quarters (one friend) = 42 quarters.  Therefore, the total cost is 42 quarters.  Since a quarter is $0.25, the total money used is 42 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $10.50.

How much does replacing the movies cost if a <fact6>normal movie costs $10</fact6>?

Answer:

First, let's determine the number of movies in series.  Since <fact4>a third of the movies are in series</fact4>, there are (1/3) * <fact1>600 movies</fact1> = 200 movies in series.

This leaves 600 - 200 = 400 movies that are not in series.

Of these 400 movies, <fact2>40% are older movies</fact2>, so there are 0.40 * 400 = 160 older movies.  The remaining 400 - 160 = 240 movies are normal movies.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $800.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 * <fact6>$10</fact6> = $2400.

The cost of the movies in series is 200 * (<fact6>$10</fact6> - <fact5>$6</fact5>) = 200 * $4 = $800.

Therefore, the total cost of replacing the movies is $800 + $2400 + $800 = $4000.

The answer is {4000}.

On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled <fact1>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact1> with water, and Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4 as much water as Wanda</fact2> pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact3>, while Ms. B only pumped <fact4>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact4>. A tank has a capacity of <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5>. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

Answer:
First, let's determine how much water Wanda pumped on the first day.  Wanda filled <fact1>1/4 of the tank</fact1>, which is (1/4) * <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> = 4500 gallons.

Next, let's find out how much water Ms. B pumped on the first day. Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4 as much water as Wanda</fact2>, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

Now let's calculate Wanda's contribution on the second day. Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day</fact3>, which was 4500 gallons.  Therefore, she pumped (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons on the second day.

Ms. B's contribution on the second day was <fact4>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact4>, which was 3375 gallons. So she pumped (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

In total, Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons over the two days, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.

Together they pumped 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.

Finally, to find out how many gallons are remaining, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity: <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

Therefore, 6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.  The answer is {6000}.

He's already put down a <fact6>deposit of $600</fact6>. He makes <fact7>$15 per hour at work</fact7>. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Answer: The total cost of the two implants is <fact1>2 implants</fact1> * <fact2>$2000 per implant</fact2> = $4000.  Since he wants a porcelain crown for <fact4>one of the implants</fact4>, the additional cost for crowns will be <fact3>$500</fact3>. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.  Considering his <fact6>deposit of $600</fact6>, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Boris produces <fact4>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact4>. How much does he produce the fourth week?

Answer:  The question asks for Boris's chocolate production in the fourth week. We know from <fact1> ""He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month"" </fact1> that his total monthly production is 50,000 bars.  We are given that he produces <fact4> 8,000 bars in the first week</fact4>. In the second week, <fact2> he produces half as much as the first week</fact2>, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, <fact3> he produces three times as much as the first week</fact3>, meaning he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars. To find the fourth week's production, we subtract the production from the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 8,000 - 4,000 - 24,000 = 14,000 bars. Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","Reformatted Question: Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park <fact1>when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet</fact1>. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. <fact2>While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour</fact2>. <fact3>In the end, the charge remaining was 28%</fact3>. <fact4>5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours</fact4>. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer:  Let's work backward from the final charge.

* **Step 1: Account for the final 3-hour drain:** After charging her friends' phones, Maria's power bank lost 7% of its capacity every hour for 3 hours.  This means it lost a total of 7% * 3 hours = 21%.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge before the final drain:** Before this 21% loss, the power bank had 28% + 21% = 49% charge remaining. <fact3>This is the charge remaining after using the power bank at the park</fact3>.

* **Step 3: Account for the park usage:**  At the park, <fact2>the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour while charging her friends' phones</fact2>. This loss occurred over an unknown number of hours (let's call this 'x' hours). The total percentage lost at the park is 9x%.

* **Step 4: Determine the initial charge at the park:**  The charge remaining after the park usage (49%) must be equal to the percentage of the initial park charge minus the percentage lost during park usage (9x%).  We can represent this as:

Initial charge (%) - 9x% = 49%

We do not know the value of 'x' from the provided information. However, we can still work out what the charge was before Maria left for the park.  To find the charge at the park, we need to calculate the charge that was lost while charging her friends' phones.  Since we already know that the final charge was 28%, we know that the power bank lost 100% - 28% = 72%. So, using this information we can calculate what percentage of charge was remaining before Maria left the park.


* **Step 5: Solve the equation:**  Since the power bank lost 21% in the final 3 hours <fact4>5 hours after charging</fact4>, we can work backwards to understand what the percentage lost was.  The power bank had lost a combined 72% - 21% = 51% of charge. Using the equation from Step 4 to calculate the original charge:

   Original Charge (%) - 51% = 28%

   Original Charge (%) = 28% + 51% = 79%


Therefore, the power bank had approximately 79% charge when Maria left to go to the park.  The exact percentage at the park is not calculable without knowing exactly how many hours Maria spent charging friends' phones. <fact1>The question states that it was not fully charged before she left</fact1>, meaning the 79% figure is the charge remaining after charging, not the initial charge of the power bank.

She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","Reformatted Question: Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking <fact1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</fact1>.  She then picks <fact2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</fact2>.  She then adds another <fact3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</fact3>.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops <fact4>1 of each</fact4> and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks <fact5>6 flowers with 7 petals each</fact5>. She also drops <fact6>1 of these flowers</fact6>.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?

Answer: First, let's calculate the petals from the flowers she picked initially before any were dropped.  She picked <fact1>3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals</fact1> from the first batch. Then, she picked <fact2>4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals</fact2> from the second batch.  Next, she picked <fact3>5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals</fact3> from the third batch.  Then, she picked <fact5>6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals</fact5> from the last batch.


Now let's account for the dropped flowers. She dropped <fact4>1 flower from each of the first three batches</fact4>, losing 15 - 5 = 10, 24 - 6 = 18, and 20 - 4 = 16 petals respectively. She also dropped <fact6>1 flower from the last batch</fact6>, losing 42 - 7 = 35 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals remaining after dropping the flowers is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 85 petals.  There were initially 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.  After dropping flowers she had 101 - 22 = 79 petals.


The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 79. The answer is {79}.

52,"A charity group decides to do a yard sale.  10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each.  They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table.  They also have 10 boxes of stuff already.  If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?","Reformatted Question: A charity group decides to do a yard sale. <fact1>10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each</fact1>. They can fit <fact2>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact2>. They also have <fact3>10 boxes of stuff already</fact3>. If they already own <fact4>15 tables</fact4>, how many new tables do they need?

Answer: The charity group receives <fact1>10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes</fact1> from donations.  Adding their existing <fact3>10 boxes</fact3>, they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff.  Since each table holds <fact2>2 boxes</fact2>, they need 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.  They already have <fact4>15 tables</fact4>, so they need 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables.  The answer is {15}.

53,"Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact1>. <fact2>Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. How many did each person get?

Answer:  From <fact2>Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>, we know Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Since <fact1>Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact1>, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Together they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

Dividing the seashells equally among the three, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Answer: In the first 6 hours, <fact1>30 bees left the hive</fact1>. In the second 6 hours, <fact2>1/2 * 30 = 15 bees returned</fact2>.  This means that 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours had not yet returned. In the third 6 hours, <fact4>two times as many bees as left in the first 6 hours left the hive</fact4>, meaning 2 * 30 = 60 bees left.  <fact3>In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned, returned to the hive</fact3>. This includes the 15 bees from the first 6 hours and the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours. Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 15 + 60 = 75 bees returned to the hive. The answer is {75}.

55,"Buford writes many checks every year.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?","Reformatted Question: Buford writes many checks every year.  He also writes a <fact1>check every month for the gas bill</fact1>.

How many checks does Buford write per year?

Answer: Let's break down the number of checks Buford writes per year based on the provided information:

* **Gas bill:** He writes one check per month (<fact1>check every month for the gas bill</fact1>), so that's 12 checks per year (12 months).
* **Pest and lawn service:** He writes a check quarterly (<fact2>quarterly</fact2>), meaning 4 times per year (4 quarters).  Therefore that's 4 checks a year (<fact3>check to the pest and lawn service</fact3>).
* **Electric bill:**  He pays this once per month (<fact4>Once per month</fact4>), resulting in 12 checks per year (<fact5>check to pay the electric bill</fact5>).
* **Church:** He writes two checks per month (<fact6>Twice per month</fact6>), leading to 24 checks per year (2 checks/month * 12 months) (<fact7>check to the church</fact7>).

To find the total number of checks, we add up the checks from each source: 12 + 4 + 12 + 24 = 52 checks. Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.  The answer is {52}.

56,"Mr. Tan paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Tan paid transfer fees that amount to <fact1>3% of the selling price</fact1> and also paid a <fact2>brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price</fact2>. Mr. Tan sold his house for <fact3>$400,000</fact3>. If he also paid <fact4>$250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house</fact4>, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?

Answer: First, let's calculate the transfer fees:  <fact1>3% of $400,000</fact1> is (3/100) * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: <fact2>5% of $400,000</fact2> is (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Mr. Tan received <fact3>$400,000</fact3> from the sale of his house, but he also paid <fact4>$250,000 to cover the remaining loan</fact4> and $32,000 in fees.  Therefore, his net proceeds are $400,000 - $250,000 - $32,000 = $118,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

57,"Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","Reformatted Question: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. <fact1>Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</fact1>. And <fact2>Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact2>. When Tobias howls, <fact3>each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds</fact3>. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Answer:  Let's denote the length of time Tobias howls as 'T'.  From <fact1>Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</fact1>, we know Chikote howls for 2T.  According to <fact2>Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact2>, Igneous howls for T + 2T = 3T.

Since <fact3>each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds</fact3> for Tobias,  T = 20 seconds.

Therefore:

* Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* Chikote howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.
* Igneous howls for 3 * 20 seconds = 60 seconds.

The combined howling time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.
The answer is {2}.

Assuming that <fact5>sales tax is included</fact5>, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: The shirt costs $<fact2>25</fact2>, and there's a <fact3>30% discount</fact3>.  The discount amount is 0.30 * $<fact2>25</fact2> = $<fact2>7.50</fact2>.  So the shirt's final price is $<fact2>25</fact2> - $<fact2>7.50</fact2> = $<fact2>17.50</fact2>.

The shorts cost $<fact4>35</fact4>.

The total cost of the outfit is $<fact2>17.50</fact2> + $<fact4>35</fact4> = $<fact4>52.50</fact4>.

Joe started with $<fact1>50</fact1>, and the outfit costs $<fact4>52.50</fact4>.  Since $<fact4>52.50</fact4> is more than $<fact1>50</fact1>, Joe will not have enough money to buy the outfit.

Answer:  On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, for a total cost of 20 * $20 = $400.  With her <fact1>$2 voucher</fact1>, her final price was $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at <fact3>$30 each</fact3>, for a total pre-discount cost of 20 * $30 = $600.  She received a <fact4>10% discount</fact4>, so the discount amount was $600 * 0.10 = $60.  Therefore, her final price was $600 - $60 = $540.

If she has <fact4>110 books</fact4>, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Answer:  Since each of the <fact3>two middle shelves can hold 10 books</fact3>, each bookcase has a middle shelf capacity of 2 * 10 = 20 books.  The <fact1>bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf</fact1>, meaning it holds 2 * 20 = 40 books. The <fact2>top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf</fact2>, so it holds 40 - 5 = 35 books. Therefore, each bookcase can hold a total of 20 + 40 + 35 = 95 books.

John makes himself a <fact4>6 egg omelet</fact4> with <fact5>2 oz of cheese</fact5> and an <fact6>equal amount of ham</fact6>. How many calories is the omelet?

Answer: The omelet contains <fact4>6 eggs</fact4>, each with <fact1>75 calories</fact1>, totaling 6 * 75 = 450 calories from eggs.  There are <fact5>2 oz of cheese</fact5> at <fact2>120 calories per ounce</fact2>, contributing 2 * 120 = 240 calories.  Since there's an <fact6>equal amount of ham</fact6>, there are also 2 oz of ham, and at <fact3>40 calories per ounce</fact3>, that's 2 * 40 = 80 calories.  Therefore, the total calories in the omelet are 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories. The answer is {770}.

She put both of these purchases on her credit card. The <fact2>returned item cost $15.00</fact2>. What is the new balance on her credit card?

Answer:  The initial charge on Sheila's credit card was <fact1>$85.00</fact1>.  She then returned an item costing <fact2>$15.00</fact2>, reducing her balance by that amount.  The new balance after the return is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, she bought a frying pan. The discount on the frying pan was <fact3>20% of $20.00</fact3>, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00.  Therefore, she paid $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan.

She also bought towels with a discount of <fact4>10% off $30.00</fact4>, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00.  So she paid $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the towels.

The cost of the new items is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Adding this to the balance after the return, her new credit card balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

If they are <fact4>there for 3 days</fact4> how much did the trip cost?

Answer: The normal daily hotel cost is <fact2>$1500</fact2>.  Because it's a busy weekend, the price is <fact1>20% more expensive</fact1>, meaning the increased cost per day is $1500 * 0.20 = $300.  Therefore, the daily cost during the busy weekend is $1500 + $300 = $1800. For <fact4>3 days</fact4>, the hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.  The total cost of plane tickets for two people is <fact3>$5000</fact3> * 2 = $10000.  The total cost of the trip is therefore $5400 (hotel) + $10000 (plane tickets) = $15400. The answer is {15400}.

He edits an <fact4>equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers</fact4>, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Answer:  Since Mark edits <fact1>1000 sentences each week</fact1> and edits an <fact4>equal number for each publisher</fact4>, he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays him <fact2>5 cents per sentence</fact2>, so he earns 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, meaning Publisher B pays 5 cents/sentence * 2 = 10 cents/sentence.  Therefore, he earns 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

The <fact5>go-karts cost $10 a ride</fact5>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer:  Morgan's total budget is <fact1>$90</fact1>.  The cost of go-karts is <fact5>$10 per ride</fact5> and she wants to ride <fact5>twice</fact5>, so that's 2 * <fact5>$10</fact5> = $20. She also wants <fact4>$5 in arcade tokens</fact4>.  The mini-golf costs <fact2>$5 per round</fact2>. This means that the cost for her and her friends for mini-golf will be 5*(number of friends + 1), since it's 5 dollars per person and she's inviting friends.  Therefore, the total cost of the party is $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) + 5*(number of friends +1). This total cannot exceed her budget of <fact1>$90</fact1>.

Let's represent the number of friends as 'x'.  The equation representing the total cost is:

20 + 5 + 5(x + 1) ≤ 90

Simplifying:

25 + 5x + 5 ≤ 90
30 + 5x ≤ 90
5x ≤ 60
x ≤ 12

Therefore, Morgan can invite a maximum of 12 friends.
The answer is {12}.

If each pizza costs <fact5>$15</fact5>, how many dollars will Maddy spend?

Answer: First, we need to determine the total number of people Maddy needs to feed. There are <fact1>12 team members</fact1> and <fact2>3 coaches</fact2>, for a total of 12 + 3 = 15 people.  Each of the <fact1>12 team members</fact1> brings <fact3>2 guests</fact3>, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  Adding the guests to the team members and coaches, we get a total of 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy.  Each pizza serves <fact4>3 people</fact4>, so Maddy will need 39 people / <fact4>3 people per pizza</fact4> = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * <fact5>$15 per pizza</fact5> = $195.

Therefore, the total cost of the house is the <fact1>selling price</fact1> plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.  Comparing this to Mrs. Cruz's <fact4>budget of $400,000</fact4>, the house costs $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 more than her budget.  The answer is {9500}.

Last week, on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.","Reformatted Question: A blog article takes an average of <fact1>4 hours</fact1> to research and write. Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. Last week, on Wednesday, she wrote <fact2>twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact2>. She wrote <fact3>5 articles on Monday</fact3> and <fact4>2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact4>. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.

Answer:  First, we need to determine how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.  She wrote <fact3>5 articles on Monday</fact3>, and on Tuesday she wrote 2/5 more, meaning she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 7 articles on Tuesday.

Next, we find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday.  According to <fact2>the question</fact2>, she wrote twice the number of articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

In total, over the three days, Meredith wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Finally, we calculate the total time spent writing. Each article takes <fact1>4 hours</fact1> to write, so she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing articles in those three days.

70,"Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?","Reformatted Question: Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. <fact1>Adam has collected 50 points</fact1>. <fact2>Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, who has <fact3>30 points less than Betty</fact3>. <fact4>Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more</fact4>. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is <fact5>400 points</fact5>?

Answer: First, let's find out how many points Betty has.  Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, who has <fact1>50 points</fact1>.  This means Betty has 50 + (30/100) * 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Next, we need to determine Tom's points.  Tom has <fact3>30 points less than Betty</fact3>, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Now, let's calculate Martha's points. <fact2>Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, who has 35 points. Therefore, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

To find the total points collected by the class, we add up the points of all students: Adam (50) + Martha (105) + Betty (65) + Tom (35) = 255 points.

Finally, to find out how many points the class is missing to reach the <fact5>minimum threshold of 400 points</fact5>, we subtract the total points collected from the required points: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Therefore, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

Bob started with <fact3>7 fish in his pond</fact3>. <fact4>3 were orange</fact4>, and <fact5>4 were white</fact5>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Answer:  Bob started with <fact5>4 white fish</fact5> and <fact4>3 orange fish</fact4> (<fact3>7 fish in total</fact3>). He bought <fact1>17 fish</fact1> in total. Let's say he bought 'x' white fish. This means he bought 17 - x orange fish.

After adding the new fish, Bob has 4 + x white fish and 3 + (17 - x) orange fish.  According to the problem, he now has <fact2>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact2>.  Therefore:

2 * (4 + x) = 3 + (17 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

8 + 2x = 20 - x
3x = 12
x = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer: The total number of toys needed is <fact1>400 toys</fact1>.  The number of toys still needed at the end of the shift is <fact4>20 toys</fact4>. Therefore, the number of toys produced during the <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3> is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The <fact5>two workers producing 6 toys an hour</fact5> together produce 6 toys/hour * 2 workers = 12 toys/hour. Over a <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, they produce 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

The <fact6>two workers producing 4 toys an hour</fact6> together produce 4 toys/hour * 2 workers = 8 toys/hour. Over a <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, they produce 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The remaining toys were produced by the fifth worker: 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

Since they worked a <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, the fifth worker produced 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour. The answer is {18}.

The jar has a <fact4>square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall</fact4>. The <fact5>true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</fact5>. How far off was his guess?

Answer: First, let's calculate the volume of the jar.  The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches,  as stated in <fact4>The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall</fact4>.  Therefore, the volume is 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we need to account for the packing efficiency.  The problem states that <fact2>they get about 80% efficiency in packing</fact2>. This means only 80% of the jar's volume is actually filled with jelly beans.  So, the volume occupied by jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, let's find the total number of jelly beans. Each jelly bean is <fact1>a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches</fact1>, therefore the total number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim estimates that <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>, so his guess for the number of red jelly beans is 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The room will warm up at <fact6>2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running</fact6>. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the cooling effect while the air conditioner was on low.  The air conditioner ran on low for <fact1>3 hours</fact1> at a rate of <fact4>2 degrees per hour</fact4>, resulting in a temperature decrease of 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the cooling effect while the air conditioner was on high.  The air conditioner ran on high for <fact2>4 hours</fact2> at a rate of <fact5>3 degrees per hour</fact5>, resulting in a temperature decrease of 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect from the air conditioner is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

Finally, let's calculate the warming effect while the air conditioner was off. The air conditioner was off for <fact3>2 hours</fact3>, and the room warmed up at a rate of <fact6>2 degrees per hour</fact6>, resulting in a temperature increase of 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

The third friend's guess was 25% more than the first friend's guess, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 100 jelly beans. To find the average guess, we sum the three guesses (80 + 60 + 100 = 240) and divide by the number of friends (3): 240 / 3 = 80.  Their average guess is 80 jelly beans.

How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year if there are 4 weeks in a month?","Reformatted Question: Every month, Madeline has to buy <fact1>food</fact1>, <fact2>treats</fact2>, and <fact3>medicine</fact3> for her dog. <fact2>Treats cost $20 per month</fact2>. <fact3>Medicine costs $100 per month</fact3>. <fact1>Food costs $25 per week</fact1>. How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year if there are <fact4>4 weeks in a month</fact4>?

Answer: Madeline's monthly expenses for her dog include:
* **Treats:** $<fact2>20</fact2>
* **Medicine:** $<fact3>100</fact3>
* **Food:** $<fact1>25</fact1>/week * <fact4>4 weeks/month</fact4> = $<fact1>100</fact1>/month

On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","Reformatted Question: Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Wednesday, he watched <fact1>a few episodes of a 30-minute show</fact1>. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched <fact2>a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact2>. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched <fact3>a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched <fact4>two 1-hour episodes</fact4>. If he watched <fact5>7 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact1>30-minute episodes</fact1> did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: Let's calculate Frankie's total TV time from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

* **Monday and Tuesday:** He watched 2 hours of TV (fact2: 1 hour/night * 2 nights).
* **Thursday:** He watched 1.5 hours of TV (fact3: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours).
* **Friday:** He watched 2 hours of TV (fact4: 2 hours * 1 hour/episode).

This adds up to 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.  Since he watched 7 hours of TV in all (fact5), the remaining time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes long (fact1), and there are two 30-minute periods in one hour, he watched 1.5 hours * 2 episodes/hour = 3 episodes on Wednesday.  Therefore, Frankie watched 3, 30-minute episodes on Wednesday. The answer is {3}.

How many 5 dollar bills does he have?","Reformatted Question: Thomas <fact1>withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills</fact1> from the bank account.

He then <fact4>converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills</fact4>. He <fact5>lost 10 bills while getting home</fact5>. How many 5 dollar bills does he have?

Answer:  First, we need to determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew.  From <fact1>“withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills”</fact1>, we calculate that he had 1000/20 = 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, consider <fact5>""He lost 10 bills while getting home""</fact5>. This happened *before* he paid any bills, so he started with 50 - 10 = 40 bills after arriving home.

According to <fact2>“uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill”</fact2>, he used 40/2 = 20 bills, leaving him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Then, <fact3>“triples his money”</fact3> means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 twenty-dollar bills.

The total amount of money he has is 60 * $20 = $1200.  

Finally, <fact4>“converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills”</fact4> means we divide his total money by the value of each 5 dollar bill.  Therefore, he has $1200 / $5 = 240 five-dollar bills.

The answer is {240}.

He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4> and he also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total miles John travels per day.  His work is <fact3>30 miles away</fact3>, and he goes there and back, so he travels 30 * 2 = 60 miles daily.

Next, let's find the total miles per week: He works <fact1>5 days a week</fact1>, so he travels 60 miles/day * <fact1>5 days/week</fact1> = 300 miles per week.

Now, let's calculate the total miles per year: He works for <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2>, so he travels 300 miles/week * <fact2>50 weeks/year</fact2> = 15000 miles per year.

The cost per mile is <fact4>$2</fact4>, so the cost for miles driven yearly is 15000 miles * <fact4>$2/mile</fact4> = $30000.

Finally, we need to add the driver's bonus:  There are 12 months in a year, and the bonus is <fact5>$150 per month</fact5>, making the yearly bonus 12 months * <fact5>$150/month</fact5> = $1800.

The answer is {31800}.

He decides to go with the option of adding on <fact5>70 pesos for every additional hour</fact5> after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for <fact4>24 hours</fact4>. How much money would Cameron save?

Answer:  Let's first calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at <fact1>5 pm</fact1> and leaves at <fact2>10 am the next morning</fact2>. This is a total of 17 hours.

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay option (<fact4>1600 pesos</fact4>), he would pay the full amount regardless of his actual stay duration.

However, if he opts for the 12-hour stay option (<fact3>1000 pesos</fact3>) and adds extra hours, his stay exceeds the initial 12 hours by 17 - 12 = 5 hours.  Therefore, the additional cost would be 5 hours * <fact5>70 pesos/hour</fact5> = 350 pesos.  His total cost using this method would be <fact3>1000 pesos</fact3> + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

The difference between the two options represents Cameron's savings: <fact4>1600 pesos</fact4> - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos. The answer is {250}.

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Reformatted Question: Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1>, there's a <fact2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact2>. There's a <fact3>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</fact3>. Even if the <fact4>whole class doesn't get an extension</fact4>, there's a <fact5>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact5>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer:  Let's break down the chances of Marcus *not* having to turn in his homework:

* **Scenario 1: Normal teacher gives extension:** There's a <fact1>40% chance</fact1> the normal teacher will give an extension.

* **Scenario 2: Substitute teacher:** There's a <fact3>50% chance</fact3> of a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.

* **Scenario 3: Normal teacher, no extension, but dog-ate-homework:**  There's a <fact1>60%</fact1> chance the normal teacher *won't* give an extension (100% - <fact2>40%</fact2>).  Within that 60% chance, there's a <fact5>20% chance</fact5> the dog-ate-homework excuse works.  So, the probability of this scenario is 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12 or 12%.

To find the total probability of Marcus *not* having to turn in his homework, we add the probabilities of these mutually exclusive scenarios:  0.4 (Scenario 1) + 0.5 (Scenario 2) + 0.12 (Scenario 3) = 1.02.  Note that this exceeds 100% due to a slight error in wording of probabilities. Let's assume the 20% chance of the dog-ate-homework excuse is only applicable if the normal teacher does *not* give an extension.


The probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 100% minus the probability of not having to turn it in.  Let's recalculate this using the correct probabilities:

Probability of normal teacher and no extension: (1 - 0.4) = 0.6
Probability of dog eating homework given no extension: 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12
Probability of not turning in homework: 0.4 + 0.5 + 0.12 = 1.02

Since the total probability exceeds 1, there's an issue with the problem statement's probabilities. Let's assume that the probabilities are independent.
Then the probability of needing to turn in homework is 
(1 - 0.4)(1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.2) = 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Therefore, there is a 24% chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework. The answer is {24}.

112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted Question: Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. <fact1>Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>. <fact2>A small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. <fact3>A large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>. Lorraine starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact6>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact6> and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <fact7>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact7>. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: Let's break down Lorraine's trades step-by-step:

**Large Sticker Trades:**

* Lorraine starts with <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>.
* She trades <fact6>50%</fact6> of them, which is 40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers.  According to <fact1>Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>, trading 20 large stickers gets her 20 large buttons.
* She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
* She trades these 20 large stickers for small buttons.  Again, using <fact1>Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>, each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

**Small Sticker Trades:**

* Lorraine starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4>.
* She trades <fact7>90%</fact7> of them for large buttons, which is 30 * 0.9 = 27 small stickers. Since <fact2>A small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>, and <fact3>A large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>, trading 27 small stickers gets her 27/3 = 9 large buttons.
* She has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.  Since <fact2>A small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>, she has 3 small buttons.

**Total Buttons:**

* From large sticker trades, Lorraine has 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons.
* From small sticker trades, she has 9 large buttons + 3 small buttons.
* In total, she has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

Therefore, Lorraine has a total of 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons by the end.  The question asks for the total number of buttons, however it doesn't specify to distinguish between large and small buttons.  Therefore, the number of buttons she has at the end is 29+63=92.

The answer is {92}.

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact5>20%</fact5> cost per frame. <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers and they will need to receive cords that are <fact7>$12</fact7> each. How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer:  The cost of the picture frames is <fact4>$20</fact4> per frame * <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> = $880.  The etching cost is 20% of $880, which is 0.20 * $880 = $176. The total cost of the frames and etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.  The cost of the pins is <fact3>$5</fact3> per pin * <fact2>2 seniors</fact2> = $10. The number of officers is <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> * (<fact6>1/4</fact6>) = 11 officers. The cost of the cords is <fact7>$12</fact7> per cord * 11 officers = $132.  Therefore, the total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames and etching, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198. The answer is {1198}.

He stopped being penpals with <fact3>2 of them</fact3>. They each send <fact4>2 letters a week</fact4> that are <fact5>5 pages long</fact5>. He responds in kind. How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Answer: After Mike stopped being pen pals with 2 people, he continued to exchange letters with <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact3>2</fact3> = <fact6>3 people</fact6>. Each of these <fact6>3 people</fact6> sends him <fact4>2 letters</fact4> a week, each letter containing <fact5>5 pages</fact5>.  Therefore, Mike receives 3 * <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact5>5</fact5> = 30 pages per week from his pen pals.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes <fact4>2 letters</fact4> * <fact5>5 pages/letter</fact5> * <fact6>3 people</fact6> = 30 pages per week.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Knowing that Mike writes a page every <fact1>6 minutes</fact1>, it takes him 60 pages * <fact1>6 minutes/page</fact1> = 360 minutes to write all his letters.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes/hour: 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing letters each week.  The answer is {6}.

How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.

* **Passion fruit cost:** <fact5>2 pounds</fact5> * <fact1>$6/pound</fact1> = $12
* **Jackfruit cost:** <fact6>1.5 pounds</fact6> * <fact2>$8/pound</fact2> = $12
* **Honey cost:** <fact7>2 pounds</fact7> * <fact3>$10/pound</fact3> = $20

The total cost of ingredients per jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Tim sells each jar for <fact4>$50</fact4>, so his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

Selling 10 jars, his total profit will be 10 jars * $6/jar = $60.

Therefore, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

Answer:  Mr. Jackson needs to give each of his <fact2>27 students</fact2> <fact3>2 glue sticks</fact3>.  This means he needs a total of 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.  Since glue sticks come in packs of <fact1>8</fact1>, we need to determine how many packs of 8 are required to get at least 54 glue sticks.  Dividing 54 by 8, we get 6 with a remainder of 6 (54 / 8 = 6.75).

The second class has <fact4>12 girls</fact4>. The school as a whole is <fact5>50% boys and 50% girls</fact5>. How many boys are in the third class?

Answer: Since there are <fact1>3 classes</fact1>, and each class has <fact2>20 students</fact2>, there are a total of 3 * <fact2>20</fact2> = 60 students in the school.  Given that the school is <fact5>50% boys and 50% girls</fact5>, there are 60/2 = 30 girls and 30 boys in total.

The first class has <fact3>15 girls</fact3>, so it has 20 - <fact3>15</fact3> = 5 boys.
The second class has <fact4>12 girls</fact4>, so it has 20 - <fact4>12</fact4> = 8 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is the total number of boys minus the boys in the first and second classes: 30 - 5 - 8 = 17 boys.

In total, 24 + 12 = 36 slices were eaten.  Since there were 5 pizzas * <fact6>12 slices/pizza</fact6> = 60 slices to begin with, there are 60 - 36 = 24 slices of pizza left.  The answer is {24}.

How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?","Reformatted Question: James buys a plane. He pays <fact1>$5000 a month to rent a hanger</fact1> to keep it in. He also spends <fact2>twice as much as that on fuel per month</fact2>. The <fact3>plane cost $150,000</fact3>. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?

Answer: The plane cost James <fact3>$150,000</fact3>.  He pays <fact1>$5000 per month</fact1> for the hanger, and <fact2>twice that amount</fact2>, or $10,000 per month, on fuel.  Therefore, his monthly costs are $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Over a year (12 months), his maintenance costs are $15,000/month * 12 months = $180,000. Adding the initial cost of the plane, his total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Therefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.

After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?","Reformatted Question: James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. <fact1>James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</fact1>, but <fact2>there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</fact2>. <fact3>After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</fact3> so he had to buy some more toys. <fact4>When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone</fact4> so he no longer needed those toys. <fact5>Each dog needs one toy</fact5>. How many toys in total does James need?

Answer:  Initially, James has <fact1>4 toys for 4 dogs</fact1>.  Then <fact2>8 more dogs arrive</fact2>, meaning he needs 4 + 8 = 12 toys. <fact3>The number of dogs doubles</fact3> after he buys the first set of toys. Since he already had 12 dogs, there are now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. Therefore, he needs 24 toys.  <fact4>Finally, 3 dogs leave</fact4>, reducing the number of required toys to 24 - 3 = 21.  <fact5>Each dog needs one toy</fact5>, so the total number of toys James needs is 21.

After <fact3>10 years</fact3> <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>. Every year he also <fact5>chops down 2 trees a year</fact5>. How many trees does he have left?

Answer: After 10 years, Tom would have planted an additional <fact1>10 trees/year</fact1> * <fact3>10 years</fact3> = 100 trees.  Adding this to his initial amount, he would have had <fact2>50 trees</fact2> + 100 trees = 150 trees. However, he also chopped down <fact5>2 trees/year</fact5> * <fact3>10 years</fact3> = 20 trees over the 10 years. So before any die, he would have 150 trees - 20 trees = 130 trees.  Then, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>, which is 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.  Therefore, he has 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees left. The answer is {91}.

How much does he make?","Reformatted Question: John cuts down a <fact1>80-foot tree</fact1>. He cuts it into <fact2>4-foot logs</fact2>. He sells planks for <fact3>$1.2 each</fact3>. He can make logs out of <fact4>80% of the tree</fact4>. From each of those logs, he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5>. How much does he make?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many logs John can make.  Since the tree is <fact1>80 feet</fact1> tall and he cuts <fact2>4-foot logs</fact2>, he would be able to make 80/4 = 20 logs if he used the entire tree. However, he can only use <fact4>80% of the tree</fact4>, so he can make 20 logs * 0.80 = 16 logs.

Next, we determine how many planks he makes.  Since he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5> from each log and he makes 16 logs, he makes 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, we calculate his earnings. Since he sells each plank for <fact3>$1.2</fact3>, he makes 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96.  The answer is {96}.

There would be <fact5>20 people</fact5> in total watching the game. How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>?

Answer: To serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>, Tyson needs <fact5>20 people</fact5> / <fact2>4 people per sandwich</fact2> = 5 sandwiches.  Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese (<fact1>muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>). Therefore, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * <fact3>$7.00 per pound</fact3> = $35.00. The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * <fact4>$3.00 per pound</fact4> = $15.00.  In total, Tyson would spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese. The answer is {50}.

133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"Reformatted Question: Cole hid <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds <fact3>twice as many as Lamar</fact3>. Charlie finds <fact4>2 less than Stacy</fact4>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Cole hid: 3 dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = <fact1>36 eggs</fact1>.

Next, let's figure out how many eggs Stacy found: Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 * <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> = <fact3>10 eggs</fact3>.

Now, let's determine how many eggs Charlie found: Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, meaning he found <fact3>10 eggs</fact3> - <fact4>2 eggs</fact4> = 8 eggs.

Then, let's find out how many eggs Mei found: Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 eggs / 2 = 4 eggs.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of eggs found: Lamar found 5 eggs, Stacy found 10 eggs, Charlie found 8 eggs, and Mei found 4 eggs.  In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs found: <fact1>36 eggs</fact1> - 27 eggs = 9 eggs.

The answer is {9}.

If he puts all of his <fact3>crayons</fact3> into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the <fact3>crayons</fact3> and the boxes, if each <fact4>box weighs 8 ounces</fact4>?

Answer: Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>, and each <fact1>crayon weighs 1 ounce</fact1>, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.  Since he separates them into groups of 8, he will need 200/8 = 25 boxes. Each <fact4>box weighs 8 ounces</fact4>, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.  Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.  Since each <fact2>pound is 16 ounces</fact2>, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds. The answer is {25}.

He also decided to buy himself a donut for <fact4>$2</fact4>. How much did everything cost?

Answer: Roger buys coffee for a week, and he uses <fact1>1 pound of coffee per day</fact1>.  Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee (7 days/week * 1 pound/day = 7 pounds). The normal price is <fact2>$5 per pound</fact2>, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more.  The increased cost is $5 * 0.20 = $1 per pound. Therefore, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42. He also bought a donut for <fact4>$2</fact4>. Therefore, the total cost of everything is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44. The answer is {44}.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Reformatted Question: Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. <fact1>Four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>. <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>. <fact3>Half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>. <fact4>Six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>. <fact5>Twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>. Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

Answer:  First, let's find the number of students needing small shirts.  We know from <fact5> that twice as many students need size small as extra small, and from <fact2> that 11 students need extra small shirts</fact2>. Therefore, there are 11 * 2 = 22 students who need small shirts.

Next, we can determine the number of students needing medium shirts. <fact1> states that four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>.  This means there are 22 - 4 = 18 students who need medium shirts.

Now let's figure out the number of students who need large shirts. According to <fact3>, half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>, so there are 18 / 2 = 9 students who need large shirts.

Finally, we can determine how many students need extra-large shirts. <fact4> tells us that six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>, meaning there are 9 + 6 = 15 students who need extra-large shirts.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add up the number of shirts needed for each size: 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) + 11 (extra-small) = 75 shirts.

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts. The answer is {75}.

How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him <fact10>$150 to spend at the movies</fact10>?

Answer: Let's calculate Colby's spending so far this month.  He's already seen 5 Friday/Saturday movies at $10 each, costing him 5 * $10 = $50. He's seen 8 weekday movies at $7 each, costing him 8 * $7 = $56.  His popcorn cost him 2 * $8 = $16, and his candy cost him 4 * $2 = $8. His total spending to date is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Tonight, he wants a popcorn and a box of candy, costing him $8 + $2 = $10.  This brings his total spending for the month (excluding additional movies) to $130 + $10 = $140.

He has $150 from his parents, so he has $150 - $140 = $10 left to spend on movies. Since it's Friday, each additional movie costs $10.  Therefore, he can see one more movie (1 * $10 = $10), using up his remaining money.

Therefore, Colby can see one more movie tonight.
The answer is {1}.

She uses the <fact6>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact6> and the <fact7>same amount of salt as sugar</fact7>. She makes enough to fill a <fact8>10-ounce jar</fact8> each time. She uses <fact9>twice as much oil as salt</fact9> and <fact10>twice as much salt as zest</fact10>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer: Let's use 'x' to represent the amount of citrus zest Tanya uses.  Because she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance (<fact6>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact6>), she also uses 'x' ounces of fragrance.  Since she uses twice as much salt as zest (<fact10>twice as much salt as zest</fact10>), she uses 2x ounces of salt.  Because she uses the same amount of salt as sugar (<fact7>same amount of salt as sugar</fact7>), she also uses 2x ounces of sugar. Finally, she uses twice as much oil as salt (<fact9>twice as much oil as salt</fact9>), meaning she uses 2 * (2x) = 4x ounces of oil.

The total amount of scrub is 10 ounces (<fact8>10-ounce jar</fact8>), so we can set up an equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combining like terms, we get:

10x = 10

Solving for x:

x = 1

Therefore, Tanya uses 4x = 4 * 1 = 4 ounces of oil. The answer is {4}.

Before its first stop, it had <fact4>20 people</fact4>. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.

Answer:
First, let's calculate the number of people who boarded the bus at the second station.  According to <fact3>the problem statement</fact3>, this was (3/4) * <fact2>40 people</fact2> = 30 people.

Next, let's find the total number of passengers after the second station.  Before the first stop, there were <fact4>20 people</fact4> on the bus. At the first stop, <fact2>40 people entered</fact2>, and at the second stop, <fact3>30 people entered</fact3>. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second station is 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people.

The problem states that the number of passengers doubled at the third station. This means that after the third station, the bus had 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Finally, to find the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of passengers after the third station from the bus's capacity: <fact1>200 people (capacity)</fact1> - 180 people = 20 people.

Therefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.

The fee to rent the theater is <fact5>$125 for a party of 20</fact5>, plus <fact6>$6 for each additional guest</fact6>. How much will the party cost?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of people invited. Kayla invited <fact1>25 classmates</fact1> + <fact2>7 girls from her dance class</fact2> + <fact3>13 family members</fact3> = 45 people.

145,"Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","Reformatted Question: Sasha has leftover lumber she decides to sell.  The price of lumber has increased by <fact1>50%</fact1> since she bought it. She has <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> that cost her <fact3>$10 each</fact3>. She also has <fact4>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> she bought for <fact5>$16 each</fact5>. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer: First, let's calculate Sasha's total cost for the lumber.  She spent <fact3>$10</fact3> per board for <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2>, so that's 10 * $10 = $100.  She also spent <fact5>$16</fact5> per board for <fact4>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4>, making that 5 * $16 = $80. Her total initial cost was $100 + $80 = $180.

Because the price of lumber has gone up by <fact1>50%</fact1>, she can now sell each board for 1.5 times the original cost.  Thus, her 2 x 4 x 10 boards are now worth $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and her 4 x 4 x 10 boards are now worth $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Therefore, she will earn (10 * $15) + (5 * $24) = $150 + $120 = $270 from selling all the boards.

Her profit is the selling price minus her initial cost, so her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.  Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90.

146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"Reformatted Question: Crista's plants need to be watered <fact1>every day</fact1>. <fact2>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact2>. She has <fact3>20 plants</fact3>. <fact4>4 of her plants need half of a cup of water</fact4>. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need <fact1>every day</fact1> for her plants?

Answer: Crista has a total of <fact3>20 plants</fact3>.  <fact2>8 plants</fact2> need 1 cup of water each, requiring 8 cups of water.  <fact4>4 plants</fact4> need 1/2 cup each, requiring 4 * (1/2) = 2 cups of water. The remaining number of plants is 20 - 8 - 4 = 8 plants. These 8 plants need 1/4 cup of water each, requiring 8 * (1/4) = 2 cups of water. Therefore, Crista needs a total of 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 cups of water <fact1>every day</fact1> for her plants. The answer is {12}.

148,"Caroline has 4 children. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. The first child is 6 feet tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","Reformatted Question: Caroline has <fact1>4 children</fact1>. The <fact2>second child is two inches taller than the first child</fact2>. The <fact3>first child is 6 feet tall</fact3>. The <fact4>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact4>. And the <fact5>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact5>. How tall is the fourth child, in inches?

Answer: First, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the <fact3>first child is 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall</fact3>.

Next, we find the height of the <fact2>second child, who is 2 inches taller than the first child</fact2>.  Therefore, the second child is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.

Then, we determine the height of the <fact4>third child, who is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact4>.  This means the third child is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

Finally, we calculate the height of the <fact5>fourth child, who is 3 inches taller than the third child</fact5>.  So, the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","Reformatted Question: Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: <fact1>MTB</fact1>, <fact2>BMX</fact2>, and <fact3>Trekking</fact3>. In one month, Marcel sold a total of <fact4>300 bikes</fact4> among the types listed. <fact5>Half of them were Trekking bikes</fact5>, and <fact6>15% were BMX bikes</fact6>. The rest of the sold bikes were <fact1>MTB</fact1> type. The price of one <fact1>MTB</fact1> is <fact7>$500</fact7>, <fact2>BMX</fact2> is half the price of an <fact1>MTB</fact1>, and a <fact3>Trekking bike</fact3> is <fact8>$450</fact8>. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Answer:  First, let's determine how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

* **Trekking bikes:** <fact5>Half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes</fact5>, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
* **BMX bikes:** <fact6>15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes</fact6>, so he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB bikes:** The remaining bikes were MTBs.  This is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now let's calculate the revenue from each type:

* **MTB revenue:** 105 bikes * <fact7>$500/bike</fact7> = $52,500
* **BMX revenue:** The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it's $500 / 2 = $250.  Therefore, the revenue from BMX bikes is 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* **Trekking revenue:** 150 bikes * <fact8>$450/bike</fact8> = $67,500

Finally, let's add up the revenue from all three types of bikes: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Therefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.  The answer is {131250}.

His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra <fact6>$10</fact6>. How much money does Dean have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought.  Since each toy car cost <fact2>$2</fact2> and he bought <fact4>6 toy cars</fact4>, the total cost of the cars is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact4>6</fact4> = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears. Each teddy bear cost <fact3>$1</fact3> and he bought <fact5>5 teddy bears</fact5>, so the total cost of the teddy bears is <fact3>1</fact3> * <fact5>5</fact5> = $5.

Therefore, the total amount Dean spent on toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean started with <fact1>$28</fact1> from his mother, spent $17, leaving him with $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gave him an extra <fact6>$10</fact6>, so he now has $11 + <fact6>10</fact6> = $21.

One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","Reformatted Question: A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. <fact1>One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges</fact1>. <fact2>Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece</fact2>. <fact3>One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much</fact3>. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?

Answer:  First, let's find the cost of a banana.  According to <fact3>, ""One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much,"" so a banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.00.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange. <fact2> states that ""Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece"". Therefore, an orange costs $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

Now we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate.  <fact1> tells us that ""One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges"".  So the cost is:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

The total price for the crate is $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.00.

The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released <fact7>half of the yellow balloons</fact7>. What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of balloons Sally had before encountering the tree.  She started with <fact3>25 red balloons</fact3>, <fact4>7 green balloons</fact4>, and <fact5>12 yellow balloons</fact5>, for a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons. Then, <fact6>40% of the red balloons burst</fact6>, which is 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons.  This leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons. Next, she <fact7>accidentally released half of the yellow balloons</fact7>, which is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons. So, before finding the balloons in the tree, Sally had 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Next, she found <fact1>8 blue balloons</fact1> and added <fact2>75% of them</fact2> to her existing balloons.  75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 balloons. Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her 28 balloons.

Finally, Sally carried into the school 28 + 6 = 34 balloons. The answer is {34}.

He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>6 periods in the day</fact1> for a normal student. Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>. He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of classes John attends per week.  A normal student has <fact1>6 periods a day</fact1>, and John takes an additional <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>, meaning he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day. Over <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, that's 8 classes/day * 5 days/week = 40 classes per week.

Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>, so his weekday class time is 40 minutes/class * 40 classes = 1600 minutes.

Now let's figure out his weekend study time.  First, find his total weekday minutes: 1600 minutes.  Then, calculate his total weekly minutes before weekend study: 1600 minutes. A week has 7 days so there are 7 * 24 * 60 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday. That’s (1/16) * 10080 minutes/week = 630 minutes per day for Saturday and Sunday, respectively.

His total weekly learning time is therefore 1600 minutes (weekday classes) + 630 minutes (Saturday) + 630 minutes (Sunday) = 2860 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes/hour: 2860 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 47.67 hours.  Therefore, John spends approximately 47.67 hours a week learning.

How many stamps did Max buy in all?

Answer:  Max bought <fact6>16 snowflake stamps</fact6>.  He bought <fact4>3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps</fact4>, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought <fact5>9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps</fact5>, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.  Therefore, in total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps. The answer is {45}.

If Brinley has scores of <fact3>89, 71, 92, 100 and 86</fact3> on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of <fact4>93</fact4>?

Answer:  Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.  As per <fact2>Mr. Bert's policy</fact2>, the lowest score, 71, will be dropped from the calculation of the average.  Therefore, the scores considered are 89, 92, 100, and 86. Let x represent the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

To achieve an average of <fact4>93</fact4> after dropping the lowest score, the sum of the remaining five scores must be 93 * 5 = 465.

The sum of Brinley's four highest scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Therefore, the equation to solve for x (the sixth test score) is:

367 + x = 465

Subtracting 367 from both sides, we find:

x = 465 - 367 = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

They had <fact10>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</fact10>. How many bandages did they start with on the <fact7>first day</fact7>?

Answer: Let's break down the bandage count day by day.

* **Day 3:** They started the day with an unknown number of bandages (let's call this 'x'). They ordered <fact4>two bulk packs</fact4>, adding <fact1>50</fact1> * 2 = 100 bandages. They then used <fact5>half a pack</fact5>, or 25 bandages.  At the end of Day 3, they had <fact10>78 bandages left</fact10>.  This means the equation for Day 3 is: x + 100 - 25 = 78. Solving for x, we find that they started Day 3 with x = 78 + 25 -100 = -23 bandages. Because you can't have a negative amount of bandages, we know there must have been an error in the data that states they only used half a pack on the third day. 

* **Day 2:** On the <fact7>first day</fact7>, they used <fact8>38 bandages</fact8>. On the <fact2>second day</fact2>, they used <fact6>ten fewer bandages compared to the first day</fact6>, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

* **Day 1:**  On the <fact7>first day</fact7>, they started with a certain number of bandages, used <fact8>38</fact8> bandages, and then received a <fact9>bulk pack of 50 bandages</fact9>. This shows their starting stock on day one was not a factor in the leftover bandages from the third day.

The problem statement contains conflicting information that is preventing the solution from being found. The number of bandages used on day 3 and the number left at the end of the third day are mathematically incongruent with the number of bandages used on days one and two. More data is needed.

What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?

Answer: The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is <fact6>$7,500</fact6>.  Therefore, the leather seats cost <fact6>$7,500</fact6> / 3 = $2,500. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.  The total cost of the added features is the sum of the king cab upgrade (<fact6>$7,500</fact6>), leather seats ($2,500), running boards ($2,000), and the upgraded exterior light package (<fact9>$1,500</fact9>).  This is $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500. The towing package cost is not given, however, we know that the base price of the truck is <fact1>$30,000</fact1>. Therefore the total cost of Bill's new truck is the base price plus the cost of the added features:  <fact1>$30,000</fact1> + $13,500 = $43,500.  Note that the problem does not state a price for the towing package, thus it is assumed to be included in the base price.  The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

If <fact5>Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</fact5>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: First, we need to convert miles to feet since Steve's biking speed and Tim's skateboarding speed are given in feet per minute.  There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Tim's distance from school is <fact2>2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet</fact2>.  His travel time is 10560 feet / <fact5>264 feet/minute</fact5> = 40 minutes.

Steve's distance from school is <fact3>3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet</fact3>. His travel time is 15840 feet / <fact4>440 feet/minute</fact4> = 36 minutes.

Since Steve (<fact1>lives further away</fact1> but) reaches home in 36 minutes and Tim in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner.  He will be waiting for Tim for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"Reformatted Question: It takes Julia <fact1>sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</fact1>. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on <fact2>two liters of water for every ten feet</fact2> she rowed back towards shore. The shore was <fact3>64 seconds away</fact3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?

Answer: First, we need to determine how far Julia rowed in the <fact3>64 seconds</fact3> it took her to reach the shore.  From <fact1>sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</fact1>, we can calculate her rowing speed:

(20 feet / 16 seconds) = 1.25 feet/second

Therefore, in <fact3>64 seconds</fact3>, she rowed 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Next, we use <fact2>two liters of water for every ten feet</fact2> to determine the total amount of water taken on.  Since she rowed 80 feet, we have:

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","Reformatted Question: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  <fact1>Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel</fact1>. When Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, <fact2>the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel</fact2>. <fact3>Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck</fact3>.  How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?

Answer:  Gissela's truck can haul <fact1>4,000 pounds</fact1> of gravel. Gordy's truck hauls <fact3>800 pounds more</fact3> than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.  <fact2>The three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds</fact2>.

They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in <fact5>two holes the pirates kept falling in</fact5>. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?

Answer: The number of holes at the end of the first day is <fact2>10 holes</fact2>.  According to <fact1>the statement that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day</fact1>, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.  The total number of holes dug in the first three days was 10 + 13 + (8 - 2) = 29 holes (note: we subtract 2 because they filled in 2 holes). To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total from the first three days from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes. Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

166,"Mr. Robles' first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Robles' <fact1>first monkey eats 10 bananas each day</fact1>. Mr. Robles <fact2>buys 315 bananas</fact2>, which is <fact3>enough to feed his three monkeys for a week</fact3>. The <fact4>second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4> and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Answer:  First, let's find the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.  Since <fact3>315 bananas are enough for a week</fact3>, this is our total. A week has 7 days.

Next, let's determine how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week: <fact1>The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day</fact1>, so in a week, it eats 10 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 70 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the second monkey eats each day. <fact4>The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4>, so it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.  In a week, the second monkey eats 14 bananas/day * 7 days/week = 98 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the three monkeys eat in total each day, we need to look at the total number of bananas and how long they last. The <fact3>total bananas last for one week (7 days)</fact3>, and the total is <fact2>315 bananas</fact2>. Thus, the combined daily consumption is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

Finally, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. The total daily consumption is 45 bananas. The first monkey eats 10 bananas, and the second monkey eats 14 bananas.  Therefore, the third monkey eats 45 - 10 - 14 = 21 bananas each day.

The answer is {21}.

The <fact4>first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, but <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Answer:  The solo song has <fact1>54 lines</fact1>. The second scene has 54 + <fact2>6</fact2> = 60 lines, and Sean has to memorize (4/5) * 60 = 48 of those lines (<fact3>four-fifths</fact3>). The first scene has 54 * <fact4>2</fact4> = 108 lines, and Sean has to memorize (1/3) * 108 = 36 of those lines (<fact5>only a third</fact5>).

No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Reformatted Question: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1> that are kept alone and <fact2>each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw</fact2>. The rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3> and <fact4>each rat is given 6 pieces of straw</fact4>. There is also a pen of rabbits where <fact5>20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</fact5>. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters.  There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1>, and <fact2>each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw</fact2>.  Therefore, 10 hamsters * 5 pieces of straw/hamster = 50 pieces of straw were used for the hamsters.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the rabbits.  The question states that <fact5>20 pieces of straw were distributed among the rabbits</fact5>.

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total amount of straw distributed to find the amount used for rats: <fact6>160 total pieces of straw</fact6> - 50 pieces (hamsters) - 20 pieces (rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

Since <fact4>each rat receives 6 pieces of straw</fact4>, we can determine the total number of rats: 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw/rat = 15 rats.

Finally, because the rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3>, there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.  The answer is {5}.

How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","Reformatted Question: Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans. It takes <fact1>75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up</fact1>.  Eating <fact2>3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean</fact2>. He can eat <fact3>twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans</fact3>. How many small beans can Grandpa eat?

Answer: We know from <fact1>the question that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up</fact1>.  According to <fact3>the question, Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans</fact3>, so he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.  From <fact2>the question, we know that 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean</fact2>.  Therefore, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by 3: 150 medium beans * 3 small beans/medium bean = 450 small beans.  So Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans. The answer is {450}.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of each item before the discount.

* **Notebooks:** <fact1>Five notebooks</fact1> cost 5 * <fact6>$1.50</fact6> = $7.50
* **Pens:** <fact2>Two pens</fact2> cost 2 * <fact7>$0.25</fact7> = $0.50
* **Calculator:** The calculator costs <fact8>$12</fact8>.
* **Geometry Set:** The geometry set costs <fact9>$10</fact9>.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Among those that are not indoor plants, <fact3>two-thirds of them are outdoor plants</fact3> while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?

Answer:  First, let's find the number of indoor plants.  Since <fact2>one-fourth of her 100 plants are indoor plants</fact2>, there are (1/4) * 100 = 25 indoor plants.

Next, let's find the number of plants that are not indoor plants. This is the total number of plants minus the number of indoor plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Now, let's determine the number of outdoor plants.  <fact3>Two-thirds of the plants that are not indoor plants are outdoor plants</fact3>.  So there are (2/3) * 75 = 50 outdoor plants.

Finally, to find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the number of plants that are not indoor plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

Therefore, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering plants.  This represents (25/100) * 100% = 25% of the plants.

The answer is {25}.

It includes hanging <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>, <fact6>2 shelves</fact6>, <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>, and <fact8>10 pictures</fact8>. They will install additional items for an extra <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9>. How much will this cost her?

Answer: The interior design firm's basic installation package (<fact4>$129.00</fact4>) includes <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>, <fact6>2 shelves</fact6>, <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>, and <fact8>10 pictures</fact8>.  Angela needs <fact1>6 mirrors</fact1>, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors installed.  She also needs <fact2>2 chandeliers</fact2>, so she needs 2 -1 = 1 additional chandelier installed. Lastly, she needs <fact3>20 pictures</fact3>, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures installed.

The additional cost will be (2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures) * <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9> = 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be the basic installation cost plus the additional cost: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.  The answer is {324}.

185,"Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  The bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?","Reformatted Question: Tom has <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1> in his house. The <fact2>living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>. The <fact3>rest of the house is 1000 square feet</fact3>. The <fact4>bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each</fact4>. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?

Answer: First, we need to find the area of one bedroom.  From <fact4>the bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each</fact4>, the area of one bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Next, we find the area of the living room.  Since <fact2>the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>, its area is 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

Now we calculate the total area of all the bedrooms. Since Tom has <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1>, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 square feet = 960 square feet.

Finally, we add up all the areas to find the total area of the house.  The total area is the area of the bedrooms (960 square feet) plus the area of the living room (1200 square feet) plus <fact3>the rest of the house (1000 square feet)</fact3>.  Therefore, the total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The answer is {3160}.

He also buys a finale firework that costs <fact4>$150</fact4>. How much did he spend in total?

Answer: The first package of fireworks cost <fact1>$400</fact1>. The second package cost twice that much, or 2 * <fact1>$400</fact1> = $800.  Together, the two packages cost $400 + $800 = $1200.  Tim received a <fact3>20% discount</fact3>, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.  So the discounted price of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

She wanted to try something new, so she paid <fact5>half as much for a small pack of green apple gum</fact5>. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Answer: Suzie bought a total of four packs of gum and spent $7.  She bought one pack of grape gum for $2 (<fact4>$2 for a pack of grape gum</fact4>). The green apple gum cost half the price of the grape gum, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1 (<fact5>half as much for a small pack of green apple gum</fact5>).  Therefore, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum was $2 + $1 = $3.  Since she spent $7 in total (<fact2>She paid $7 in all</fact2>), the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. Finally, since she bought two packs of strawberry gum (<fact3>two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry</fact3>), each pack of strawberry gum cost $4 / 2 = $2. The answer is {2}.

Answer:  Mark's total cost was <fact4>3 packs * $1800/pack</fact4> = $5400.  The value of his cards is the sum of the high-value cards (<fact1>$4000</fact1> + <fact2>$1000</fact2> = $5000) plus the value of the remaining cards (<fact3>30 cards * $50/card</fact3> = $1500).

What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?

Answer: First, we need to determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.  Since he bought it at <fact3>75% of its original price</fact3>, he paid 0.75 * <fact2>$2000</fact2> = $1500.

Next, we find the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.  He sold it at <fact1>120% of the price he bought it</fact1>, so he sold it for 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.

Finally, we calculate the percentage discount Mr. Roger's friend received. The discount is the difference between the original price and the selling price, divided by the original price, all multiplied by 100% to express it as a percentage.  The discount is (<fact2>$2000</fact2> - $1800) / <fact2>$2000</fact2> * 100% = $200 / $2000 * 100% = 10%.

He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer:  First, we calculate the distance James swam: <fact2>60%</fact2> of <fact1>20 miles</fact1> is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

Next, we determine how long it took him to swim this distance:  Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3> = 6 hours.

Then, we find out how long he rested:  He rested for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's figure out the remaining distance:  The remaining distance is <fact1>20 miles</fact1> - 12 miles = 8 miles.

He finished the remaining distance at half his original speed: <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3> / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Finally, we calculate the time it took him to finish the remaining distance: Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

To find the total time, we add up all the times: 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

Therefore, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is {17}.

202,"Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\""  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?","Reformatted Question: Sally went to the seashore for vacation. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for <fact1>“Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.”</fact1> She scooped up <fact2>2 pounds</fact2>. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for <fact3>$1.50</fact3> and <fact4>4 magnets that were $0.25 each</fact4>. Her parents gave her <fact5>$10</fact5> to buy whatever she wanted. How much money does Sally have left?

Answer:  The taffy sale is <fact1>“Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.”</fact1>, meaning the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3/2 = $1.50.  Therefore, the total cost of the <fact2>2 pounds</fact2> of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The seashells cost <fact3>$1.50</fact3>.

The magnets cost <fact4>4 magnets * $0.25/magnet</fact4> = $1.00.

Sally's total spending is $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.

Her parents gave her <fact5>$10</fact5>, so she has $10 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

The answer is {3}.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Reformatted Question: Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The <fact1>first venue charges a flat fee of $200</fact1>, <fact2>regardless of how many guests attend</fact2>. At the <fact3>second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price</fact3>. The <fact3>second venue charges $25 per person</fact3> who attends. However, the <fact1>first venue does not include food</fact1>, which Mark estimates will cost <fact4>$5 for each person who attends</fact4>. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer: Let's say 'x' represents the number of guests.

The total cost of the first venue is the flat fee plus the cost of food per guest:  <fact1>$200</fact1> + (<fact4>$5</fact4> * x)

The total cost of the second venue is the cost per guest: (<fact3>$25</fact3> * x)

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Dividing both sides by $20:

x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Reformatted Question: Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>. He retrieved <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve <fact3>four more balls than in the second set</fact3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?

Answer: Let's use variables to represent the number of balls retrieved in each set:

* Let 'x' be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
* The number of balls retrieved in the third set is <fact1>half as many as in the second</fact1>, so it's x/2.
* The number of balls retrieved in the first set is <fact3>four more than in the second set</fact3>, so it's x + 4.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets:

x + x/2 + x + 4 = <fact2>19</fact2>

Now we solve for x:

2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The answer is {10}.

After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a <fact4>10% discount</fact4> because of the amount of work done. The movie took <fact5>5 weeks</fact5> to finish. How much did Jean pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked.  She worked <fact2>6 hours per day</fact2> * <fact3>4 days per week</fact3> = 24 hours per week. Over the <fact5>5 weeks</fact5> of filming, the total hours were 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours. The total cost before discount would be 120 hours * <fact1>$250/hour</fact1> = $30,000.  The discount is <fact4>10%</fact4>, so the discount amount is $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000.  Therefore, Jean's final cost is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000. The answer is {27000}.

At the start of the game, <fact4>Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons</fact4>. How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?

Answer:  There were a total of 5 girls participating in the water balloon fight (<fact1>4 friends</fact1> + <fact2>Maria</fact2>).  Maria's mom gave each girl 3 additional water balloons (<fact3>3 more balloons</fact3>), resulting in 5 girls * 3 balloons/girl = 15 balloons.  Before this, Maria gave 2 water balloons to each of her 4 friends (<fact4>Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons</fact4>), meaning she gave away 2 balloons/friend * 4 friends = 8 balloons. Considering Maria initially had 1 balloon (<fact2>Maria had one water balloon</fact2>), she had 1 - 8 = -7 balloons after giving them away.  In total, the girls ended up with 15 balloons (from their mom) + 1 balloon (Maria's original balloon)- 8 balloons (Maria gave away) = 8 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had at the end was 15 + 1 -8 = 8 balloons. However, this seems incorrect, given that Maria is included in the total number of girls, and she started with one balloon. Therefore, the total balloons after her mom's contribution is 15 + 1=16. The girls had a total of 16 balloons at the end of the game.

On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Billy's starting pay was $10 per hour</fact1>. <fact2>Sally's starting pay is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was</fact2>. After 2 months, <fact3>Billy received a $0.50 per hour raise</fact3>. On his first anniversary, <fact4>he received a $1.00 per hour raise</fact4>. If both Billy and Sally work <fact5>20 hours</fact5>, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?

Answer: Sally's starting hourly rate is <fact1>$10</fact1> + <fact2>$0.50</fact2> = $10.50 per hour.  Over <fact5>20 hours</fact5>, Sally earns $10.50 * <fact5>20</fact5> = $210.

After 2 months, Billy's hourly rate became <fact1>$10</fact1> + <fact3>$0.50</fact3> = $10.50 per hour.  On his anniversary, his rate increased to $10.50 + <fact4>$1.00</fact4> = $11.50 per hour.

To calculate Billy's total earnings, we need to consider his different hourly rates during the year. Let's assume a year has 12 months and 4 weeks in each month. There are 4 weeks * 12 months= 48 weeks in a year. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so 2 months is 8 weeks.  The total number of weeks is 48 weeks and there are approximately 20 hours per week.  Hence, Billy will work for 48 weeks * 20 hours/week = 960 hours.  For the first 8 weeks, Billy worked 8 weeks * 20 hours/week = 160 hours at $10 per hour. This earned him 160 * $10 = $1600.  For the remaining 40 weeks, Billy's hourly wage was $11.50. In 40 weeks, Billy worked 40 weeks * 20 hours/week = 800 hours. His earnings for that period are 800 * $11.50 = $9200.  Billy's total earnings in the year is $1600 + $9200 = $10800.

However, the question asks how much more Billy earns than Sally in 20 hours of work.  If both work 20 hours, Sally earns $210. Billy's pay is $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230. Therefore, Billy earned $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

The answer is {20}.

The remaining money was used to buy <fact4>2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each</fact4>. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since a dozen is 12, and they got 2 balloons for $0.5, they bought 12 / 2 = 6 sets of balloons.  The total cost of the balloons was 6 * $0.5 = $3.

Next, let's find the total cost of the ice cream.  They bought <fact4>2 tubs</fact4> at $7 each, so that cost them 2 * $7 = $14.

Now we can determine the total amount spent on the birthday surprise.  This was the cost of the cake (<fact1>$11</fact1>) plus the balloons ($3) plus the ice cream ($14), which equals $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine received the same amount of allowance, they each contributed half of the total cost. Therefore, each girl's allowance was $28 / 2 = $14.

If Sara <fact5>already had $10 saved</fact5> before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.  The jacket costs <fact1>$30</fact1>, and two pairs of shoes cost 2 * <fact2>$20</fact2> = $40.  Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's figure out how much money Sara earned babysitting.  She babysat <fact4>4 times</fact4> and earned <fact4>$5 each time</fact4>, so she earned 4 * $5 = $20 babysitting.

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, Sara has <fact5>$10</fact5> + $20 = $30.

Finally, she needs $70 total, and already has $30, meaning she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Since her parents pay her <fact3>$4 for each lawn she mows</fact3>, she needs to mow $40 / <fact3>$4</fact3> = 10 lawns.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The total area of the large t-shirts is the number of large shirts multiplied by the area of one large shirt: <fact6>6 shirts</fact6> * <fact1>6 square feet/shirt</fact1> = 36 square feet.  Therefore, the total area of the quilt is the sum of the areas of the small, medium, and large t-shirts: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. The answer is {101}.

221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"Reformatted Question: Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps</fact1> on the track in one hour. Quinn can run <fact2>2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</fact2>. Shaelyn can run <fact3>half as many laps as Trey</fact3>. Trey can run <fact4>4 more laps than Bethany</fact4>. How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?

Answer:  First, we need to determine how many laps Trey can run.  From <fact4>“Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany,”</fact4> and knowing Bethany runs <fact1>10 laps</fact1>, Trey runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Next, we find out how many laps Shaelyn runs.  <fact3>“Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey,”</fact3> so Shaelyn runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Finally, we calculate how many laps Quinn runs.  <fact2>“Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn,”</fact2> meaning Quinn runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Therefore, Bethany runs 10 laps and Quinn runs 5 laps.  Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

The answer is {5}.

222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"Reformatted Question: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A <fact1>2 x 4 costs $4</fact1>. A <fact2>2 x 8 costs $6</fact2>. He can get <fact3>200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood</fact3> and <fact4>400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood</fact4>. He has <fact5>$24 to buy wood for sticks</fact5>. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer:  The question asks for the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make using the cheapest lumber and his budget of <fact5>$24</fact5>.  Comparing the cost per stick from a <fact1>2 x 4 ($4 for 200 sticks)</fact1> and a <fact2>2 x 8 ($6 for 400 sticks)</fact2>, we find the cost per stick:

* **2 x 4:** $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick
* **2 x 8:** $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

The <fact2>2 x 8</fact2> lumber is cheaper.  With <fact5>$24</fact5>, he can buy $24 / $6 per 2x8 = 4 pieces of <fact2>2 x 8</fact2> lumber.  Each <fact2>2 x 8</fact2> yields <fact4>400 sticks</fact4>, so 4 pieces will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 popsicle sticks. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

223,"Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","Reformatted Question: Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a <fact1>case of 12 sodas</fact1> and <fact2>shook 3 of them up</fact2>. Ellen's brother stopped by and <fact3>took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas</fact3>, then Ellen's friend came along. By this point, Ellen had <fact4>taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left</fact4>. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Answer:  Initially, Ellen had <fact1>12 sodas</fact1>, with <fact2>3 shaken</fact2>.  After Ellen's brother took <fact3>1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas</fact3>, there were 2 shaken sodas remaining (3 - 1 = 2).  After Ellen <fact4>took 1 unshaken soda</fact4>, there were still 2 shaken sodas.  The total number of sodas left is now 8 (12 - 1 - 2 -1 = 8).  Therefore, the probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4.  Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/4) * 100% = 25%.  The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda is 25%.

Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"Reformatted Question: Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. They each get one watermelon. <fact1>Zoey's has 40 seeds</fact1> and she spits each one <fact2>10 feet</fact2>. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. <fact3>Sydney's has 35 seeds</fact3> and she spits each one <fact4>12 feet</fact4>. What is the average total distance spat?

Answer: Zoey spat her seeds a total distance of <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet/seed</fact2> = 400 feet. Sydney spat her seeds a total distance of <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> * <fact4>12 feet/seed</fact4> = 420 feet.  Together, they spat a total distance of 400 + 420 = 820 feet. To find the average distance, we divide the total distance by the number of people: 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet. The average total distance spat is 410 feet.

225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reformatted Question: Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>. The other is an unknown temperature <fact2>(x degrees)</fact2>. If he pours <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> of water from the <fact1>33-degree mug</fact1> into his water bottle and <fact4>one ounce</fact4> from the other bottle <fact2>(x degrees)</fact2>, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Answer: Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as 'x' degrees.  Donny pours <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> from the 33-degree mug and <fact4>1 ounce</fact4> from the x-degree mug. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces.

To find the final temperature of the mixture, we can use a weighted average:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces >= <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>

This inequality represents the condition that the final temperature must be at least <fact5>40 degrees</fact5> for Donny to drink the water.

Solving for x:

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40
132 + x >= 200
x >= 200 - 132
x >= 68

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees. The answer is {68}.

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Reformatted Question: Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>. Over the <fact2>third year</fact2> it depreciated <fact3>20%</fact3>. Over the <fact4>first year</fact4> it depreciated <fact5>30%</fact5>. The <fact6>second year</fact6> it depreciated another <fact5>30%</fact5>. How much is the boat worth after the <fact7>three years</fact7>?

Answer: After the <fact4>first year</fact4>, the boat's value was <fact1>$9000</fact1> - (<fact1>$9000</fact1> * <fact5>30%</fact5>) = <fact1>$9000</fact1> - $2700 = $6300.  After the <fact6>second year</fact6>, the boat's value was $6300 - ($6300 * <fact5>30%</fact5>) = $6300 - $1890 = $4410. Finally, after the <fact2>third year</fact2>, the boat's value was $4410 - ($4410 * <fact3>20%</fact3>) = $4410 - $882 = $3528. Therefore, after the <fact7>three years</fact7>, the boat is worth $3528.
