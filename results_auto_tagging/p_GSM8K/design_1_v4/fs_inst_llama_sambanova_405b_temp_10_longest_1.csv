How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Reformatted Question: 
Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by <fact1>$50 each time</fact1> and <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2>. She accepts the <fact3>opening bid of $200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer: 
Carmen starts with the <fact3>opening bid of $200</fact3>. Since <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2> and Carmen bids after each of them, she will have to bid 3 more times after her initial bid. Each time the bid increases by <fact1>$50</fact1>, so she will have to pay an additional <fact1>$50</fact1> * 3 = $150. Therefore, the desk will cost her <fact3>$200</fact3> + $150 = $350. The answer is {350}."
1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Reformatted Question: 
Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with <fact1>5 games for his birthday</fact1>.  For the <fact2>third year he buys 4 games a month</fact2> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas every year</fact3>.  He saves up enough money to buy <fact4>1 game per month for a year</fact4>, and then the <fact5>second year he starts buying 2 games a month</fact5>.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?

Answer: 
Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1>. For the first year, he buys <fact4>1 game per month</fact4> * 12 months = 12 games and gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>, for a total of 12 + 5 = 17 games. For the <fact5>second year, he buys 2 games a month</fact5> * 12 months = 24 games and gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. For the <fact2>third year, he buys 4 games a month</fact2> * 12 months = 48 games and gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. So, after 3 years, Steve has <fact1>5</fact1> + 17 + 29 + 53 = 104 games. The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact2>a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but only about <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer: To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply that by the total number of potatoes. It takes Billy <fact2>a minute and a half (or 1.5 minutes or 90 seconds) to peel a potato</fact2> and <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. Since there are <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1>, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 * <fact1>60</fact1> = 5700 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes. The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: 
James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>.  He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>.  Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>.  He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>.  How much money was he out?

Answer: 
James bought <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1> at a cost of <fact4>$15</fact4> each. However, he got them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>, so he paid only 60% of the original price. The cost of each CD would be <fact4>$15</fact4> * 0.6 = $9. The total cost of the CDs would be <fact1>10</fact1> * $9 = $90. James then sold <fact2>5 of them</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>, so he recovered some of the cost. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the total cost: $90 - <fact3>$40</fact3> = $50. The answer is {50}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1>. One-<fact2>fourth of the seats</fact2> were occupied by the administrators. One-<fact3>third of the remaining seats</fact3> were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer: There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1> and <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>, so the auditorium has <fact1>18 seats per row</fact1> * <fact4>4 rows</fact4> = 72 seats. Since one-<fact2>fourth of the seats</fact2> were occupied by the administrators, that is 72 * 1/4 = 18 seats. The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54. Since one-<fact3>third of the remaining seats</fact3> were occupied by the parents, that is 54 * 1/3 = 18 seats. Therefore, the number of students in the auditorium is 54 - 18 = 36. The answer is {36}."
5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall.

Answer: 
Milo has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, so he has <fact1>72 chips</fact1> * 2 = 144 chips. It takes <fact3>12 chips to make each square inch</fact3>, so he can make 144 / <fact3>12 chips per square inch</fact3> = 12 square inches. Since his mosaic will be <fact2>3 inches tall</fact2>, he can make it 12 / <fact2>3 inches tall</fact2> = 4 inches long. The answer is {4}."
6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Reformatted Question: 
Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The first needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>. On average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>. The third needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. How many miles does the last dog need?

Answer: 
To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all dogs need to walk. Since there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> and they need to walk an average of <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>, the total miles they need to walk is <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> * <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3> = 12 miles. 

We already know that the first dog needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>, and the third needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. So the miles walked by the first three dogs is <fact2>1 mile</fact2> + <fact4>4 miles</fact4> + <fact5>3 miles</fact5> = 8 miles.

Thus, the last dog needs to walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles. The answer is {4}."

Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron <fact3>$120 for unauthorized road maintenance</fact3> if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Answer: 
If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to pay for the buckets of asphalt, which will cost him <fact2>3 buckets</fact2> * $25 = $75. He will also have to pay the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is <fact3>$120</fact3>. So, in total, he will have to pay $75 + $120 = $195 to fix the pothole himself. However, if he doesn't fix the pothole, it will do <fact1>$450 worth of damage to his car</fact1>. Therefore, by fixing the pothole himself, Ron will save $450 - $195 = $255. The answer is {255}."
9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.

Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>.  His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> to remove the old carpet, and <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is <fact1>18 feet * 12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet. To remove the old carpet, the contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> * 216 square feet = $864. To install the new carpet, the contractor charges <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> * 216 square feet = $7344. The new carpet itself costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> * 216 square feet = $2592. Additionally, the padding underneath costs <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5> * 216 square feet = $432. Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet is $864 + $7344 + $2592 + $432 = $11232. The answer is {11232}."

While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of <fact5>500 apples</fact5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer: 
Joanne gathered <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1> and <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, which is 30/2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered <fact3>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact3>, which is 2 x 30 = 60 apples, and <fact4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact4>, which is 3 x 15 = 45 apples. In total, Joanne's sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples. Joanne and her sister gathered a combined total of <fact5>500 apples</fact5>, so Joanne must have gathered 500 - 105 = 395 apples. Since we know that Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she must have gathered 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is {350}."
11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Reformatted Question: 
Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>.  Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>.  Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: 
To find out how much money Pat will spend, we first need to find out how many flowers she needs to buy. Since Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> and she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>, we need to convert the width of the flowers to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the flowers grow 12/12 = 1 foot wide. 

The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between plants, which is 1 foot + <fact4>1.5 feet</fact4> = 2.5 feet. 

The total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is the length of the flower bed divided by the space required for each plant, which is <fact1>111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. 

Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 flowers. 

Since each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>, Pat will spend 27 * <fact5>$6</fact5> = $162. The answer is {162}."

How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the total time John spent on the activities that took up <fact2>30% of his time</fact2>. He spent <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and half that time <fact4>swimming</fact4>, which is 6/2 = 3 hours. He also watched <fact5>3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact5>, for a total of 3 x 2 = 6 hours. So the total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since these activities took up <fact2>30% of his time</fact2>, we can set up the equation 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time John spent on vacation. Solving for x, we get x = 15/0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, we can calculate the time John spent sightseeing, which is <fact1>40% of his time</fact1>. 0.4 x 50 = 20 hours.

The answer is {20}."

If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer: 
The teacher starts with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1>. He used up <fact4>45% of the chalk</fact4> on the first day, so he has 5 - 0.45*5 = 2.75 inches of chalk left. The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>. So, he can use 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk before recycling it. The teacher will use <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, which is 0.2*5 = 1 inch of chalk per day for a full piece of chalk. For the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk that can be used, it is 0.75/1 = 0.75 or 75% of the amount of chalk that can be used per day. Since the teacher can use <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3> for a full piece of chalk, he can use the remaining chalk for 0.75/0.2 = 3.75 days.

Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is <fact1>14 feet wide</fact1>, <fact2>25 feet long</fact2>, and <fact3>4 feet deep</fact3>. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by <fact4>5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need</fact4>. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is <fact5>$0.10 per gallon</fact5>. How much will it cost to fill the pool?

Answer: 
To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we first need to find the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the length is <fact2>25 feet</fact2>, the width is <fact1>14 feet</fact1>, and the height is <fact3>4 feet</fact3>. So, the volume of the pool is <fact2>25</fact2> * <fact1>14</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 1400 cubic feet. 

Since the pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by <fact4>5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need</fact4>, we multiply 1400 cubic feet by 5.9 to get 8260 gallons. 

Finally, to calculate the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon, which is <fact5>$0.10 per gallon</fact5>. Therefore, the total cost is 8260 gallons * <fact5>$0.10 per gallon</fact5> = $826. The answer is {826}."

18,Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.  The bag has 36 cookies and she puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.  How many cookies does Jenny eat?,"Reformatted Question: 
Jenny buys <fact1>1 bag of cookies a week</fact1>. Her husband eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>. The bag has <fact3>36 cookies</fact3> and she puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>. Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. How many cookies does Jenny eat?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Jenny's husband. He eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>, so he eats a total of 1 * 7 = 7 cookies. Next, we need to calculate the total number of cookies put in the son's lunch box. Jenny puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>, so she puts a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies in the lunch box. Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Jenny. The bag has <fact3>36 cookies</fact3>, and her husband eats 7 cookies and her son eats 20 cookies. So, Jenny eats 36 - 7 - 20 = 9 cookies. The answer is {9}."
19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted Question: A <fact1>gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</fact1> and <fact2>cost $12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: To find the cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>, so their combined area is 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>, so their combined area is 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total area is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since a <fact1>gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</fact1>, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint. Each gallon <fact2>costs $12</fact2>, so the total cost is 12 * $12 = $144. The answer is {144}."

On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>.  <fact2>24 guests</fact2> elected an early checkout and <fact3>15 guests</fact3> elected for a late checkout.  <fact5>7 more people</fact5> checked in after dinner was served.  In the afternoon <fact4>twice as many people</fact4> checked in as those who opted for a <fact3>late checkout</fact3>.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?

Answer: 
The hotel started with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. Then, <fact2>24 guests</fact2> checked out early, so the hotel had <fact1>100</fact1> - <fact2>24</fact2> = 76 guests. In the afternoon, <fact4>twice as many people</fact4> checked in as those who opted for a <fact3>late checkout</fact3>, so <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 30 people checked in. This brought the total number of guests to 76 + 30 = 106. Then, <fact3>15 guests</fact3> checked out late, so the hotel had 106 - <fact3>15</fact3> = 91 guests. Finally, <fact5>7 more people</fact5> checked in after dinner, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + <fact5>7</fact5> = 98. The answer is {98}."

He only picked up <fact3>3 in total</fact3>. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?

Answer: Brendan started with <fact1>10 marbles</fact1>. He dropped <fact2>half of them</fact2>, which is 10/2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. He then picked up <fact3>3 in total</fact3>, but one of them was a bead, so he actually picked up 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Now, he has the 5 marbles he didn't drop, plus the 2 marbles he picked up, for a total of 5 + 2 = 7 marbles. The answer is {7}."
22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Reformatted Question: Today is December <fact1>31st</fact1>. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact2>30 lbs</fact2>. by his birthday, which is July <fact3>19th</fact3>. If Andy needs to burn <fact4>3500 calories</fact4> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal. Since he wants to lose <fact2>30 lbs</fact2> and it takes <fact4>3500 calories</fact4> to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of <fact2>30</fact2> * <fact4>3500</fact4> = 105000 calories.

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. From December <fact1>31st</fact1> to July <fact3>19th</fact3>, there are approximately 201 days (December has 31 days, January to June have 181 days, and July has 19 days).

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal. We divide the total number of calories he needs to burn (105000) by the number of days he has to reach his goal (201). This gives us a daily calorie deficit of 105000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

The answer is {522}."

If Artie sells <fact4>12 pots of marigolds</fact4>, <fact5>9 pots of petunias</fact5> and <fact6>17 pots of begonias</fact6>, how much will he make?

Answer: Artie will round his prices to the nearest dollar. So, marigolds will cost $3 per pot, petunias will cost $2 per pot and begonias will cost $2 per pot. Artie sells <fact4>12 pots of marigolds</fact4> at $3 each, so he will make <fact4>12</fact4> * 3 = $36 from marigolds. He sells <fact5>9 pots of petunias</fact5> at $2 each, so he will make <fact5>9</fact5> * 2 = $18 from petunias. He sells <fact6>17 pots of begonias</fact6> at $2 each, so he will make <fact6>17</fact6> * 2 = $34 from begonias. Therefore, Artie will make a total of $36 + $18 + $34 = $88. The answer is {88}."

On days one and two, Mack saw a total of <fact5>50 birds</fact5>. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?

Answer: 
To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to find the total number of birds he saw and divide it by the number of days. Mack saw <fact1>0 birds</fact1> on day three, <fact2>120 birds</fact2> on days four and five, <fact3>20 birds</fact3> on day six, and <fact4>90 birds</fact4> on day seven. He also saw <fact5>50 birds</fact5> on days one and two. So the total number of birds he saw is 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 + 50 = 280. Since Mack counted birds for 7 days, we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average. The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 280 / 7 = 40. The answer is {40}."

How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?

Answer: 
In the first 30 seconds, <fact5>20 kernels popped</fact5>. In the next 30 seconds, <fact6>three times that amount</fact6> popped, which is 20 * 3 = 60 kernels. So in the first 60 seconds, 20 + 60 = 80 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is <fact1>four times the initial popping rate</fact1>, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. But since the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 30 seconds</fact4> in the <fact3>final 30 seconds</fact3>, the popping rate in the final 30 seconds is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Answer: 
Since <fact5>a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs</fact5> and <fact6>each pepper costs 15$</fact6>, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$. Since <fact1>an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost</fact1>, an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$. To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he is buying. The total cost of <fact2>4 watermelons</fact2> is 4 * 45 = 180$. The total cost of <fact3>20 peppers</fact3> is 20 * 15 = 300$. The total cost of <fact4>10 oranges</fact4> is 10 * 40 = 400$.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","Reformatted Question: 
Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the <fact1>second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact1>. On the <fact2>first race, he lost $5</fact2>. On the <fact3>third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact3>. How much did he lose on average that day?

Answer: 
On the <fact2>first race, Johnny's dad lost $5</fact2>. On the <fact1>second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact1>. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race. On the <fact3>third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact3>, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. The total amount he lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. The total number of races is 3. Therefore, the average amount he lost is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17. The answer is {7.17}."

James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys <fact1>10 suits</fact1> and <fact2>10 dress pants</fact2>.  The <fact3>suits cost $750 each</fact3> and the <fact4>dress pants cost 1/5 that cost</fact4>.  He also buys <fact5>3 dress shirts per suit</fact5>.  The <fact6>dress shirts were $60 each</fact6>.  How much did everything cost?

Answer: 
The total cost of the suits is <fact1>10 suits</fact1> * <fact3>$750 per suit</fact3> = $7500. The cost of the dress pants is 1/5 * <fact3>$750 per suit</fact3> = $150 per pair of dress pants. So the total cost of the dress pants is <fact2>10 dress pants</fact2> * $150 per pair of dress pants = $1500. The total number of dress shirts purchased is <fact1>10 suits</fact1> * <fact5>3 dress shirts per suit</fact5> = 30 dress shirts. The total cost of the dress shirts is 30 dress shirts * <fact6>$60 per dress shirt</fact6> = $1800. Therefore, the total cost of everything is $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800. The answer is {10800}."

One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact5>1.5 times as long</fact5>.  How much money is used?

Answer: 
Since Jack can play a game for <fact2>20 minutes</fact2> with <fact1>1 quarter</fact1>, he can play a game for 60 minutes with 3 quarters. Two of his friends are worse and can only play <fact3>half as long</fact3>, so they can play a game for 60 minutes with 6 quarters. One of his friends is better and can play <fact5>1.5 times as long</fact5>, so he can play a game for 60 minutes with 2 quarters. Since they play for <fact4>4 hours</fact4>, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240/60 * 3 = 12 quarters, two of his friends will use 240/60 * 6 = 24 quarters each, and his other friend will use 240/60 * 2 = 8 quarters. Therefore, the total amount of money used is (12 + 24 + 24 + 8) * $0.25 = $17. The answer is {17}."

Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has <fact1>600 movies</fact1>.  <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies</fact2> which are $5.  <fact3>A third of the movies are in various series</fact3> and he knows he can get those for only <fact4>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact4> by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if <fact5>a normal movie costs $10</fact5>?

Answer: 
First, we need to determine how many movies are in series and how many are not. Since <fact3>a third of the movies are in series</fact3>, the number of movies in series is <fact1>600 movies</fact1> * 1/3 = 200 movies. The number of movies not in series is <fact1>600 movies</fact1> - 200 movies = 400 movies. 

Next, we need to determine how many of the non-series movies are older movies. Since <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies</fact2>, the number of older movies is 400 movies * 0.4 = 160 movies. The number of non-series, non-older movies is 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies.

The cost of the older movies is 160 movies * $5 = $800. The cost of the non-series, non-older movies is 240 movies * <fact5>$10</fact5> = $2400. The cost of the series movies is 200 movies * (<fact5>$10</fact5> - <fact4>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact4> + <fact4>$6</fact4>) * (1 - <fact4>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact4> / <fact5>$10</fact5>) = 200 movies * $4 = $800 * 3/5 * 5/3 = 200 movies * $6 * 4/6 = $800 * 4/5 = $640.

Therefore, the total cost of replacing the movies is $800 + $2400 + $640 = $3840."

Out of the <fact4>remaining class</fact4>, <fact5>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact5>.  How many students are leaving early?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since <fact3>20% of the class are football players</fact3> and there are <fact2>30 students</fact2> in total, the number of football players is <fact3>20%</fact3> * <fact2>30</fact2> = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students. 

Now, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4>. Since there are <fact2>30 students</fact2> in total and 6 students are football players, the number of students in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4> is <fact2>30</fact2> - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band. Since <fact5>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact5> in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4> and there are 24 students in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4>, the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of band is <fact5>25%</fact5> * 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we need to find out the total number of students who are leaving early. Since the students who are leaving early are <fact1>football players, cheerleaders or part of band</fact1>, the total number of students who are leaving early is 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or part of band) = 12 students. The answer is {12}."

A <fact6>tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons</fact6>. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

Answer: 
On the first day, Wanda filled <fact2>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact2>, which is <fact6>18000 gallons</fact6> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact3>3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped</fact3>, which is 4500 * <fact3>3/4</fact3> = 3375 gallons. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact4>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact4>, which is 4500 * <fact4>2/3</fact4> = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact5>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact5>, which is 3375 * <fact5>1/3</fact5> = 1125 gallons. In total, they pumped 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. Since the <fact6>tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons</fact6>, the remaining capacity is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Answer: 
George needs to pay for <fact1>2 implants</fact1>, and each implant has a <fact2>base price of $2000</fact2>, so the cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. He also needs to pay for a <fact3>crown that costs an extra $500</fact3>, so the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

But, the third week, Boris produces <fact3>three times as much as the first week</fact3>. Boris produces <fact4>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact4>. How much does he produce the fourth week?

Answer: 
Since Boris produces <fact1>50,000 bars of chocolate each month</fact1> and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how much he produces in the first three weeks to determine the production in the fourth week. Boris produces <fact4>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact4>. The second week, he produces <fact2>half as much as the first week</fact2>, which is <fact4>8,000</fact4> / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week, he produces <fact3>three times as much as the first week</fact3>, which is <fact4>8,000</fact4> * 3 = 24,000 bars. So, the total production in the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. To reach the monthly production of <fact1>50,000 bars</fact1>, the production in the fourth week should be <fact1>50,000</fact1> - 36,000 = 14,000 bars. The answer is {14,000}."

What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer: 
To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to calculate the charge that was lost after she started charging her friends' phones and then work backward to find the initial charge. Since the battery lost <fact5>7% of the total capacity each hour</fact5> for about <fact6>3 hours</fact6>, it lost 7% * 3 = 21% of its total capacity. Before that, it had lost <fact2>9% of the total capacity each hour</fact2> for <fact4>5 hours</fact4>, so it lost 9% * 5 = 45% of its total capacity. The charge remaining was <fact3>28%</fact3>, so before losing the 21% and 45%, the charge was 28% + 21% + 45% = 94%. Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

Before gathering, Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>, which was <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>. Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>. How many did each person get?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Since Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>, Carlos collected 2x seashells. Jim collected <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>, so Jim collected 2x + <fact2>5</fact2> seashells. But we know that Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>, so we can set up the equation 2x + <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact1>27</fact1>. Solving for x, we get x = (<fact1>27</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2>) / 2 = 11. So Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2x = 22 seashells, and Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>. Since they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person got (11 + 22 + <fact1>27</fact1>) / 3 = 20 seashells."

Answer: 
Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house will be the selling price of the house minus the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount. The transfer fees are <fact1>3% of the selling price</fact1>, which is <fact1>3%</fact1> * <fact3>$400 000</fact3> = $12 000. The brokerage fee is <fact2>5% of the selling price</fact2>, which is <fact2>5%</fact2> * <fact3>$400 000</fact3> = $20 000. The total fees paid are $12 000 + $20 000 = $32 000. Mr. Tan also paid <fact4>$250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house</fact4>. Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are <fact3>$400 000</fact3> - $32 000 - <fact4>$250 000</fact4> = $118 000. The answer is {118000}."

Answer: 
Since Chikote howls for <fact1>twice as long as Tobias</fact1>, and <fact3>each of Tobias' howls lasts for 20 seconds</fact3>, Chikote's howls last for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

He also picks out a pair of shorts for <fact4>$35</fact4>. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs <fact2>$25</fact2>, and there is a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3>. So the discount is <fact2>$25</fact2> * <fact3>30%</fact3> = <fact2>$25</fact2> * 0.3 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is <fact2>$25</fact2> - $7.50 = $17.50. The total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + <fact4>$35</fact4> = $52.50. Since Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1>, he will not have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $52.50 - <fact1>$50</fact1> = $2.50. The answer is -2.50"

Answer: 
Sheila initially charged <fact1>$85.00 worth of merchandise</fact1> on her credit card. After returning an item that cost <fact4>$15.00</fact4>, her balance became <fact1>$85.00</fact1> - <fact4>$15.00</fact4> = $70.00.

He edits an <fact4>equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers</fact4>, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Answer: 
Since Mark edits an <fact4>equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers</fact4>, he edits <fact1>1000 sentences each week</fact1> / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. For <fact2>Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence</fact2>, so he earns 500 * <fact2>5 cents</fact2> = 2500 cents from Publisher A. Since <fact3>Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays</fact3>, Publisher B pays 2 * <fact2>5 cents</fact2> = 10 cents per sentence.

The Go-karts cost <fact4>$10 a ride</fact4>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Morgan has a budget of <fact1>$90</fact1> for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf with her friends, which costs <fact2>$5</fact2> per person. She also wants to give each friend <fact3>$5 in arcade tokens</fact3>. Additionally, she wants to ride the go-karts twice with each friend, which costs <fact4>$10</fact4> per ride, so <fact4>$10</fact4> * 2 = $20 per person for the go-karts. The total cost per person is <fact2>$5</fact2> + <fact3>$5</fact3> + $20 = $30. Since Morgan also wants to participate in these activities, she needs to include her own cost in the total. Her total cost will be $30 (her cost) + $30x (her friends' cost) = <fact1>$90</fact1>. Solving for x, we get $30 + $30x = <fact1>$90</fact1> => $30x = <fact1>$90</fact1> - $30 => $30x = $60 => x = $60/$30 => x = 2. The answer is {2}."

Answer: 
To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact2>5% of the selling price</fact2>, which is <fact1>$350,000</fact1> x 0.05 = $17,500. The transfer fee is <fact3>12% of the selling price</fact3>, which is <fact1>$350,000</fact1> x 0.12 = $42,000. The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee: <fact1>$350,000</fact1> + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500. To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's <fact4>$400,000 budget</fact4>, we subtract the budget from the total price: $409,500 - <fact4>$400,000</fact4> = $9,500.

She wrote <fact3>5 articles on Monday</fact3> and <fact4>2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact4>. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.

Answer: 
To find the total hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to find out how many articles she wrote in total, then multiply by the time it takes to write each article, which is <fact1>4 hours</fact1>. We know she wrote <fact3>5 articles on Monday</fact3>. We also know she wrote <fact4>2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact4>, so she wrote 5 * 2/5 = 2 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Since she wrote 5 articles on Monday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote <fact2>twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact2>, so she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes <fact1>4 hours</fact1> to write, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing articles in the three days. The answer is {104}."

Answer: 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by all students. We know that Adam has <fact1>50 points</fact1>. Betty collected <fact4>30% more</fact4> than Adam, so she has 50 + 50 * 0.3 = 65 points. Tom has <fact3>30 points less than Betty</fact3>, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points. Marta collected <fact2>3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points. The total points collected by all students is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

Initially, Bob had <fact5>4 white fish</fact5> and <fact4>3 orange fish</fact4> in his pond. So, after adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is x + <fact5>4</fact5> and the total number of orange fish is y + <fact4>3</fact4>. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation: y + <fact4>3</fact4> = 2(x + <fact5>4</fact5>). We can simplify this equation to y + 3 = 2x + 8, and then y = 2x + 5. Now we can substitute y = 2x + 5 into the first equation x + y = <fact1>17</fact1> to get x + 2x + 5 = 17. Solving for x, we get 3x = 12, so x = 4. Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. The answer is {4}."
72,"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?","Reformatted Question: 
Two years ago, Leo had <fact1>100 stickers</fact1> in his collection. This year, he collected <fact2>twice the number of stickers as the previous year</fact2>. Last year, Leo collected <fact3>50 stickers</fact3>. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?

Answer: 
To determine how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we first need to calculate how many stickers he collected this year. We know that this year, he collected <fact2>twice the number of stickers as the previous year</fact2>, and last year he collected <fact3>50 stickers</fact3>. Therefore, this year he collected 2 x <fact3>50 stickers</fact3> = 100 stickers. We also know that two years ago, Leo had <fact1>100 stickers</fact1> in his collection. So, to find the total number of stickers in his collection, we need to add the number of stickers he had two years ago to the number of stickers he collected last year and this year. Therefore, the total number of stickers in his collection is <fact1>100 stickers</fact1> + <fact3>50 stickers</fact3> + 100 stickers = 250 stickers. The answer is {250}."
73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Reformatted Question: 
A toy manufacturer receives an order for <fact1>400 toys</fact1>. <fact2>5 workers</fact2> are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another <fact4>20 toys</fact4> to be able to ship the order. <fact5>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, and another <fact6>2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate how many toys the first 4 workers produce in total during their shift. The <fact5>2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour</fact5> produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. The <fact6>2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour</fact6> produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the first 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. Since they work for <fact3>10 hours</fact3>, they produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys in total.

Now, we know that the manufacturer still needs <fact4>20 toys</fact4> to complete the order of <fact1>400 toys</fact1>. This means that all <fact2>5 workers</fact2> together have produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys during their shift. We also know that the first 4 workers produced 200 toys. So, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys during the <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (180) by the number of hours worked (<fact3>10 hours</fact3>). This gives us 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

The answer is {18}."

After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

Answer: 
The final price of Stephen's groceries can be calculated by first adding the tip to the final bill. This gives us <fact1>$40.00</fact1> + <fact2>$4.00</fact2> = $44.00. Then, we need to calculate the 25% fee, which is <fact3>25%</fact3> of $44.00. This is equal to 0.25 * $44.00 = $11.00. Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fees to the total. This gives us $44.00 + $11.00 + <fact4>$3.00</fact4> = $58.00. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.00."

How far off was his guess?

Answer: 
To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar, which is <fact5>6 inches</fact5> * <fact5>6 inches</fact5> * <fact6>15 inches</fact6> = 540 cubic inches. Because a jelly bean is <fact2>.15 cubic inches</fact2>, the jar can hold 540 / <fact2>.15</fact2> = 3600 jelly beans if it is packed perfectly. However, because the jar is only packed with <fact3>80% efficiency</fact3>, it can hold 3600 * <fact3>.8</fact3> = 2880 jelly beans. Because only <fact4>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact4>, the jar holds 2880 * <fact4>.3</fact4> = 864 jelly beans. This is <fact7>900</fact7> - 864 = 36 less than the true number of red jelly beans. The answer is {36}."

Answer: 
To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time it took John to drive to his friend's house and the time it took him to drive back home. The distance to his friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5> + <fact2>10 miles</fact2> = 210 miles. The time it took him to drive to his friend's house is 210 miles / <fact1>70 mph</fact1> = 3 hours. The time it took him to drive back home is <fact3>240 miles</fact3> / <fact4>80 mph</fact4> = 3 hours. Therefore, the total time of the trip is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours. The answer is {6}."

If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","Reformatted Question: 
Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The <fact1>tattered jeans cost $28</fact1> while the <fact2>jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans</fact2>. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He <fact3>saved a total of $6</fact3>. If he <fact4>saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4> and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Answer: 
First, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the <fact2>jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans</fact2> and the <fact1>tattered jeans cost $28</fact1>, the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $6 = $22. However, we need to find the amount saved from each type of jeans. Since Cole <fact3>saved a total of $6</fact3> and <fact4>saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4>, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans. So the tattered jeans were originally priced at $28 + $4 = $32, but this is not what we are looking for. We want to know how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans before any discounts. However, we found that the jogger jeans were originally $22 and the tattered jeans were $28 before any discounts, meaning the jogger jeans were actually less than the tattered jeans. Thus, to answer the question, the jogger jeans were $28 - $22 = $6 less than the tattered jeans originally. Since we were asked for how much more the jogger jeans cost, the answer is the negative of this value, -$6, but we will just say the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans originally."

John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth <fact1>40% of his house</fact1>.  He uses <fact2>60% of that</fact2> to pay off his debts.  His house is worth <fact3>$250,000</fact3>. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?

Answer: 
To determine how much money John had leftover after paying debt, we need to calculate how much money he received from the loan and how much he used to pay off his debts. Since his house is worth <fact3>$250,000</fact3>, and he gets a loan worth <fact1>40% of his house</fact1>, he will receive 0.4 * <fact3>$250,000</fact3> = $100,000. He uses <fact2>60% of that</fact2> to pay off his debts, which is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000. Thus, the amount of money he has leftover after paying debt is $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000. The answer is {40000}."

The room will warm up at <fact6>2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running</fact6>. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

Answer: 
The air conditioner cools the room <fact4>2 degrees an hour on low</fact4> and it ran on low for <fact1>3 hours</fact1>, so it cooled the room <fact4>2 degrees/hour</fact4> * <fact1>3 hours</fact1> = 6 degrees. Then it was turned up to high for <fact2>4 hours</fact2> and cools the room <fact5>3 degrees an hour on high</fact5>, so it cooled the room <fact5>3 degrees/hour</fact5> * <fact2>4 hours</fact2> = 12 degrees. So, after running on low and high, the room was cooled 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. Afterward, it was turned off for <fact3>2 hours</fact3> and the room will warm up at <fact6>2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running</fact6>, so the room warmed up <fact6>2 degrees/hour</fact6> * <fact3>2 hours</fact3> = 4 degrees.

If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of cups Millie can sell. Since she can make <fact3>3 pitchers of lemonade</fact3> and each <fact1>pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade</fact1>, she can make a total of <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>12</fact1> = 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each <fact4>cup of lemonade for $1</fact4>, she can make a total of 36 * <fact4>$1</fact4> = $36. Since she spends <fact2>$18 to buy enough supplies</fact2>, her total profit will be $36 - <fact2>$18</fact2> = $18. To find her profit per hour, we need to divide her total profit by the number of hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of <fact5>4 cups per hour</fact5>, it will take her 36 / <fact5>4</fact5> = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade. Therefore, her profit per hour will be $18 / 9 = $2.

Answer: Frankie watched a total of <fact6>7 hours of TV</fact6>, which is equivalent to 7 * 60 = 420 minutes. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a total of 2 * <fact2>1-hour episodes</fact2> = 2 hours = 120 minutes. On Thursday, he watched a <fact3>1-hour episode</fact3> and a <fact4>30-minute show</fact4>, which is a total of 90 minutes. On Friday, he watched two <fact5>1-hour episodes</fact5>, which is a total of 120 minutes. So, the total time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 120 + 90 + 120 = 330 minutes. This means that on Wednesday, Frankie watched 420 - 330 = 90 minutes of TV. Since each episode is <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> long, Frankie watched 90 / 30 = 3 episodes on Wednesday. The answer is {3}."

Each <fact4>student earns the same amount</fact4>.  How much did each student raise?

Answer: To find out how much each student raised, we need to first find out how much the students raised in total. We know that the charity raised a total of <fact1>$175,000</fact1> and that <fact2>$50,000 came from organizations</fact2>. So, the amount raised by the students is <fact1>$175,000</fact1> - <fact2>$50,000</fact2> = $125,000. Since there are 20 students and <fact4>each student earns the same amount</fact4>, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. Therefore, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250."

Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. Bernadette wants to arrive <fact1>5 minutes before Wayne</fact1>. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes <fact2>four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</fact2>. If it takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?

Answer: 
Since Bernadette wants to arrive <fact1>5 minutes before Wayne</fact1> and it takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater in <fact3>4</fact3> - <fact1>5</fact1> = -1 minute, relative to Wayne's arrival time. However, this is not the question being asked. Instead, we want to know how much earlier Bernadette should leave. Since it takes <fact2>four times as long</fact2> for Bernadette to drive to the theater compared to Wayne, it will take Bernadette <fact2>four times</fact2> * <fact3>four minutes</fact3> = 16 minutes to drive to the theater. Since Wayne takes <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, Bernadette needs to leave 16 - <fact3>4</fact3> = 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the same time as Wayne.

Answer: 
On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>20 White Oak trees</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees</fact4>, which is 2 * <fact3>20</fact3> = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted <fact1>10 more White Oak trees</fact1> than the first day, which is <fact3>20</fact3> + <fact1>10</fact1> = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted <fact2>1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees</fact2> than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the second day, he planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4> and he also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>.  How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer: 
John goes to work <fact1>5 days a week</fact1> for <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2>, so he goes to work a total of <fact1>5 days/week</fact1> * <fact2>50 weeks/year</fact2> = 250 days/year. Since he has to go to work and back, the total distance driven per day is <fact3>30 miles</fact3> * 2 = 60 miles. So, the total distance driven per year is 60 miles/day * 250 days/year = 15000 miles/year. He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4>, so the total cost per year for driving is 15000 miles/year * <fact4>$2/mile</fact4> = $30000/year. Additionally, he gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>, so the total bonus per year is <fact5>$150/month</fact5> * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by each player and add them together. The second player ate beef tips containing <fact1>8 beef tips, each an ounce in size</fact1>, so that is 8 ounces. The first player ate a <fact2>6-ounce steak</fact2>, so that is 6 ounces. The third player ate a <fact3>one-pound steak</fact3>, and since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat. Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 8 + 6 + 16 = 30 ounces. The answer is {30}."

So <fact1>5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated</fact1>, which is 5 x 2 = 10 tires. <fact2>3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated</fact2>, which is 3 x 3 = 9 tires. And <fact3>one person actually came by on a unicycle</fact3>, which is 1 tire. So in total, Shawnda inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Since <fact4>each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</fact4>, she earned 20 x 25 cents = 500 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, she earned 500 cents / 100 cents per dollar = $5. The answer is {5}."
108,"Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals. She feeds each of the chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Reformatted Question: Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals. She feeds each of the chickens <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1>, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens <fact2>15 cups of feed</fact2>.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another <fact3>25 cups of feed</fact3>.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is <fact4>20 chickens</fact4>?

Answer: To find the total number of cups Wendi needs to feed her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the cups of feed each chicken needs. Since there are <fact4>20 chickens</fact4> and each chicken needs <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1>, Wendi needs to feed her chickens a total of <fact4>20 chickens</fact4> * <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1> = 60 cups of feed. Since Wendi already gave her chickens <fact2>15 cups of feed</fact2> in the morning and <fact3>25 cups of feed</fact3> in the afternoon, she needs to give her chickens 60 - <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact3>25</fact3> = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is {20}."

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Reformatted Question: 
Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact1>. There's a <fact2>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</fact2>. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact3>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer: 
To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in and gives everyone an extension (40% chance)</fact1>, he won't have to turn it in. Additionally, if he has a <fact2>substitute teacher (50% chance)</fact2>, he also won't have to turn it in. However, if the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, Marcus still has a <fact3>20% chance of convincing the teacher for a personal extension</fact3>. 

First, let's find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in. The probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension is (1 - <fact2>0.5</fact2>) * (1 - <fact1>0.4</fact1>) = 0.3. Then, the probability that Marcus won't be able to convince the teacher for a personal extension is (1 - <fact3>0.2</fact3>) = 0.8. So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24.

Since there's a <fact2>50% chance of having a substitute teacher</fact2> and a 0% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework in that case, the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 0.24 * (1 - <fact2>0.5</fact2>) = 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12 or 12% + 0% * <fact2>0.5</fact2> =  0.12 or 12%."
112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted Question: 
Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each <fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>. A <fact2>small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. A <fact3>large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>. Lorraine starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact6>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact6> and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <fact7>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact7>. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: 
First, let's calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets from trading her large stickers. She trades <fact6>50% of her 40 large stickers</fact6>, which is 0.5 * <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5> = 20 large stickers. Since <fact1>each large sticker is worth a large button</fact1>, she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

Next, let's calculate how many small buttons Lorraine gets from trading the rest of her large stickers. She has <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5> - 20 large stickers = 20 large stickers left. Since <fact1>each large sticker is worth three small buttons</fact1>, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.

Now, let's calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets from trading her small stickers. She trades <fact7>90% of her 30 small stickers</fact7>, which is 0.9 * <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> = 27 small stickers. However, since she is trading these small stickers for large buttons, and <fact3>a large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>, she can trade 27 / 3 = 9 sets of 3 small stickers for 9 large buttons.

In total, Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers, 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers, and 9 large buttons from trading her small stickers, and 3 small stickers left that were not traded (<fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> - 27 small stickers = 3 small stickers), which she can trade for 3 small buttons since <fact2>a small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. Therefore, she has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

The answer is 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons."

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"Reformatted Question: 
<fact1>44 seniors</fact1> need to receive awards.  <fact2>2 of the seniors</fact2> will also receive pins that are <fact3>$5</fact3>.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs <fact4>$20</fact4>.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact5>20% cost per frame</fact5>.  <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers and they will need to receive cords that are <fact7>$12 each</fact7>.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each senior receives a picture frame, we need <fact1>44</fact1> frames. Each frame costs <fact4>$20</fact4> and needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact5>20% cost per frame</fact5>. So, the total cost per frame is <fact4>$20</fact4> + <fact4>$20</fact4> * <fact5>20%</fact5> = $24. The total cost of the frames is <fact1>44</fact1> * $24 = $1056.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. Since <fact2>2 seniors</fact2> will receive pins, the total cost of the pins is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $10.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. Since <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers, we need to calculate 1/4 of <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> to find the number of officers. 1/4 of <fact1>44</fact1> is 11. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * <fact7>$12</fact7> = $132.

Finally, we add up the costs of the frames, pins, and cords to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts. The total amount is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198. The answer is {1198}."

Answer: 
Mike can write <fact1>a page every 6 minutes</fact1>, so he writes 60 minutes per hour / <fact1>6 minutes per page</fact1> = 10 pages per hour. He was a pen pal with <fact2>5 people</fact2>, but stopped being penpals with <fact3>2 of them</fact3>, so he has <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact3>2</fact3> = 3 penpals left. They each send <fact4>2 letters a week</fact4> that are <fact5>5 pages long</fact5>, and Mike responds in kind. So, Mike writes <fact4>2 letters</fact4> * <fact5>5 pages per letter</fact5> * 2 (for Mike's responses) = 20 pages per penpal per week. With 3 penpals, Mike writes 20 pages per penpal per week * 3 penpals = 60 pages per week. Since Mike writes 10 pages per hour, he spends 60 pages per week / 10 pages per hour = 6 hours per week writing. The answer is {6}."

He has to be at the airport in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?

Answer: To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we first need to calculate how long it will take him to read the book. The book is <fact1>45 pages long</fact1> and averages <fact2>200 words a page</fact2>, so the total number of words in the book is <fact1>45 pages</fact1> * <fact2>200 words per page</fact2> = 9000 words. Toby can read at a rate of <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3>, so it will take him 9000 words / <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3> = 30 minutes to read the book. Since it takes <fact4>10 minutes to get to the airport</fact4>, Toby will need 30 minutes to read the book + <fact4>10 minutes to get to the airport</fact4> = 40 minutes in total. He has to be at the airport in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>, so he will be <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early. The answer is {20}."

Calculate how much he got in refunds.

Answer: 
To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. Since <fact1>2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased</fact1> had passed the expiry date, we can calculate the amount of sour milk as <fact2>4000 gallons of milk</fact2> * <fact1>2/5</fact1> = 1600 gallons. 

Now, we can calculate the refund amount by multiplying the amount of sour milk by the cost per gallon, which is <fact3>$3.5 per gallon</fact3>. Therefore, the refund amount is 1600 gallons * <fact3>$3.5 per gallon</fact3> = $5600. The answer is {5600}."

(Round to the nearest integer.)

Answer: 
To find the cost per serving, we need to find the total cost of the soup and then divide it by the number of people it serves. Antoine's recipe calls for <fact1>2 pounds of onions</fact1>, but he likes to <fact2>double that amount</fact2>, so he will need 2 * <fact1>2 pounds of onions</fact1> = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for <fact3>$2.00 a pound</fact3>, so the total cost of onions will be 4 pounds * <fact3>$2.00 a pound</fact3> = $8.00. Antoine also needs <fact5>2 boxes of beef stock</fact5>, which are on sale for <fact6>$2.00 a box</fact6>, so the total cost of beef stock will be <fact5>2 boxes of beef stock</fact5> * <fact6>$2.00 a box</fact6> = $4.00. The total cost of the soup will be $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00. Since the soup serves <fact4>6 people</fact4>, the cost per serving will be $12.00 / <fact4>6 people</fact4> = $2.00. The answer is {2}."

It also takes <fact7>2 pounds of special honey</fact7>. How much profit does he make selling <fact8>10 jars</fact8>?

Answer: 
To calculate the profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making 10 jars and subtract it from the total revenue. The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is <fact5>2 pounds per jar</fact5> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact1>$6 per pound</fact1> = $120. The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is <fact6>1.5 pounds per jar</fact6> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact2>$8 per pound</fact2> = $120. The cost of honey for 10 jars is <fact7>2 pounds per jar</fact7> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact3>$10 per pound</fact3> = $200. The total cost is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are <fact3>twice as many more dogs than when he left</fact3> so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, <fact4>3 dogs were gone</fact4> so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs <fact5>one toy</fact5>. How many toys in total does James need?

Answer: 
James initially had <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> and bought toys for the additional <fact2>8 dogs</fact2>, so he had a total of <fact1>4</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2> = 12 dogs. After buying the toys and returning to the shelter, he found that there were <fact3>twice as many more dogs than when he left</fact3>. This means there were 12 * 2 = 24 dogs in the shelter now. Since James already had toys for the initial 12 dogs, he needed to buy toys for the additional 24 - 12 = 12 dogs. When James came back yet again, <fact4>3 dogs were gone</fact4>, so he no longer needed those toys. Thus, James needed toys for a total of 12 + 12 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since each dog needs <fact5>one toy</fact5>, James needs 21 toys in total. The answer is {21}."

129,Tom plants 10 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?,"Reformatted Question: Tom plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1>. He starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2>. After <fact3>10 years</fact3>, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>. Every year he also chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5>. How many trees does he have left?

Answer: Tom starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2> and plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, so he has 50 + 10 * 10 = 150 trees. However, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>, which is 0.3 * 150 = 45 trees. So, he has 150 - 45 = 105 trees left. Additionally, he chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, which is 2 * 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he has 105 - 20 = 85 trees left. The answer is {85}."
130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","Reformatted Question: 
Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact2>. He has <fact3>55 goats in Farm X</fact3> and <fact4>45 goats in Farm Y</fact4>. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?

Answer: 
To find the number of goats left in the two farms altogether, we first need to determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm. We know that he sold <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact2>. This means that he sold 2 * <fact1>10</fact1> = 20 goats from Farm Y. 

Initially, Mr. Smith had <fact3>55 goats in Farm X</fact3> and <fact4>45 goats in Farm Y</fact4>. After selling the goats, he had <fact3>55</fact3> - <fact1>10</fact1> = 45 goats left in Farm X. For Farm Y, he had <fact4>45</fact4> - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 + 25 = 70. The answer is {70}."

John cuts down an <fact1>80-foot tree</fact1>.  He cuts it into <fact2>4-foot logs</fact2>.  He sells planks for <fact3>$1.2 each</fact3>. He can make logs out of <fact4>80% of the tree</fact4>. From each of those logs, he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5>.  How much does he make?

Answer: 
John can make logs out of <fact4>80% of the tree</fact4>, which is <fact4>80%</fact4> * <fact1>80 feet</fact1> = 64 feet. Since he cuts the tree into <fact2>4-foot logs</fact2>, he can make 64 feet / <fact2>4 feet per log</fact2> = 16 logs. From each of those logs, he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5>, so he can make 16 logs * <fact5>5 planks per log</fact5> = 80 planks.

132,Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"Reformatted Question: 
Each muffaletta sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1> and would serve <fact2>4 people</fact2>.  Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. The <fact3>meat cost $7.00 per pound</fact3> and the <fact4>cheese cost $3.00 per pound</fact4>. There would be <fact5>20 people</fact5> in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>?

Answer: 
To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make to serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>. Since each sandwich serves <fact2>4 people</fact2>, he needs to make <fact5>20 people</fact5> / <fact2>4 people</fact2> per sandwich = 5 sandwiches. 

Since each sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>, he needs 5 sandwiches * <fact1>1 pound</fact1> of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat and 5 sandwiches * <fact1>1 pound</fact1> of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

The total cost of the meat is 5 pounds of meat * <fact3>$7.00 per pound</fact3> of meat = $35. The total cost of the cheese is 5 pounds of cheese * <fact4>$3.00 per pound</fact4> of cheese = $15.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $35 + $15 = $50. The answer is {50}."

Answer: 
Since Cole hid <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> and 1 dozen is 12, then Cole hid 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <fact3>2 less than Stacy</fact3>, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. So, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden in the yard. The answer is {9}."
134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","Reformatted Question: 
Each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>. Each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>. Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>. He wants to separate them into groups of <fact4>8</fact4> and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> and each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>, the total weight of the crayons is <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> * <fact1>1 ounce</fact1> = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of <fact4>8</fact4>, the number of boxes needed is <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> / <fact4>8 crayons per box</fact4> = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the boxes is then 25 boxes * <fact5>8 ounces per box</fact5> = 200 ounces.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by <fact2>16 ounces per pound</fact2>: 400 ounces / <fact2>16 ounces per pound</fact2> = 25 pounds.

The answer is {25}."

He also decided to buy himself a donut for <fact5>$2</fact5>. How much did everything cost?

Answer: 
A week has 7 days. So, Roger needs to buy <fact1>a week's worth of coffee</fact1> * <fact2>1 pound of coffee per day</fact2> = 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand costs <fact3>$5 per pound</fact3> * (1 + <fact4>20% more</fact4>) = $5 * 1.2 = $6 per pound. So, the coffee costs $6 per pound * 7 pounds = $42.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

Answer: 
To determine how many shirts Krissa ordered, we first need to find the number of students who need size small. Since <fact5>twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>, and <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>, then 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small. Next, we find the number of students who need size medium. Since <fact1>four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>, then 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium. Now, we find the number of students who need size large. Since <fact3>half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>, then 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large. Finally, we find the number of students who need size extra-large. Since <fact4>six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>, then 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large. To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add the number of students who need each size: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75. The answer is {75}."

Answer: 
Colby has already spent money on <fact1>5 movies on a Friday or Saturday</fact1> at <fact5>$10 per ticket</fact5> for a total of <fact1>5</fact1> x <fact5>$10</fact5> = $50.

He also wants to buy <fact10>a popcorn and a box of candy</fact10> on the last day of the month, which will cost him <fact7>$8</fact7> + <fact8>$2</fact8> = $10. Since it's a <fact9>Friday</fact9>, the ticket will cost him <fact5>$10</fact5>. The total amount he will spend on the last day is $10 + $10 = $20. Since his parents give him <fact11>$150 to spend at the movies</fact11> and he has already spent $130 and plans to spend $20 on the last day, he has $150 - $130 - $20 = $0 left to spend on additional movie tickets.

He decides to <fact7>upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00</fact7> which will add chips and a drink.   How much does he still owe?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the extras. The base burrito costs <fact2>$6.50</fact2>. The extras are: <fact3>$2.00 for extra meat</fact3>, <fact4>$1.00 for extra cheese</fact4>, <fact5>$1.00 for avocado</fact5>, and 2 x <fact6>$0.25 for sauces</fact6> = $0.50. The total cost of the extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. The upgrade costs <fact7>$3.00</fact7>. The total cost of the meal is <fact2>$6.50</fact2> + $4.50 + <fact7>$3.00</fact7> = $14.00. Chad has a gift card for <fact1>$5.00</fact1>, so he still owes $14.00 - <fact1>$5.00</fact1> = $9.00.

Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the <fact1>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and the <fact2>same amount of salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar each time</fact3>. She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer: 
Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x. Since Tanya uses the <fact1>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1>, they both are equal to x. The amount of salt and sugar is <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>, so it is 2x. The amount of oil is <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4>, so it is 2(2x) = 4x. The total amount of the mixture is <fact3>10 ounces</fact3>, so x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. This simplifies to 10x = 10, so x = 1. Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1 = 4 ounces.

The carnations will use <fact4>1.5 pounds per carnation</fact4> * <fact6>10 carnations</fact6> = 15 pounds of soil. So, the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. This leaves <fact1>30 pounds</fact1> - 27 pounds = 3 pounds of soil for the roses.

Answer: 
First, we need to determine how many people are attending the party. We know that Kayla invited <fact1>25 classmates</fact1>, <fact2>7 girls in her dance class</fact2>, and <fact3>13 family members</fact3>. So, the total number of people invited is <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 45. However, <fact4>4 people said they could not come</fact4>, so the total number of people attending the party is 45 - 4 = 41. 

The fee to rent the theater is <fact5>$125 for a party of 20</fact5>, and there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. Since the fee is <fact6>$6 for each additional guest</fact6>, the total additional cost is 21 * <fact6>$6</fact6> = $126.

146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"Reformatted Question: 
Crista's plants need to be watered every day. <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>. She has <fact2>20 plants</fact2>. <fact3>4 of her plants need half of a cup of water</fact3>. The rest need <fact4>a quarter of a cup of water</fact4>. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?

Answer: 
First, let's calculate how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Since Crista has <fact2>20 plants</fact2> and <fact3>4 of her plants need half of a cup of water</fact3>, the rest of the plants is <fact2>20</fact2> - <fact3>4</fact3> = 16 plants. But we also know that <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>, so the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 16 - <fact1>8</fact1> = 8 plants. Now, the total amount of water needed for the plants that need 1 cup of water is <fact1>8 plants</fact1> * 1 cup = 8 cups. The total amount of water needed for the plants that need half of a cup of water is <fact3>4 plants</fact3> * 0.5 cup = 2 cups. The total amount of water needed for the plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 8 plants * <fact4>0.25 cup</fact4> = 2 cups. Therefore, Crista needs 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants. The answer is {12}."
148,"Caroline has 4 children. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. The first child is 6 feet tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.

Caroline has 4 children. The <fact1>second child is two inches taller than the first child</fact1>. The <fact2>first child is 6 feet tall</fact2>. The <fact3>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact3>.  And the <fact4>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact4>.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?

Answer: 
First, we need to find the height of the first child in inches. Since the <fact2>first child is 6 feet tall</fact2> and there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall. 

Since the <fact1>second child is two inches taller than the first child</fact1>, the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The <fact3>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact3>, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

Finally, the <fact4>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact4>, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The answer is {72}."

Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. In one month, Marcel sold a total of <fact1>300 bikes</fact1> among the types listed. <fact2>Half of them were Trekking bikes</fact2>, and <fact3>15% were BMX bikes</fact3>. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is <fact4>$500</fact4>, BMX is <fact5>half the price of an MTB</fact5>, and a Trekking bike is <fact6>$450</fact6>. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Answer: 
To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to know how many of each type of bike he sold and multiply that by the price of each bike. We know that <fact2>half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes</fact2>, so he sold <fact1>300</fact1> / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes. We also know that <fact3>15% of the bikes were BMX bikes</fact3>, so he sold <fact1>300</fact1> * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, he sold <fact1>300</fact1> - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes. Now we can calculate the total earnings. 105 MTB bikes at <fact4>$500</fact4> each is 105 x <fact4>$500</fact4> = $52,500. 45 BMX bikes at <fact5>half the price of an MTB</fact5> (<fact4>$500</fact4> / 2 = $250) is 45 x $250 = $11,250. 150 Trekking bikes at <fact6>$450</fact6> each is 150 x <fact6>$450</fact6> = $67,500. Adding these together, we get $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250. The answer is {131250}."

Dean bought <fact4>6 toy cars</fact4> and <fact5>5 teddy bears</fact5>. His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra <fact6>$10</fact6>. How much money does Dean have left?

Answer: 
To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate how much he spent on toy cars and teddy bears. The cost of the toy cars is <fact2>$2</fact2> * <fact4>6 toy cars</fact4> = $12. The cost of the teddy bears is <fact3>$1</fact3> * <fact5>5 teddy bears</fact5> = $5. So, in total, Dean spent $12 + $5 = $17. He was initially given <fact1>$28</fact1>, and then received an extra <fact6>$10</fact6>, so he had a total of $28 + $10 = $38. After spending $17, he is left with $38 - $17 = $21.

Answer: 
Since one <fact6>banana costs twice as much</fact6> as one <fact5>apple costs $0.5</fact5>, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1. Since <fact4>oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece</fact4>, the price of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>?

Answer: 
A normal student has <fact1>6 periods in a day</fact1>, but John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods in a day. Since each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>, John spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class. Additionally, he spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, we need to first calculate the total weekly minutes spent in class, which is 1600 minutes. Then, we can calculate the extra learning time: 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes, and since this is spent on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply by 2 to get 200 minutes. So, the total weekly minutes spent learning is 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1800 / 60 = 30 hours. The answer is {30}."

How many bandages did they start with on the first day?

Answer: 
Let's start with the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day, which is <fact7>78 bandages</fact7>. On the third day, they ordered <fact2>two bulk packs of bandages</fact2>, which is 2 * <fact1>50 bandages</fact1> = 100 bandages. They also used <fact3>half a pack</fact3>, which is 0.5 * <fact1>50 bandages</fact1> = 25 bandages. So, at the beginning of the third day, they had 78 + 25 - 100 = 3 bandages. 

On the second day, they used <fact4>ten fewer bandages</fact4> compared to the first day, which means they used <fact5>38 bandages</fact5> - 10 = 28 bandages. 

On the first day, they used <fact5>38 bandages</fact5> and ordered <fact6>one bulk pack of bandages</fact6>, which is 1 * <fact1>50 bandages</fact1> = 50 bandages. 

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as x. Then, at the end of the first day, they had x - <fact5>38 bandages</fact5> + <fact6>one bulk pack of bandages</fact6> = x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages. 

On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so at the end of the second day, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages. 

At the beginning of the third day, they had x - 16 bandages, and we know that this number is equal to 3 (from the calculation above). Therefore, x - 16 = 3, which means x = 19. 

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day."

If Tim can ride his skateboard at <fact4>264 feet per minute</fact4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: 
To determine who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home. Since <fact1>Tim lives 2 miles away from the school</fact1> and there are 5280 feet in a mile, Tim lives 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet away from school. Similarly, since <fact2>Steve lives 3 miles from the school</fact2>, Steve lives 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet away from school. Given that <fact3>Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute</fact3>, it will take Steve 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes to get home. Given that <fact4>Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</fact4>, it will take Tim 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to get home. Since Steve's time (36 minutes) is less than Tim's time (40 minutes), Steve will win the race. To find the waiting time, we subtract the winner's time from the loser's time. Therefore, Steve will be waiting for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes. The answer is {4}."

The shore was <fact3>sixty-four seconds away</fact3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?

Answer: To find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to first find out how far she had to row to get to shore. Since it takes Julia <fact1>sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</fact1>, we can find her rowing speed as 20 feet / <fact1>16 seconds</fact1> = 1.25 feet/second. The shore was <fact3>64 seconds away</fact3>, so she had to row 1.25 feet/second * <fact3>64 seconds</fact3> = 80 feet. The boat was taking on <fact2>2 liters of water for every 10 feet</fact2> she rowed back towards shore.

How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","Reformatted Question: 
A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had <fact1>four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day</fact1>. They dug <fact2>ten holes the first day</fact2>, <fact3>thirteen holes the second day</fact3>, and <fact4>eight holes the third day</fact4>. On the <fact5>fourth day of digging</fact5>, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the <fact6>third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in</fact6>. How many holes did the pirates dig on the <fact7>fourth day before finding the treasure</fact7>?

Answer: 
Since the island had <fact1>four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day</fact1>, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is <fact1>four times</fact1> the number of holes at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were <fact2>ten holes</fact2>. On the second day, <fact3>thirteen holes</fact3> were dug, and on the third day, <fact4>eight holes</fact4> were dug. However, on the <fact6>third day, two holes were filled in</fact6>, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is <fact2>10</fact2> + <fact3>13</fact3> + <fact4>8</fact4> - 2 = 29. On the <fact5>fourth day</fact5>, the total number of holes is <fact1>four times</fact1> the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact2>10</fact2> = 40. So, the number of holes dug on the <fact7>fourth day before finding the treasure</fact7> is 40 - 29 = 11. The answer is {11}."

How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Reformatted Question: 
Mr. Robles' first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>. Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2>, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for <fact3>a week</fact3>. The second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4> and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Answer: 
Since Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2> for <fact3>a week</fact3>, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten per day is <fact2>315 bananas</fact2> / 7 days = 45 bananas per day. The first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>. The second monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1> + <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4> = 14 bananas per day. The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day. The answer is {21}."

The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, but <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Answer: 
The solo song has <fact1>54 lines in the lyrics</fact1> that Sean needs to memorize. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, which is 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since <fact3>four-fifths of them are his</fact3>, Sean needs to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, which is 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>, so Sean needs to memorize 108 * 1/3 = 36 lines from the first scene. In total, Sean needs to memorize 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.

No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Reformatted Question: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone</fact1> and each hamster is given <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2>. The rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3> and each rat is given <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>. There is also a pen of rabbits where <fact5>20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</fact5>. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer: The total number of straws given to the hamsters is <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1> * <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw. The rabbits receive <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5>. So, the total number of straws given to the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw. Since <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, the rats must have received 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw. Since each rat receives <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4> and the rats are divided into <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3>, we can set up the equation: 6 * number of rats in each cage * 3 = 90. Solving for the number of rats in each cage, we get: number of rats in each cage = 90 / (6 * 3) = 5. The answer is {5}."

How fast does the faster car go?

Answer: 
To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We are told that the <fact3>2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car</fact3>, and the <fact1>average car can go 120 Miles per hour</fact1>. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 x <fact1>120 Miles per hour</fact1> = 600 Miles per hour. We are then told that the <fact2>fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car</fact2>. So, the speed of the fastest car is 1.25 x 600 Miles per hour = 750 Miles per hour. The answer is {750}."

Answer: 
To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then calculate his commission. The company paid <fact4>30% of the price</fact4> to acquire the cars, so the cost of acquiring each car is <fact3>$25,000</fact3> * <fact4>0.3</fact4> = $7,500. The profit from selling each car is <fact3>$25,000</fact3> - $7,500 = $17,500. Since James sold <fact2>10 cars</fact2>, the total profit is $17,500 * <fact2>10</fact2> = $175,000.

There will be <fact4>30 kids</fact4> and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have <fact5>4 jello cups</fact5>. How much will he spend on jello?

Answer: To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs to make. Since there will be <fact4>30 kids</fact4> and each kid will have <fact5>4 jello cups</fact5>, the total number of jello cups needed is <fact4>30</fact4> * <fact5>4</fact5> = 120 jello cups. 

Since a <fact2>three-ounce box of flavored jello</fact2> makes <fact3>10 small jello cups</fact3>, the total number of boxes needed is 120 / <fact3>10</fact3> = 12 boxes.

How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?

Answer: 
The total cost of the items before the discount is calculated as follows: 
- <fact1>Five notebooks</fact1> will cost <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact6>$1.50</fact6> = $7.50. 
- <fact2>Two pens</fact2> will cost <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact7>$0.25</fact7> = $0.50. 
- <fact3>One calculator</fact3> will cost <fact8>$12</fact8>. 
- <fact4>One geometry set</fact4> will cost <fact9>$10</fact9>. 
The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30. 
Since the shop gives a <fact5>10% discount</fact5> on all the purchased items, Daniel will get a discount of <fact5>10%</fact5> of $30, which is 0.10 * $30 = $3.

They will install additional items for an extra <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9>.   How much will this cost her?

Answer: The interior design firm's base offer includes hanging <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>, <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>, and <fact8>10 pictures</fact8> for <fact4>$129.00</fact4>. Angela has <fact1>6 mirrors</fact1>, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors installed. She also has <fact2>2 chandeliers</fact2>, so she needs 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier installed. Additionally, she has <fact3>20 pictures</fact3>, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures installed. In total, she needs 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items installed. Each additional item costs <fact9>$15.00</fact9>, so the total cost for the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00. The total cost for Angela will be the base price of <fact4>$129.00</fact4> plus the cost of the additional items, which is $195.00. Therefore, the total cost will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00. The answer is {324}."
185,"Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  The bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?","Reformatted Question: 
Tom has <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1> in his house. The living room is <fact2>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>. The rest of the house is <fact3>1000 square feet</fact3>. The bedrooms measure <fact4>20 by 12 feet each</fact4>. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?

Answer: 
To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the area of the rest of the house. The area of one bedroom is <fact4>20 by 12 feet</fact4>, which is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1>, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet. The living room is <fact2>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet. The rest of the house is <fact3>1000 square feet</fact3>. Therefore, the total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet. The answer is {3160}."

Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth <fact1>$400</fact1> and another pack worth <fact2>twice that much</fact2>.  He gets a <fact3>20% discount</fact3> on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs <fact4>$150</fact4>.  How much did he spend in total?

Answer: 
The first pack of fireworks costs <fact1>$400</fact1>. The second pack costs <fact2>twice that much</fact2>, so it costs 2 * <fact1>$400</fact1> = $800. The total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200. With a <fact3>20% discount</fact3>, the cost is reduced by 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. So the discounted cost of the two packs is $1200 - $240 = $960. Adding the finale firework that costs <fact4>$150</fact4>, the total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110. The answer is {1110}."

Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"Reformatted Question: 
John is a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has <fact1>1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact1>. Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class.  Ali's class has <fact2>a capacity of 120 students</fact2>. What is the combined capacity of both schools?

Answer: 
To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to find the capacity of John's school and Ali's school separately. We know that Ali's class has <fact2>a capacity of 120 students</fact2>. Since Ali teaches one class, the capacity of Ali's school is also 120 students. 

Now, we need to find the capacity of John's school. Each class in John's school has <fact1>1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact1>. Since Ali's class has <fact2>a capacity of 120 students</fact2>, each class in John's school has 120 * 1/8 = 15 students. John has two classes in his school, so the capacity of John's school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacities of John's school and Ali's school, which is 30 + 120 = 150 students. The answer is {150}."

She wanted to try something new, so she paid <fact5>half as much for a small pack of green apple gum</fact5>. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Answer: 
Since Suzie paid <fact5>half as much for the green apple gum</fact5> as she did for the grape gum, she paid <fact4>$2</fact4>/2 = $1 for the green apple gum. So far, she has spent <fact4>$2</fact4> + $1 = $3 on grape and green apple gum. She paid <fact2>$7 in all</fact2>, so she must have spent $7 - $3 = $4 on strawberry gum.

189,"Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  In total, he bought 3 packs for $1800 each. How much money profit did he make?","Reformatted Question: 
Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He gets <fact1>1 card that is worth $4000</fact1> and another card worth <fact2>$1000</fact2>.  There are <fact3>30 more cards worth an average of $50 each</fact3>.  In total, he bought <fact4>3 packs for $1800 each</fact4>. How much money profit did he make?

Answer: 
To calculate the profit, we need to find the total value of the cards and subtract the total cost of the packs. The total value of the cards is the sum of the values of the two rare cards and the 30 other cards. The value of the rare cards is <fact1>$4000</fact1> + <fact2>$1000</fact2> = $5000. The value of the other 30 cards is <fact3>30 cards * $50 per card</fact3> = $1500. So, the total value of the cards is $5000 + $1500 = $6500. The total cost of the packs is <fact4>3 packs * $1800 per pack</fact4> = $5400. Therefore, the profit is $6500 - $5400 = $1100. The answer is {1100}."

Answer: Elaine initially had <fact1>20 Pokemon cards</fact1>. After a month, she collected <fact2>three times that number</fact2>, which is 3 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected <fact4>20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact4>, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Answer: 
The first train arrives in <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> and stays for <fact3>20 minutes</fact3>, so it will leave after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes. The second train arrives <fact4>half an hour after the first train leaves</fact4>, so it will arrive 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The second train stays for <fact5>a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station</fact5>, which is <fact3>20</fact3>/4 = 5 minutes. So the second train will leave after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes. The third train arrives <fact7>an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact7>, so it will arrive 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. Since <fact8>the third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives</fact8>, it will leave at the same time, 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The fourth train, which is Paul's train, will arrive <fact6>20 minutes after the third train leaves</fact6>, so it will arrive 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The answer is {145}."

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?

Answer: 
To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days. On <fact2>Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs</fact2>. On both <fact1>Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday</fact1>, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs per day.

What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?

Answer: 
Since Jake buys <fact1>2 T-shirts</fact1> with a <fact2>buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts</fact2>, he pays full price for the first T-shirt and half price for the second T-shirt.

Of the people who receive a job offer, <fact2>a third of the people accept the position</fact2>. Of the people who receive interviews, <fact3>20% receive a job offer</fact3>. How many people accept the position?

Answer: 
To find out how many people accept the position, we first need to determine how many people receive interviews. We are given that <fact1>30% of the people who apply receive interviews</fact1>. Since 100 people applied, the number of people who receive interviews is 0.3 x 100 = 30. 

Next, we need to find out how many people receive a job offer. We are told that <fact3>20% of the people who receive interviews receive a job offer</fact3>. So, the number of people who receive a job offer is 0.2 x 30 = 6.

Finally, we need to calculate how many people accept the position. We know that <fact2>a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position</fact2>. Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 6 / 3 = 2.

James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>.  He swims <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2>. He can swim at a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how far James swam at his initial pace. Since he swam <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2> of the <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>, he swam 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>, it took him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim that distance. After that, he rested for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. Now, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. Since he is going at <fact5>half the speed</fact5> of his initial pace, he is now swimming at 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, it will take him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. In total, it took James 6 hours to swim the initial distance, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. So, the total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours. The answer is {17}."

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for <fact4>$1.50</fact4> and <fact5>4 magnets</fact5> that were <fact6>$0.25 each</fact6>. Her parents gave her <fact7>$10</fact7> to buy whatever she wanted. How much money does Sally have left?

Answer: Sally bought <fact3>2 pounds</fact3> of taffy. The first pound cost <fact1>$3</fact1> and the second pound cost <fact1>$3</fact1> * <fact2>1/2</fact2> = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy was $3 + $1.50 = $4.50. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for <fact4>$1.50</fact4> and <fact5>4 magnets</fact5> that were <fact6>$0.25 each</fact6>, so the total cost of the magnets was <fact5>4</fact5> * <fact6>$0.25</fact6> = $1. The total amount she spent was $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7. Her parents gave her <fact7>$10</fact7> to buy whatever she wanted. So she has <fact7>$10</fact7> - $7 = $3 left. The answer is {3}."
203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Reformatted Question: 
Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a <fact1>flat fee of $200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5 for each person</fact3> who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of guests as x. The cost of the first venue is the flat fee of <fact1>$200</fact1> plus the cost of food, which is <fact3>$5 per person</fact3> times the number of guests (x). So, the total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> times the number of guests (x), which is 25x. To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other: 200 + 5x = 25x. Subtracting 5x from both sides gives 200 = 20x. Dividing both sides by 20 gives x = 10. Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost. The answer is {10}."

If the farmer and the truck driver put in a <fact3>6 hour day</fact3>, how many bales of hay are left in the field?

Answer: In a <fact3>6 hour day</fact3>, the farmer will produce <fact2>5 bales</fact2> * <fact3>6 hours</fact3> = 30 bales of hay. In a <fact3>6 hour day</fact3>, the truck will pick up <fact1>3 bales</fact1> * <fact3>6 hours</fact3> = 18 bales of hay. Thus, there will be 30 - 18 = 12 bales of hay left in the field.

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Reformatted Question: Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>. He retrieved <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>. In the <fact3>first of three sets</fact3>, he had to retrieve <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the <fact3>first set of the match</fact3>?

Answer: Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. In the third set, Rory retrieved <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>, so he retrieved x/2 balls. In the first set, he retrieved <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>, so he retrieved x + 4 balls. The total number of balls retrieved is <fact2>19</fact2>, so we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x + 8 = 38. Combining like terms, we get 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 6. Since x is the number of balls retrieved in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10. The answer is {10}."

Maria invited <fact1>4 of her friends</fact1> over for a water balloon fight in the backyard. At the start of the game, Maria had <fact2>one water balloon for herself</fact2>. Then her mom came out and gave <fact3>each person 3 more balloons</fact3>.  At the start of the game, Maria gave <fact4>each of her friends 2 water balloons</fact4>. How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?

Answer: 
There are a total of <fact1>4 friends</fact1> + 1 (Maria) = 5 people playing the game. Maria initially had <fact2>1 water balloon</fact2>. Her mom then gave <fact3>3 more balloons to each person</fact3>, so 5 x <fact3>3 more balloons</fact3> = 15 more balloons were added. Maria also gave <fact4>2 water balloons to each of her friends</fact4>, so <fact1>4 friends</fact1> x <fact4>2 water balloons</fact4> = 8 more balloons were added. However, these 8 balloons were already counted in the initial number of balloons given by Maria's mom, so they should not be counted again. Therefore, the total number of balloons is <fact2>1 (Maria's initial balloon)</fact2> + 15 (additional balloons given by Maria's mom) + 8 (balloons given by Maria to her friends, which were already included in the 15) = 1 + 15 = 16 (initial and additional balloons) + 8 (given to friends, but these were part of the 15) - but since the 8 are part of the 15, it is more accurate to just add 16 + 4 (4 friends * 2 balloons given by Maria) = 16 + 8 = 24. However, the correct way of looking at it is that there are 5 people and each got 3 more balloons from Maria's mom, and there was 1 balloon to start with and Maria gave 2 more balloons to each of her 4 friends, so we should just add the 8 to the 1 that Maria started with and the 15 that were given by her mom, but the 8 is already part of the 15, so the correct way of looking at it is that there are 5 people, and they each got 3 balloons, and there is 1 balloon to start with and 4 friends got 2 more, but again the 8 is part of the 15, so 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 and there was 1 to start with, and 8 more were given, but the 8 is part of the 15 so that would be double counting, so we should just look at the 5 people * 3 balloons and add the 1 balloon that Maria started with and that is the total number of balloons, except that that calculation does not include the 8 balloons that were given to the friends, but those 8 are part of the 15, so the correct way to calculate it is 5 * 3 + 1 + 4 * 2 = 24 or 5 * 3 + 1 + 8 = 24 but again, since the 8 is part of the 15 that would be double counting, so we should just look at it as 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 plus 1 balloon and plus 8 more, but that 8 more is part of the 15, so we should just look at it as 5 * 3 and plus 1 and plus 4 * 2, but that 4 * 2 was part of the original 15, so that is not the correct way to calculate it, so we should just calculate it as 5 * 3 and plus 1 and plus 8, but that 8 is part of the original 15, so that would be double counting, so we should just look at it as 5 * 3 and plus 1, but that does not include the 8 that were given to the 4 friends, so we should just look at it as 5 * 3 + 1 + 4 * 2 = 24 or we can also look at it as 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 plus 1 balloon that Maria had and plus 8 more balloons that were given to the 4 friends, but again, since the 8 more balloons are part of the original 15, we should just look at it as 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 plus 1 balloon that Maria had, and plus 4 * 2 balloons that were given to the friends, so we should just look at it as 5 * 3 + "

How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Answer: 
To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent. They bought a cake for <fact1>$11</fact1> and <fact2>1 dozen balloons</fact2> which is equivalent to 12 balloons. Since the balloons were sold for <fact3>$0.5 for 2 balloons</fact3>, 12 balloons would cost (12/2) * <fact3>$0.5</fact3> = $3. They also bought <fact4>2 tubs of ice cream</fact4> for <fact5>$7 each</fact5>, so that's <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact5>$7</fact5> = $14. The total amount of money they spent is <fact1>$11</fact1> + $3 + $14 = $28.

If Sara <fact5>already had $10 saved before she started babysitting</fact5>, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs <fact1>$30</fact1> and two pairs of shoes cost 2 x <fact2>$20</fact2> = $40. So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70. Sara <fact5>already had $10 saved</fact5> and she earned 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting <fact4>4 times</fact4>. So, she has a total of $10 + $20 = $30. She still needs $70 - $30 = $40 to buy the jacket and shoes. Since her parents pay her <fact3>$4 each time she mows the lawn</fact3>, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Answer: 
In the <fact1>first year, the town will build 12 homes</fact1>. In the <fact3>second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year</fact3>, so they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes. By the end of the second year, they will have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes. In the <fact2>third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount</fact2>, so they will build 48 * 2 = 96 homes. However, this is the number of homes they will have built by the end of the second year doubled, not the number of new homes they will build in the third year. To find the number of new homes built in the third year, we need to subtract the number of homes already built from the total at the end of the third year.

The soup costs <fact3>25% more</fact3> than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + $4 * 0.25 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the dinner is $4 + $2 + $5 = $11. The answer is {11}."
220,"A large t-shirt is 6 square feet of fabric. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A medium t-shirt is 4 square feet of fabric. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?","Reformatted Question: 
A <fact1>large t-shirt is 6 square feet of fabric</fact1>. A <fact2>small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric</fact2>. Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A <fact3>medium t-shirt is 4 square feet of fabric</fact3>. If she uses <fact4>11 small shirts</fact4>, <fact5>8 medium</fact5>, and <fact6>6 large shirts</fact6>, how many square feet is the quilt?

Answer: 
The total area of the quilt can be calculated by adding the areas of the small, medium, and large t-shirts. The area of the small t-shirts is <fact2>3 square feet per small t-shirt</fact2> * <fact4>11 small t-shirts</fact4> = 33 square feet. The area of the medium t-shirts is <fact3>4 square feet per medium t-shirt</fact3> * <fact5>8 medium t-shirts</fact5> = 32 square feet. The area of the large t-shirts is <fact1>6 square feet per large t-shirt</fact1> * <fact6>6 large t-shirts</fact6> = 36 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the quilt is 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. The answer is {101}."
221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"Reformatted Question: 
Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps on the track in one hour</fact1>.  Quinn can run <fact2>2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</fact2>.  Shaelyn can run <fact3>half as many laps as Trey</fact3>.  Trey can run <fact4>4 more laps than Bethany</fact4>.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?

Answer: 
Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps in one hour</fact1>. Trey can run <fact4>4 more laps than Bethany</fact4>, so Trey can run <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact4>4</fact4> = 14 laps. Shaelyn can run <fact3>half as many laps as Trey</fact3>, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. Quinn can run <fact2>2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</fact2>, so Quinn can run 7 - <fact2>2</fact2> = 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run <fact1>10</fact1> - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. The answer is {5}."
222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"Reformatted Question: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A <fact1>2 x 4 costs $4</fact1>. A <fact2>2 x 8 costs $6</fact2>.  He can get <fact3>200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood</fact3> and <fact4>400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood</fact4>. He has <fact5>$24 to buy wood for sticks</fact5>. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer: To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to first determine which type of wood is the cheapest per stick. For the 2 x 4 wood, the cost per stick is <fact1>$4</fact1> / <fact3>200 sticks</fact3> = $0.02 per stick. For the 2 x 8 wood, the cost per stick is <fact2>$6</fact2> / <fact4>400 sticks</fact4> = $0.015 per stick. Since the 2 x 8 wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as he can with his <fact5>$24 budget</fact5>. He can buy <fact5>$24</fact5> / <fact2>$6</fact2> = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make 4 * <fact4>400 sticks</fact4> = 1600 sticks. The answer is {1600}."
223,"Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","Reformatted Question: Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a <fact1>case of 12 sodas</fact1> and shook <fact2>3 of them up</fact2>. Ellen's brother stopped by and took <fact3>1 of the shaken sodas</fact3> and <fact4>2 of the unshaken sodas</fact4>, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5> for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Answer: There were originally <fact2>3 shaken sodas</fact2> out of <fact1>12 total sodas</fact1>. Ellen's brother took <fact3>1 shaken soda</fact3> and <fact4>2 unshaken sodas</fact4>, leaving 3 - <fact3>1</fact3> = 2 shaken sodas and 9 - <fact4>2</fact4> = 7 unshaken sodas. Ellen then took <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5> for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 - <fact5>1</fact5> = 6 unshaken sodas. So, there are 2 shaken sodas out of 2 + 6 = 8 total sodas left. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is therefore 2/8 = 0.25, or 25%. The answer is {25}."
224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"Reformatted Question: 
Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> and she spits each one <fact2>10 feet</fact2>.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> she spits each one <fact4>12 feet</fact4>. What is the average total distance spat?

Answer: 
To find the average total distance spat, we need to first find the total distance spat by each person. Zoey spits <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 400 feet. Sydney spits <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> * <fact4>12 feet</fact4> = 420 feet. The total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet. To find the average, we divide the total distance by the number of people, which is 2. So, the average total distance spat is 820 / 2 = 410 feet. The answer is {410}."
225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reformatted Question: 
Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours <fact2>4 ounces of water</fact2> from the <fact3>33-degree mug</fact3> into his water bottle and <fact4>one ounce</fact4> from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Answer: 
To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the scenario where the final temperature of the mixed water is exactly <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>. Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When Donny pours <fact2>4 ounces of water</fact2> from the <fact3>33-degree mug</fact3> and <fact4>one ounce</fact4> from the second bottle, the total amount of water becomes 4 + 1 = 5 ounces. We can set up an equation based on the heat transfer:

(4 ounces * <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees. The answer is {68}."
226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Reformatted Question: Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>. Over the <fact2>third year it depreciated 20%</fact2>. Over the <fact3>first year it depreciated 30%</fact3>. The <fact4>second year it depreciated another 30%</fact4>. How much is the boat worth after the three years?

Answer: To calculate the boat's worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. In the <fact3>first year, the boat depreciated 30%</fact3>, so the boat's value after the first year is <fact1>$9000</fact1> * (1 - 0.3) = $6300. In the <fact4>second year, the boat depreciated another 30%</fact4>, so the boat's value after the second year is $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $4410. In the <fact2>third year, the boat depreciated 20%</fact2>, so the boat's value after the third year is $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $3528. The answer is {3528}."
227,"Each student in Marissa's class started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","Reformatted Question: 
Each student in Marissa's class started the year with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>. After two months, <fact2>1/5 of the total pencils in class</fact2> were used. At the end of the year, only <fact3>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact3> were left. There are <fact4>30 students</fact4> in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?

Answer: 
Since there are <fact4>30 students</fact4> in Marissa's class and each student started the year with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is <fact4>30 students</fact4> * <fact1>10 pencils</fact1> = 300 pencils. After two months, <fact2>1/5 of the total pencils in class</fact2> were used, which is 300 * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 60 pencils. So, the remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240 pencils. At the end of the year, only <fact3>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact3> were left, which is 240 * <fact3>1/3</fact3> = 80 pencils. The answer is {80}."
