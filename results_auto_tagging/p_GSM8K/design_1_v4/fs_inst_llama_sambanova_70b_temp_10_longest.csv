She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Reformatted Question: Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The <fact1>bids on the desk rise by $50 each time</fact1> and <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2>. She accepts the <fact3>opening bid of $200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer: Carmen accepted the <fact3>opening bid of $200</fact3>. After that, each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> bid once, so the bid rose by <fact1>$50</fact1> three times, for a total of <fact1>$50</fact1> * 3 = $150. Then Carmen bid and won, so the final price of the desk was <fact3>$200</fact3> + $150 = $350. The answer is {350}."

For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Reformatted Question: 
Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with <fact1>5 games</fact1> for his birthday.  For the <fact2>third year</fact2> he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>.  He saves up enough money to buy <fact5>1 game per month for a year</fact5>, and then the <fact6>second year</fact6> he starts buying <fact7>2 games a month</fact7>.  How many games does Steve have after <fact8>3 years</fact8>?

Answer: Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1>. For the first year, he buys <fact5>1 game per month</fact5> * 12 months = 12 games. For the second year, he buys <fact7>2 games a month</fact7> * 12 months = 24 games. For the third year, he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3> * 12 months = 48 games. He also gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>, so he gets 5 * 3 = 15 games. Therefore, Steve has <fact1>5</fact1> + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104 games. The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact2>a minute and a half</fact2> to peel a potato, but only about <fact3>5 seconds</fact3> to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer: To determine the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato and then multiply it by the total number of potatoes. It takes Billy <fact2>a minute and a half</fact2> to peel a potato, which is equivalent to 1.5 minutes. To convert this to seconds, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute), which gives us 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds. It also takes him <fact3>5 seconds</fact3> to cut it up. So, the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. Since Billy has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes: 95 * 60 = 5700 seconds. To convert this back to minutes, we divide by 60, which gives us 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes. The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>.  He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>.  Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>.  He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>.  How much money was he out?

Answer: James originally bought <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> at a price of <fact4>$15</fact4> per CD, but he got them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>. So the original price was <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> * <fact4>$15 per CD</fact4> = $150. But he got them for 40% off, so he paid $150 * (1 - 0.4) = $90. He sold <fact2>5 CDs</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>. So he was out $90 - $40 = $50. The answer is {50}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>18 seats</fact1> in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has <fact2>4 rows</fact2> of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer: There are <fact1>18 seats</fact1> in each row, and there are <fact2>4 rows</fact2> in the auditorium. So, there are <fact1>18</fact1> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 72 seats in total. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, which is 72/4 = 18 seats. The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, which is 54/3 = 18 seats. The rest of the seats were occupied by the students, which is 54 - 18 = 36 seats. The answer is {36}."
5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Reformatted Question: A bag of glass chips holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>.

If he has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer: Milo has <fact1>72 chips</fact1> * <fact4>2 bags</fact4> = 144 chips. Since it takes <fact3>12 chips</fact3> to make every square inch of the mosaic, he can make 144/<fact3>12</fact3> = 12 square inches of mosaic. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>3 inches tall</fact2>, he can make 12/<fact2>3</fact2> = 4 inches long. The answer is {4}."
6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Reformatted Question: Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The first needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>. On average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>. The third needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. How many miles does the last dog need?

Answer: To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we must first find the total miles walked by all the dogs. The average miles walked per dog is <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>, and there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>, so the total miles walked per day is <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3> * <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> = 12 miles per day. We know that the first dog walks <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second dog walks <fact4>4 miles</fact4>, and the third dog walks <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. So the first three dogs walk a total of <fact2>1 mile</fact2> + <fact4>4 miles</fact4> + <fact5>3 miles</fact5> = 8 miles. Therefore, the last dog must walk 12 miles per day - 8 miles = 4 miles. The answer is {4}."
7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","Reformatted Question: A perfume company is trying to create new scents.

They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?

Answer: To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to first calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. The total number of vanilla scents sold is <fact1>5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> * <fact3>4 vanilla scents</fact3> = 20. The total number of fruity scents sold is <fact2>2 of each of the fruity scents</fact2> * <fact4>8 fruity scents</fact4> = 16. Now, we can calculate how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents by subtracting the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4. The answer is {4}."

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","Reformatted Question: 
Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>.  His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot to remove the old carpet</fact2>, and <fact3>$34 per square foot to install the new carpet</fact3>.  The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer: 
To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we first need to find the area of the bedroom. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width: <fact1>18 feet</fact1> * <fact1>12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet. The cost of removing the old carpet is <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> * 216 square feet = $864. The cost of installing the new carpet is <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> * 216 square feet = $7344. The cost of the new carpet and padding is (<fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> + <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5>) * 216 square feet = ($14 per square foot) * 216 square feet = $3024. Therefore, the total cost of replacing the carpet is $864 + $7344 + $3024 = $11232. The answer is {11232}."
10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted Question: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers <fact2>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact2> and <fact3>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact3>. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of <fact4>500 apples</fact4>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer: Joanne gathered <fact1>30 apples</fact1> from the tallest trees. Half of this amount is <fact1>30</fact1>/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Joanne's sister gathered <fact2>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact2>, which is <fact1>30</fact1> * 2 = 60 apples. She also gathered <fact3>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact3>, which is 15 * 3 = 45 apples. In total, Joanne's sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples. Since the sisters gathered a combined total of <fact4>500 apples</fact4>, Joanne gathered 500 - 105 = 395 apples. We already know that Joanne gathered <fact1>30 apples</fact1> from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, so she gathered 395 - 30 - 15 = 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is {350}."
11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Reformatted Question: Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>.

Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>.  Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To determine how many flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to determine how many flowers can fit in her flower bed. Since Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> and she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>, we need to convert the width of the flowers and the space between them to the same units. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the width of the flowers is <fact3>12 inches</fact3> / 12 = 1 foot and the space between them is <fact4>1.5 feet</fact4>. Therefore, each flower will occupy 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet of space in the flower bed. Since Pat's flower bed is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>, she can fit 111 / 2.5 = 44.4 flowers in her flower bed. However, she already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she only needs to buy 44.4 - 17 = 27.4 flowers. Since she can't buy a fraction of a flower, she will need to buy 28 flowers. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>, so Pat will spend 28 x $6 = $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed. The answer is {168}."

How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: 
The total time John spent on the events described in <fact2>30% of the time</fact2> is <fact3>6 hours</fact3> + <fact3>6</fact3>/2 = <fact3>6</fact3> + <fact3>6</fact3>/2 = 9 hours for boating and swimming, and <fact5>3</fact5> * <fact6>2</fact6> = 6 hours for the shows. This makes a total of 9 + 6 = 15 hours for the events described in <fact2>30% of the time</fact2>. Since these events account for <fact2>30% of the time</fact2>, the total time is 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours. Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is <fact1>40% of 50 hours</fact1> = 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to calculate the total expenses first. The total number of clients is <fact1>3</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 8. Each client needs <fact6>2 bottles of bleach</fact6> at <fact3>$2 each</fact3>, so the total cost of bleach per client is <fact6>2</fact6> * <fact3>$2</fact3> = $4. The total cost of bleach for all clients is $4 * 8 = $32. Each client also needs a pack of cloths at <fact4>$5 each</fact4>, so the total cost of cloths for all clients is <fact4>$5</fact4> * 8 = $40. The total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer: The teacher started with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1> and used up <fact4>45% of the chalk</fact4> on Monday. This means he used up 0.45 * <fact1>5 inches</fact1> = 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. So, he has <fact1>5 inches</fact1> - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches of chalk left. The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>, so he has 2.75 inches - <fact2>2 inches</fact2> = 0.75 inches of chalk left to use. The teacher uses <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, which is 0.2 * <fact1>5 inches</fact1> = 1 inch of chalk per day. So, he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 0.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 0.75 days. However, since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, he has 0.75 days / 1 day = 0.75, which rounds down to 0 days left to use the full 1 inch of chalk. But he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 1 day if he uses less than 1 inch of chalk on that day. So, he can use the remaining chalk for 1 day if he uses less than 1 inch of chalk on that day, but in this case, he will use the full 1 inch of chalk, so he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 1 day if he uses less than 1 inch of chalk on that day. However, the problem states that he uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day, which is 0.2 * 2.75 inches = 0.55 inches of chalk per day. So, he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 0.75 inches / 0.55 inches per day = 1.36 days. However, since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, he has 1.36 days / 1 day = 1.36, which rounds down to 1 day. However, he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 1 day if he uses less than 0.55 inches of chalk on that day, but in this case, he will use the full 0.55 inches of chalk, so he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 1 day if he uses less than 0.55 inches of chalk on that day. However, the problem states that he uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day, which is 0.2 * 2.75 inches = 0.55 inches of chalk per day. So, he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 0.75 inches / 0.55 inches per day = 1.36 days. However, since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, he has 1.36 days / 1 day = 1.36, which rounds down to 1 day. So, he can use the remaining 0.75 inches of chalk for 1 day if he uses less than 0.55 inches of chalk on that day, but in this case, he will use the full 0.55 inches of chalk. So, he has 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.2 inches of chalk left after 1 day. The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>, so he has 2.2 inches - <fact2>2 inches</fact2> = 0.2 inches of chalk left to use. The teacher uses <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact"

Answer: 
To find the volume of the pool, we multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool: <fact2>25 feet</fact2> * <fact1>14 feet</fact1> * <fact3>4 feet</fact3> = 1400 cubic feet. Then we multiply this volume by <fact4>5.9</fact4> to find the number of gallons of water needed: 1400 * <fact4>5.9</fact4> = 8260 gallons. Finally, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, <fact5>$0.10</fact5>, to find the total cost: 8260 * <fact5>$0.10</fact5> = $826. The answer is {826}."

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","Reformatted Question: 
Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in <fact1>15 minutes</fact1>. They decide to do it on a football field that is <fact2>100 yards long</fact2>. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the <fact3>40-yard line</fact3> and back. She does this <fact4>34 times</fact4>. Blake runs back and forth <fact5>15 times</fact5>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Answer: 
Kelly runs back and forth once, which is <fact2>100 yards</fact2> * 2 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the <fact3>40-yard line</fact3> and back, which is <fact3>40 yards</fact3> * 2 = 80 yards. She does this <fact4>34 times</fact4>, so she runs an additional 80 * <fact4>34</fact4> = 2720 yards. So Kelly runs a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards. Blake runs back and forth <fact5>15 times</fact5>, which is <fact2>100 yards</fact2> * 2 * <fact5>15</fact5> = 3000 yards. So Blake runs 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards more than Kelly. The answer is {80}."

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. How many cookies does Jenny eat?

Answer: The total number of cookies in the bag is <fact3>36 cookies</fact3>. Jenny's husband eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>, so he eats 1*7 = 7 cookies. Jenny puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>, so her son eats 4*5 = 20 cookies. The total number of cookies eaten by Jenny's husband and son is 7 + 20 = 27 cookies. Therefore, Jenny eats <fact3>36 cookies</fact3> - 27 cookies = 9 cookies. The answer is {9}."
19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet.

The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: The area of the north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3> = 80 square feet each. Since there are two walls, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet. The area of the east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4> = 40 square feet each. Since there are two walls, the total area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet. The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. To cover this area, Tony needs 240 / <fact1>20 square feet per gallon</fact1> = 12 gallons of paint. The total cost will be 12 * <fact2>$12 per gallon</fact2> = $144. The answer is {144}."

On <fact9>days one and two</fact9>, Mack saw a total of <fact10>50 birds</fact10>. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?

Answer: 
To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to first find the total number of birds he saw in a week. On <fact3>days four and five</fact3>, he saw a total of <fact4>120</fact4> * 2 = 240 birds. On <fact5>day six</fact5> he saw <fact6>20</fact6> birds and on <fact7>day seven</fact7> he saw <fact8>90</fact8> birds. So, in the last 4 days of the week, Mack saw 240 + <fact6>20</fact6> + <fact8>90</fact8> = 350 birds. On <fact9>days one and two</fact9>, Mack saw a total of <fact10>50 birds</fact10>. On <fact1>day three</fact1>, he saw <fact2>none</fact2>. So, in total, Mack saw 350 + <fact10>50</fact10> = 400 birds. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days in a week. 400 / 7 = 57.14. The answer is {57}."

Answer: In the first <fact7>30 seconds</fact7>, <fact5>20</fact5> kernels popped. In the next <fact7>30 seconds</fact7>, <fact6>three times that amount</fact6>, or <fact5>20</fact5>*3 = 60 kernels popped. Since the popping rate increased to <fact1>four times the initial popping rate</fact1> after <fact2>sixty seconds</fact2>, the initial popping rate was <fact5>20</fact5>/30 seconds = 2/3 kernels per second. So, the new popping rate is <fact1>four times</fact1> that, or 8/3 kernels per second. For the next <fact7>30 seconds</fact7>, the popping rate was <fact4>half the rate as the past 30 seconds</fact4>, or 4/3 kernels per second.

The <fact6>Dachshund</fact6> weighed twice as much as the <fact5>Affenpinscher</fact5> (<fact1>10 pounds</fact1>), so the <fact6>Dachshund</fact6> weighed <fact1>10</fact1> * 2 = 20 pounds. The <fact3>Papillon</fact3> weighed one-fourth as much as the <fact6>Dachshund</fact6> (20 pounds), so the <fact3>Papillon</fact3> weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. The <fact4>Mastiff</fact4> weighed 44 times the weight of the <fact3>Papillon</fact3> (5 pounds), so the <fact4>Mastiff</fact4> weighed 5 * 44 = 220 pounds. The answer is {220}."

He ate <fact4>cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week</fact4> using <fact5>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</fact5>. How many slices of cheese did he use?

Answer: Carl ate <fact1>a sandwich every day this week for lunch</fact1>, which means he ate 7 sandwiches. He used <fact2>2 slices of cheese on each sandwich</fact2>, so he used 7 x <fact2>2</fact2> = 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches. He also used <fact3>8 slices of cheese in it</fact3> for his macaroni and cheese. He ate <fact4>cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week</fact4> using <fact5>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</fact5>, which means he used <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact5>1</fact5> = 3 slices of cheese per omelet.

Answer: Jack can play a game with <fact2>1 quarter</fact2> for <fact3>20 minutes</fact3>. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, so they can play for <fact3>20</fact3>/<fact6>2</fact6> = 10 minutes per quarter. One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact5>1.5 times as long</fact5>, so he can play for <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact5>1.5</fact5> = 30 minutes per quarter.

How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs <fact5>$10</fact5>?

Answer: 
A third of the movies are in series, so that is <fact1>600</fact1>/3 = 200 movies. The remaining movies are <fact1>600</fact1> - 200 = 400 movies. Of those, <fact2>40%</fact2> are older movies, so that is <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>400</fact1> = 160 movies. This leaves <fact1>400</fact1> - 160 = 240 movies that are not in series and are not older movies. The movies in series cost <fact4>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact4>, so they cost <fact4>$6</fact4>/<fact5>$10</fact5> = $6. The older movies cost <fact3>$5</fact3>. The other movies cost <fact5>$10</fact5>. Therefore, the cost of replacing the movies is 200 * <fact4>$6</fact4> + 160 * <fact3>$5</fact3> + 240 * <fact5>$10</fact5> = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

Answer: On the first day, Wanda filled <fact1>1/4</fact1> of the tank's capacity, which is <fact1>1/4</fact1> * <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4</fact2> as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day, which is <fact2>3/4</fact2> * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons. So, on the first day, they filled 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3</fact3> of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is <fact3>2/3</fact3> * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact4>1/3</fact4> of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is <fact4>1/3</fact4> * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons. So, on the second day, they filled 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons. In total, they filled 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. Therefore, there are <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons remaining for the tank to be full. The answer is {6000}."

Boris produces <fact2>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact2>. How much does he produce the fourth week?

Answer: Boris produces <fact2>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact2>. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week, so he produces <fact2>8,000</fact2>/2 = 4,000 bars. The third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces <fact2>8,000</fact2> * 3 = 24,000 bars.

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?

Answer: 
Rose picked <fact1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</fact1>, so she picked 3 * 5 = 15 petals from the first set of flowers. She then picked <fact2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</fact2>, so she picked 4 * 6 = 24 petals from the second set of flowers. She then picked <fact3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</fact3>, so she picked 5 * 4 = 20 petals from the third set of flowers. She then dropped <fact4>1 of each</fact4>, which means she dropped 1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 4 = 15 petals. She then picked <fact5>6 flowers with 7 petals each</fact5>, so she picked 6 * 7 = 42 petals from the fourth set of flowers.

They can fit <fact2>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact2>. They also have <fact3>10 boxes of stuff already</fact3>. If they already own <fact4>15 tables</fact4>, how many new tables do they need?

Answer: The charity group received <fact1>10 people</fact1> * <fact1>5 boxes of stuff each</fact1> = 50 boxes of stuff from donations. They already had <fact3>10 boxes of stuff</fact3>, so they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff. Since they can fit <fact2>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact2>, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables. They already own <fact4>15 tables</fact4>, so they will need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","Reformatted Question: 
Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>, which was <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>. Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>. How many did each person get?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. According to <fact3>Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact3>, Carlos collected 2x seashells. According to <fact2>Jim collected 5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>, Jim collected 2x + 5 = 27 seashells, as given in <fact1>Jim collected 27 seashells</fact1>. Now we can solve for x: 2x + 5 = 27, 2x = 22, x = 11. So Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2x = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells. In total, they collected 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 seashells. They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells. The answer is {20}."

Twice per month he writes a check to the <fact4>church</fact4>.  How many checks does Buford write per year?

Answer: Buford writes a check for the <fact1>gas bill</fact1> every month. So, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year. Buford writes a check for the <fact2>pest and lawn service</fact2> quarterly, which is 4 times per year.

Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: First, we calculate the total cost of the shirt after the discount. The original price of the shirt is <fact2>$25</fact2>, and the discount is <fact3>30%</fact3> of that. So the discount is <fact2>$25</fact2> * <fact3>30%</fact3> = <fact2>$25</fact2> * 0.3 = $7.50. The price of the shirt after the discount is <fact2>$25</fact2> - $7.50 = $17.50. The total cost of the outfit is the cost of the shirt after the discount plus the cost of the shorts, which is $17.50 + <fact4>$35</fact4> = $52.50. However, Joe only has <fact1>$50</fact1>, so he doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit. The answer is {0}"

Answer: Sheila originally charged <fact1>$85.00</fact1> on her credit card. She returned an item that cost <fact2>$15.00</fact2>, so her new balance would be <fact1>$85.00</fact1> - <fact2>$15.00</fact2> = $70.00.

How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the <fact5>minimum threshold is 400 points</fact5>?

Answer: To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to find out the total number of points collected by the class and subtract it from the minimum threshold of <fact5>400 points</fact5>. 

Adam has collected <fact1>50 points</fact1>. Betty was better than Adam and collected <fact4>30% more</fact4>, so she has <fact1>50</fact1> + <fact1>50</fact1>*<fact4>0.3</fact4> = <fact1>50</fact1> + 15 = 65 points. Tom has <fact3>30 points less than Betty</fact3>, so he has 65 - <fact3>30</fact3> = 35 points. Marta managed to collect <fact2>3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, so she has <fact2>3</fact2> * 35 = 105 points.

71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Reformatted Question: 
Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out <fact1>17 fish</fact1> out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <fact2>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact2>. Bob started with <fact3>7 fish</fact3> in his pond. <fact4>3 were orange</fact4>, and <fact5>4 were white</fact5>.

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the store as <variable>x</variable>. Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish he bought at the store is <fact2>2x</fact2>. We know that Bob bought a total of <fact1>17 fish</fact1> at the store, so we can set up the equation <variable>x</variable> + <fact2>2x</fact2> = <fact1>17</fact1>. Solving for <variable>x</variable>, we get <variable>x</variable> = <fact1>17</fact1> / <fact2>3</fact2> = 5.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this is rounded down to 5 (as 5.67 rounded up would be 6 which would be 2*6=12 orange fish and 5+6=11 total fish, which is more than 17 fish), and the number of orange fish would be <fact2>2*5</fact2> = 10, and the total number of fish would be 5+10=15, which is less than 17 fish. However, if we round 5.67 to 6, the total number of fish would be 6+12=18 which is more than 17 fish, so we can't round up to 6, so we round down to 5, but we still have 17-15=2 fish left, so we must round 5.67 up to 6, but we can't, so we must round 5.67 down to 5, but we still have 2 fish left, so we must have 5 white fish and 11 orange fish and 1 more white fish, which is 6 white fish, which would be 2*6=12 orange fish, and 6+12=18 which is more than 17 fish, so we must have 5 white fish and 12 orange fish, which is 5+12=17 fish."
72,"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.

This year, he collected <fact2>twice the number of stickers as the previous year</fact2>. Last year, Leo collected <fact3>50 stickers</fact3>. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?

Answer: To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year. We know Leo had <fact1>100 stickers</fact1> two years ago. We also know that Leo collected <fact3>50 stickers</fact3> last year. This year, Leo collected <fact2>twice the number of stickers as the previous year</fact2>, so he collected 2 * <fact3>50 stickers</fact3> = 100 stickers this year.

How many toys per hour does the <fact7>fifth worker</fact7> produce?

Answer: 
In <fact3>10 hours</fact3>, the first <fact5>2 workers</fact5> produce <fact5>6 toys per hour</fact5> * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 60 toys each, for a total of 120 toys. The second <fact6>2 workers</fact6> produce <fact6>4 toys per hour</fact6> * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 40 toys each, for a total of 80 toys. This means that the first <fact5>2 workers</fact5> and the second <fact6>2 workers</fact6> together produce 120 + 80 = 200 toys. The manufacturer needs <fact1>400 toys</fact1> - <fact4>20 toys</fact4> = 380 toys to complete the order. Therefore, the <fact7>fifth worker</fact7> must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in <fact3>10 hours</fact3>.

How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the <fact6>7th grade</fact6>?

Answer: To determine the total number of questions that Audrey needs to answer correctly, we first need to determine the total number of questions on both tests. The first test has <fact3>70 questions</fact3>, and the second test has <fact2>40 questions</fact2>, so there are <fact3>70</fact3> + <fact2>40</fact2> = 110 questions total.

Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is <fact1>0.15 cubic inches</fact1>. He also knows that they get about <fact2>80%</fact2> efficiency in packing. He estimates <fact3>30%</fact3> of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is <fact4>6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall</fact4>.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact5>900</fact5>.  How far off was his guess?

Answer: To determine how far off his guess was, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and the total number of jelly beans that can fit in it. The volume of the jar is <fact4>6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches</fact4> = 540 cubic inches. Since they get about <fact2>80%</fact2> efficiency in packing, the effective volume for jelly beans is 540 * <fact2>0.8</fact2> = 432 cubic inches. The number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / <fact1>0.15</fact1> = 2880. Since Tim estimates that <fact3>30%</fact3> of the jelly beans are red, he would guess that there are 2880 * <fact3>0.3</fact3> = 864 red jelly beans. The true number of red jelly beans is <fact5>900</fact5>, so his guess is off by 900 - 864 = 36. The answer is {36}."

She also ordered <fact2>200 pink calla lilies</fact2>, which were <fact3>five times the number of white carnations</fact3>. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?

Answer: First, we need to figure out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that she ordered <fact2>200 pink calla lilies</fact2> and that this is <fact3>five times the number of white carnations</fact3>. So, the number of white carnations is <fact2>200</fact2>/<fact3>5</fact3> = 40. Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find out how many red roses she ordered. We know that she ordered <fact1>four times as many red roses as white carnations</fact1>, so she ordered <fact1>4</fact1> * 40 = 160 red roses. The answer is {160}."

Answer: The jogger jeans cost <fact3>$28</fact3> - <fact4>$6</fact4> = $22. The amount saved from the jogger jeans is <fact5>$6</fact5> * <fact6>1/3</fact6> = $2. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is <fact5>$6</fact5> - $2 = $4. This means the tattered jeans originally cost <fact3>$28</fact3> - $4 = $24. However, this is not the answer. The answer is the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost $22 and the tattered jeans originally cost $24, the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $22 = $2 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks for how much more jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost $2 less than the tattered jeans, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 less than the tattered jeans, not more. Therefore, the answer is -$2. However, the answer cannot be negative, so the question must be asking for the absolute difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. Therefore, the answer is $2."

This is a total of $20 + $100 = $120 per month on <fact2>treats</fact2> and <fact3>medicine</fact3>. Since there are <fact4>4 weeks in a month</fact4>, Madeline spends <fact1>$25 per week</fact1> * <fact4>4 weeks per month</fact4> = $100 per month on <fact1>food</fact1>. So, Madeline spends $120 + $100 = $220 per month on her dog. Since there are 12 months in a year, Madeline spends $220 * 12 = $2640 per year on her dog. The answer is {2640}."

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","Reformatted Question: Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a <fact1>30-minute show</fact1>. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a <fact2>1-hour episode</fact2> of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a <fact2>1-hour episode</fact2> and a <fact1>30-minute show</fact1>.

If he watched <fact3>7 hours</fact3> of TV in all, how many <fact1>30-minute episodes</fact1> did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday. Since Frankie watched a <fact2>1-hour episode</fact2> each night, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a <fact2>1-hour episode</fact2> and a <fact1>30-minute show</fact1>, which is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two <fact2>1-hour episodes</fact2>, which is 2 hours. In total, he watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Since he watched <fact3>7 hours</fact3> of TV in all, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday. Since each episode is <fact1>30 minutes</fact1>, he watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes on Wednesday. The answer is {3}."

He lost <fact3>10 bills</fact3> while getting home.  How many <fact2>5 dollar bills</fact2> does he have?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many 20 dollar bills Thomas withdrew from the bank account. Since he withdrew <fact1>$1000 in 20 dollar bills</fact1>, he has 1000/20 = 50 twenty dollar bills. After losing <fact3>10 bills</fact3>, he had 50 - 10 = 40 twenty dollar bills left. After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he had 40/2 = 20 twenty dollar bills left. Thomas then triples his money, which means he now has 3 * 20 * 20 = 1200 dollars. He then converts all his bills to <fact2>5 dollar bills</fact2>. So he now has 1200/5 = 240 five dollar bills.

Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","Reformatted Question: 
To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted <fact1>10 more White Oak trees</fact1> and <fact2>1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees</fact2> on the second day than he planted on the first day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak</fact4>. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.

Answer: 
On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak</fact4>, which is 2 * <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> = 40 trees of Lodgepole Pine. So on the first day, he planted <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> + 40 trees of Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees. On the second day, Mr. Julius planted <fact1>10 more White Oak trees</fact1> than he planted on the first day, which is <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> = 30 trees of White Oak. He also planted <fact2>1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees</fact2> than he planted on the first day, which is 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 50 trees of Lodgepole Pine. So on the second day, he planted 30 trees of White Oak + 50 trees of Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140 trees. The answer is {140}."

On the second day, Gunther added another <fact4>25 bananas</fact4> to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another <fact5>12 of the bananas</fact5>. How many bananas did Gunther count to be in the pile?

Answer: Arnold stole <fact2>half of the bananas</fact2> on the first day, so he stole <fact1>48</fact1>/2 = 24 bananas. So after the first day, Gunther had <fact1>48</fact1> - 24 = 24 bananas left.

How much does he pay a year for driving?,"Reformatted Question: John hires a driving service to get him to work each day. He goes to work <fact1>5 days a week</fact1> for <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2>. His work is <fact3>30 miles away</fact3> and he has to go there and back each day. He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4> and he also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer: To find the total amount John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile, and then add the total bonus given per year. 

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work <fact3>30 miles away</fact3> and has to go there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. Since he goes to work <fact1>5 days a week</fact1> for <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2>, the total miles driven per year is 60 * <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact2>50</fact2> = 15,000 miles. 

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven per year multiplied by the cost per mile, which is 15,000 * <fact4>$2</fact4> = $30,000.

The total bonus given per year is <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5> * 12 months = $1,800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800. The answer is {31800}."

Originally, he wanted to make <fact4>twice as many as he did last year</fact4>. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. According to the information, Henry originally wanted to make <fact4>twice as many as he did last year</fact4>, so he wanted to make 2x cookies. However, he actually baked <fact1>15 more cookies than he meant to</fact1>, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping <fact2>5 of his cookies</fact2>, he now has a total of <fact3>110 cookies</fact3>. Therefore, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110. Simplifying the equation, 2x + 10 = 110.

Answer: Shawnda inflated <fact1>5 bicycles</fact1> * <fact5>2 tires per bicycle</fact5> = 10 bicycle tires. She also inflated <fact2>3 tricycles</fact2> * <fact6>3 tires per tricycle</fact6> = 9 tricycle tires. And she inflated <fact3>1 unicycle</fact3> * <fact7>1 tire per unicycle</fact7> = 1 unicycle tire. So she inflated a total of 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Since each tire costs <fact4>25 cents to inflate</fact4>, Shawnda made 20 * <fact4>25 cents</fact4> = 500 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, Shawnda made 500/100 = 5 dollars. The answer is {5}."

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Reformatted Question: Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals. She feeds each of the chickens <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1>, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens <fact2>15 cups of feed</fact2>.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another <fact3>25 cups of feed</fact3>.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is <fact4>20 chickens</fact4>?

Answer: Wendi has <fact4>20 chickens</fact4> and she feeds each of them <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1> per meal. So, for each meal, she needs <fact4>20 chickens</fact4> * <fact1>3 cups of feed per chicken</fact1> = 60 cups of feed. She has already given her chickens <fact2>15 cups of feed</fact2> in the morning and <fact3>25 cups of feed</fact3> in the afternoon, for a total of <fact2>15 cups of feed</fact2> + <fact3>25 cups of feed</fact3> = 40 cups of feed.

Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1>, there's a <fact2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact2>. There's a <fact3>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</fact3>. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact4>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact4>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer: 
If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1>, there's a <fact2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact2>. This means there's a 100% - <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60% chance that the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1> and she won't give everyone an extension. There's a <fact3>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</fact3>, so there's a 100% - <fact3>50%</fact3> = 50% chance that the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1>. Combining these probabilities, there's a <fact3>50%</fact3> * 60% = 30% chance that the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1> and she won't give everyone an extension. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1> and she won't give everyone an extension, there's still a <fact4>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact4>. This means there's a 100% - <fact4>20%</fact4> = 80% chance that the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1>, she won't give everyone an extension, and Marcus won't be able to convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. So, there's a 30% * 80% = 24% chance that the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1>, she won't give everyone an extension, and Marcus won't be able to convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in</fact1> and gives everyone an extension, or if she doesn't give everyone an extension but Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment, or if there's a <fact3>substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</fact3>, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. This means there's a 100% - 24% = 76% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework, and a 24% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. The answer is {24}."
112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted Question: 
Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each <fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>. A <fact2>small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. A <fact3>large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>. Lorraine starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact6>50%</fact6> of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <fact7>90%</fact7> of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many large stickers she traded for large buttons. She traded <fact6>50%</fact6> of her <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>, which is <fact6>50%</fact6> * <fact5>40</fact5> = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button (<fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>), she got 20 large buttons. Then, she traded the rest of her large stickers, which is <fact5>40</fact5> - 20 = 20 large stickers, for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons (<fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>), she got 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. Next, she traded <fact7>90%</fact7> of her <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4>, which is <fact7>90%</fact7> * <fact4>30</fact4> = 27 small stickers, for large buttons. Since a large button is worth three small stickers (<fact3>large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>), she got 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons. Therefore, she has a total of 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. The answer is {89}."

We know the purchasing habits of 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 customers, which is all of them. Therefore, he sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs. The answer is {7}."
129,Tom plants 10 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?,"Reformatted Question: Tom plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1>.  He starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2>.  After <fact3>10 years</fact3> <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>.  Every year he also chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5>.  How many trees does he have left?

Answer: Tom starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2> and plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, so he plants 10*10=100 trees. He also chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, so he chops down 2*10=20 trees. After <fact3>10 years</fact3>, he has 50+100-20=130 trees. Then <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>, which is 0.3*130=39 trees. So, he has 130-39=91 trees left. The answer is {91}."
130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Smith has two farms, <fact1>Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>Farm Y</fact2>. He sold <fact3>10 goats from Farm X</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact4>. He has <fact5>55 goats in Farm X</fact5> and <fact6>45 goats in Farm Y</fact6>. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?

Answer: Mr. Smith sold <fact3>10 goats from Farm X</fact3>, so he has <fact5>55 goats in Farm X</fact5> - <fact3>10 goats</fact3> = 45 goats left in Farm X. He sold <fact4>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact4> as from Farm X, so he sold <fact3>10</fact3> * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Thus, he has <fact6>45 goats in Farm Y</fact6> - 20 goats = 25 goats left in Farm Y. Therefore, Mr. Smith has 45 goats left in Farm X + 25 goats left in Farm Y = 70 goats left in the two farms altogether. The answer is {70}."

He can make logs out of <fact4>80%</fact4> of the tree. From each of those logs, he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5>.  How much does he make?

Answer: John can make logs out of <fact4>80%</fact4> of the tree, which is <fact4>80%</fact4> * <fact1>80 feet</fact1> = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet. Since each log is <fact2>4 feet</fact2> long, he can make 64 / <fact2>4</fact2> = 16 logs. From each log, he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5>, so he can make 16 * <fact5>5</fact5> = 80 planks. He sells each plank for <fact3>$1.2</fact3>, so he makes 80 * <fact3>$1.2</fact3> = $96. The answer is {96}."

The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"Reformatted Question: Each muffaletta sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1> and would serve <fact2>4 people</fact2>.  Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. The <fact3>meat cost $7.00 per pound</fact3> and the <fact4>cheese cost $3.00 per pound</fact4>. There would be <fact5>20 people</fact5> in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>?

Answer: To determine how much money he would spend, first, we need to find out how many sandwiches he needs to make. Since each sandwich serves <fact2>4 people</fact2> and there are <fact5>20 people</fact5>, he needs to make <fact5>20</fact5>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 5 sandwiches. Since each sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound of meat</fact1> and <fact1>1 pound of cheese</fact1>, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. The total cost of the meat is <fact3>$7.00 per pound</fact3> * 5 pounds = $35. The total cost of the cheese is <fact4>$3.00 per pound</fact4> * 5 pounds = $15. Therefore, the total amount of money he would spend on the meat and cheese is $35 + $15 = $50. The answer is {50}."
133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?,"Reformatted Question: 
Cole hid <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds <fact3>2 less than Stacy</fact3>.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: 
First, we find out how many eggs Cole hid in total. Since <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> is the same as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs, Cole hid 36 eggs in the yard. 
Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds <fact2>5</fact2> * 2 = 10 eggs. 
Charlie finds <fact3>2 less than Stacy</fact3>, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. 
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. 
So, the total number of eggs found is <fact2>5</fact2> + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. 
Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs. The answer is {9}."

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>?

Answer: Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> that he separates into groups of <fact4>8</fact4>. So he will have <fact3>200</fact3>/<fact4>8</fact4> = 25 boxes. Each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>, so all the crayons weigh <fact1>1 ounce</fact1> * <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> = 200 ounces. Each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>, so all the boxes weigh <fact5>8 ounces</fact5> * 25 boxes = 200 ounces. So the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces. Since each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>, the total weight in pounds is 400/<fact2>16</fact2> = 25 pounds. The answer is {25}."

Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Twice as many students need size small as extra small.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Reformatted Question: Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. <fact1>Four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>. <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>. <fact3>Half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>. <fact4>Six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>. <fact5>Twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>. Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

Answer: Let's denote the number of students who need size small as S, size medium as M, size large as L, size extra-large as XL, and size extra-small as XS. We know that <fact5>twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>, so S = 2 * XS. We also know that <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>, so XS = 11. Therefore, S = 2 * 11 = 22. We know that <fact1>four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>, so M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18. We know that <fact3>half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>, so L = M / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9. We know that <fact4>six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>, so XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15. Now, we can find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered by adding the number of students who need each size: S + M + L + XL + XS = 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 + 11 = 75. The answer is {75}."

Answer: Colby spent <fact5>$10</fact5> * <fact1>5 movies</fact1> = $50 on movies on Fridays and Saturdays and <fact6>$7</fact6> * <fact2>8 movies</fact2> = $56 on movies on other days. He also spent <fact7>$8</fact7> * <fact3>2 tubs of popcorn</fact3> = $16 on popcorn and <fact8>$2</fact8> * <fact4>four boxes of candy</fact4> = $8 on candy.

He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra <fact6>$3.00</fact6> which will add chips and a drink.   How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is <fact7>$6.50</fact7>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of Chad's meal. The base burrito costs <fact7>$6.50</fact7>.

She uses the same amount of <fact1>citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and the same amount of <fact2>salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3> each time. She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact4>twice as much salt as zest</fact4>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x (<fact1>citrus zest as fragrance</fact1>), the amount of salt is 2x (<fact4>twice as much salt as zest</fact4>), the amount of sugar is also 2x (<fact2>salt as sugar</fact2>), and the amount of oil is 4x (<fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4>). We know that the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces (<fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3>), so x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. Combining like terms, we get 10x = 10. Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 1. Therefore, the amount of oil is 4x = 4(1) = 4 ounces. The answer is {4}."

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","Reformatted Question: Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up <fact1>50%</fact1> in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten <fact2>2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> that cost her <fact3>$10 each</fact3>. She also has five <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> she bought for <fact5>$16 each</fact5>. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer: First, we need to determine the current selling price of the boards. Since the prices have gone up <fact1>50%</fact1>, the selling price of the <fact2>2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> will be <fact3>$10</fact3> + <fact3>$10</fact3> * <fact1>50%</fact1> = <fact3>$10</fact3> + <fact3>$10</fact3> * 0.5 = $15. The selling price of the <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> will be <fact5>$16</fact5> + <fact5>$16</fact5> * <fact1>50%</fact1> = <fact5>$16</fact5> + <fact5>$16</fact5> * 0.5 = $24. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost price of the boards. The cost price of the <fact2>2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> is 10 * <fact3>$10</fact3> = $100. The cost price of the <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> is 5 * <fact5>$16</fact5> = $80. 

The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180. 

The total selling price of the <fact2>2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> is 10 * $15 = $150. The total selling price of the <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> is 5 * $24 = $120. 

The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270. 

The profit made by Sasha is the total selling price - the total cost price = $270 - $180 = $90. The answer is {90}."

How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Answer: A normal student has <fact1>6 periods in the day</fact1> * <fact2>40 minutes per period</fact2> = 240 minutes per day. With <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>, he has 240 + <fact5>2</fact5> * <fact2>40 minutes per period</fact2> = 320 minutes per day. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, so he has 320 * <fact3>5</fact3> = 1600 minutes per week. His weekly minutes are 320 * 7 = 2240 minutes. He spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> on Saturday and Sunday, which is <fact4>1/16</fact4> * 2240 = 140 minutes each day. So he spends 140 * 2 = 280 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Answer: To get an average of <fact5>93</fact5>, we need to find the total score of the 5 tests (excluding the lowest score) and divide it by 5. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the <fact2>lowest score</fact2> from the average, we will exclude the lowest score of 71. The total score of the remaining 4 tests is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. To get an average of <fact5>93</fact5>, the total score of the 5 tests (excluding the lowest score) should be 93 * 5 = 465. Since we already have a total score of 367 from the first 4 tests (excluding the lowest score), we need a score of 465 - 367 = 98 on the <fact4>sixth test</fact4> to get an average of <fact5>93</fact5>.

Answer: On the <fact7>first day</fact7>, the nurses used <fact8>38 bandages</fact8> and ordered <fact9>one bulk pack of bandages</fact9> (<fact1>50 bandages</fact1>). So they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the <fact7>first day</fact7>. On the <fact5>second day</fact5>, they used <fact6>ten fewer bandages</fact6> compared to the <fact7>first day</fact7>, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?

Answer: The <fact7>king cab is an extra $7,500</fact7>. <fact8>Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade</fact8>, so they are <fact7>$7,500</fact7>/3 = $2,500. <fact9>Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats</fact9>, so they are $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had <fact1>four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day</fact1>. They dug <fact2>ten holes the first day</fact2>, <fact3>thirteen holes the second day</fact3>, and <fact4>eight holes the third day</fact4>. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in <fact5>two holes the pirates kept falling in</fact5>. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?

Answer: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and the end of the fourth day. We know that the island had <fact1>four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day</fact1>. At the end of the first day, there were <fact2>ten holes</fact2>. So, at the end of the fourth day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes. Now, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day, excluding the holes dug on the fourth day. On the second day, they dug <fact3>thirteen holes</fact3>, and on the third day, they dug <fact4>eight holes</fact4> but also filled in <fact5>two holes</fact5>, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. Since the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes. The answer is {11}."

The second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4> and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Answer: The first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>. The second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4>, which is <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact4>4</fact4> = 14 bananas per day. There are <fact3>7 days</fact3> in a week. So, the first monkey eats <fact1>10</fact1> * <fact3>7</fact3> = 70 bananas per week, and the second monkey eats 14 * <fact3>7</fact3> = 98 bananas per week. Together, the first two monkeys eat 70 + 98 = 168 bananas per week. Since Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2> per week, the third monkey must eat <fact2>315</fact2> - 168 = 147 bananas per week.

Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has <fact1>54 lines</fact1> in the lyrics. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, and <fact3>four-fifths of them are his</fact3>. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, but <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Answer: Sean has to memorize the <fact1>54 lines</fact1> in the song. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, which is 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since <fact3>four-fifths of them are his</fact3>, Sean has to memorize (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines for the second scene. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>, Sean has to memorize (1/3) * 108 = 36 lines for the first scene. In total, Sean has to memorize 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines. The answer is {138}."

No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Reformatted Question: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1> that are kept alone and each hamster is given <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2>. The rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3> and each rat is given <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>.

If <fact6>160 pieces of straw</fact6> have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer: The hamsters use <fact1>10</fact1> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw. The rabbits use <fact5>20</fact5> pieces of straw. So the rats use <fact6>160</fact6> - 50 - <fact5>20</fact5> = 90 pieces of straw. Since each rat is given <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>, there are 90/<fact4>6</fact4> = 15 rats in total. Since the rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3>, there are 15/3 = 5 rats in each cage. The answer is {5}."

And <fact2>eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean</fact2>. <fact3>He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans</fact3>. How many small beans can Grandpa eat?

Answer: Since <fact3>he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans</fact3> and <fact1>it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up</fact1>, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans. Since <fact2>eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean</fact2>, 150 medium-sized beans is the same as 150 * 3 = 450 small beans. Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

Answer: Erika's mom gave her <fact1>$80</fact1>. She was paid <fact3>$150</fact3> for her part-time job. Trading in her old laptop reduced the price of the new laptop by <fact2>$200</fact2>. So the new laptop will cost <fact4>$600</fact4> - <fact2>$200</fact2> = $400. The total amount of money she has from her mom and her part-time job is <fact1>$80</fact1> + <fact3>$150</fact3> = $230. Since she only needs an extra <fact5>$50</fact5> to buy the laptop, she must have $400 - <fact5>$50</fact5> = $350.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","Reformatted Question: Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought <fact1>four packs of gum</fact1> the last time she was at the store.  She paid <fact2>$7 in all</fact2>. She got <fact3>two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry</fact3>. She paid <fact4>$2 for a pack of grape gum</fact4> that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid <fact5>half as much</fact5> for a <fact6>small pack of green apple gum</fact6>. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Answer: Suzie paid <fact2>$7</fact2> for <fact1>four packs of gum</fact1>. We know that one pack of grape gum cost <fact4>$2</fact4> and one pack of green apple gum cost <fact4>$2</fact4>*<fact5>0.5</fact5>= $1. So, these two packs of gum cost $2 + $1 = $3. This means that the two packs of strawberry gum must have cost $7 - $3 = $4. Since there are <fact3>two packs of strawberry gum</fact3>, each pack of strawberry gum must have cost $4 / 2 = $2. The answer is {2}."

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","Reformatted Question: Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in <fact1>10 minutes</fact1>, and this train will stay in the station for <fact2>20 minutes</fact2>. The second train is to arrive <fact3>half an hour after the first train leaves the station</fact3>, and this second train will stay in the station for <fact4>a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station</fact4>.

The third train is to arrive <fact6>an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact6>, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Answer: First, we need to find out when the first train leaves the station. The first train arrives in <fact1>10 minutes</fact1> and stays for <fact2>20 minutes</fact2>, so it leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes. The second train arrives <fact3>half an hour after the first train leaves the station</fact3>, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the start. The second train stays in the station for <fact4>a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station</fact4>, which is <fact2>20</fact2>/4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes. The third train arrives <fact6>an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact6>, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the start. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves after 125 minutes. The fourth train will arrive <fact5>20 minutes after the third train leaves</fact5>, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the start. Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train. The answer is {145}."

If the rink has <fact4>75 cars in total</fact4> how many yellow cars do they have?

Answer: The rink has <fact1>12 red cars</fact1> and <fact2>2 fewer green cars than they have red cars</fact2>, so they have <fact1>12</fact1> - <fact2>2</fact2> = 10 green cars.

Answer: 
Mr. Rogers bought the watch at <fact3>75%</fact3> of its original price, which is <fact3>75%</fact3> * <fact2>$2000</fact2> = $1500.

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is <fact2>$2000</fact2> - $1800 = $200. Then we divide this difference by the original price, which is $200 / <fact2>$2000</fact2> = 0.1, and multiply by 100 to convert to percentage, which is 0.1 * 100 = 10%. The answer is {10}."

James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>.  He swims <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2>. He can swim at a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer: 
To find out how long it took James to get across the lake, we first need to find out how far he swam at his original speed. Since he swam <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2> of the <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>, he swam 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles at his original speed of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. Thus, it took him 12/2 = 6 hours to swim the first part of the lake. Then he rested for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>, so he rested for 6/2 = 3 hours. The remaining distance of the lake is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. Since he finished the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>, it took him 8/(2/2) = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours. The answer is {17}."

The first venue charges a <fact1>flat fee of $200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5 for each person</fact3> who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer: To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we can set the cost of the first venue equal to the cost of the second venue. The cost of the first venue is <fact1>$200</fact1> + <fact3>$5 per person</fact3> * number of guests. The cost of the second venue is <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> * number of guests. Setting these equal to each other, we get <fact1>$200</fact1> + <fact3>$5</fact3> * number of guests = <fact2>$25</fact2> * number of guests. We can solve this for the number of guests. First, subtract <fact3>$5</fact3> * number of guests from both sides to get <fact1>$200</fact1> = <fact2>$25</fact2> * number of guests - <fact3>$5</fact3> * number of guests. Then we can factor out the number of guests on the right-hand side to get <fact1>$200</fact1> = (<fact2>$25</fact2> - <fact3>$5</fact3>) * number of guests. Then we can divide both sides by (<fact2>$25</fact2> - <fact3>$5</fact3>) to get number of guests = <fact1>$200</fact1> / (<fact2>$25</fact2> - <fact3>$5</fact3>). Calculating the right-hand side, we get number of guests = <fact1>$200</fact1> / (<fact2>$25</fact2> - <fact3>$5</fact3>) = <fact1>$200</fact1> / <fact2>$20</fact2> = 10. The answer is {10}."

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Reformatted Question: Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the <fact1>third set</fact1>, he retrieved <fact2>half as many balls</fact2> as in the <fact3>second set</fact3>. He retrieved <fact4>19 tennis balls</fact4> in all. In the <fact5>first of three sets</fact5>, he had to retrieve <fact6>four more balls</fact6> than in the <fact3>second set</fact3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the <fact5>first set</fact5> of the match?

Answer: Let x be the number of balls retrieved in the second set. Then, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, which gives us 2x + x + 2x + 8 = 38. Combining like terms, we get 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 6. Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10. The answer is {10}."

Over the weekend he sold <fact5>20 crates</fact5>. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?

Answer: To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target. He sold <fact2>15 crates</fact2> on Tuesday, <fact3>12 crates</fact3> on Wednesday, <fact4>18 crates</fact4> on Thursday, and <fact5>20 crates</fact5> over the weekend. This gives us a total of <fact2>15</fact2> + <fact3>12</fact3> + <fact4>18</fact4> + <fact5>20</fact5> = 65 crates. Since his target was to sell <fact1>120 crates of bread in a week</fact1>, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target: <fact1>120</fact1> - 65 = 55. Therefore, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates. The answer is {55}."

215,"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant.

Each year it will grow <fact1>7 lemons</fact1>, which he can sell for <fact2>$1.5 each</fact2>. It costs <fact3>$3 a year</fact3> to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost <fact4>$90 to plant</fact4>. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

Answer: To find out how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to find out when his total earnings will exceed his total costs. The cost of planting the tree is <fact4>$90</fact4>. Each year, Carlos will earn <fact1>7 lemons</fact1> * <fact2>$1.5 per lemon</fact2> = $10.50 and spend <fact3>$3</fact3> on the tree, so he will have a net gain of $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 each year. To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of the tree, which is <fact4>$90</fact4>. So, the number of years it will take for Carlos to break even is <fact4>$90</fact4> / $7.50 per year = 12 years. However, the question asks for the number of years it will take before Carlos starts earning money, which means he needs to earn more than he spends. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 1 = 13 years."

How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Answer: To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them, we need to first determine the total amount of money they spent on the birthday surprise. They bought a cake for <fact1>$11</fact1>, 1 dozen balloons for <fact2>$0.5 for 2 balloons</fact2>, which is equivalent to <fact2>$0.5</fact2> * 6 = <fact2>$3</fact2> for 1 dozen balloons, and 2 tubs of ice cream for <fact3>$7 each</fact3>, which is equivalent to <fact3>$7</fact3> * 2 = <fact3>$14</fact3>. The total amount of money they spent is <fact1>$11</fact1> + <fact2>$3</fact2> + <fact3>$14</fact3> = $28. Since the two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother, the total amount of money they had is 2 * x, where x is the amount of money each girl received. Therefore, 2 * x = $28, and x = $28 / 2 = $14. The answer is {14}."

Answer: 
To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to find out how many laps each of them can run. According to the question, Trey can run <fact4>4 more laps</fact4> than Bethany. So, Trey can run <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact4>4</fact4> = 14 laps. Since Shaelyn can run <fact3>half as many laps</fact3> as Trey, she can run 14/2 = 7 laps. Quinn can run <fact2>2 fewer laps</fact2> than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps. Now, we know that Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps</fact1> and Quinn can run 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. The answer is {5}."

He has <fact5>$24 to buy wood for sticks</fact5>. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer: To find the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, we need to compare the cost per stick of each type of wood and then see how many of those sticks he can buy with his budget. Since a <fact1>2 x 4 costs $4</fact1> and he can get <fact3>200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood</fact3>, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick. Since a <fact2>2 x 8 costs $6</fact2> and he can get <fact4>400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood</fact4>, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick. Since $0.015 is less than $0.02, the cheapest lumber is the 2 x 8. With his budget of <fact5>$24</fact5>, he can buy $24 / $6 = 4 of the 2 x 8 pieces of wood. Since he can get 400 sticks from each 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can make 400 * 4 = 1600 sticks. The answer is {1600}."

In total, there were <fact1>12 sodas</fact1> originally. Ellen's brother took <fact3>1 shaken soda</fact3> and <fact4>2 unshaken sodas</fact4>, so 3 sodas were taken. Ellen took <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5>, so 4 sodas were taken in total. There are 12-4 = 8 sodas left. Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is therefore 2/8 = 0.25 = 25%. The answer is {25}."
224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"Reformatted Question: Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> and she spits each one <fact2>10 feet</fact2>.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> she spits each one <fact4>12 feet</fact4>. What is the average total distance spat?

Answer: To find the total distance spat by each person, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat. Zoey spits <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 400 feet. Sydney spits <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> * <fact4>12 feet</fact4> = 420 feet. To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by both people and divide by 2. (400 + 420)/2 = 410. The answer is {410}."
225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reformatted Question: Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours <fact2>4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact2> into his water bottle and <fact3>one ounce from the other bottle</fact3>, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least <fact4>40 degrees</fact4>.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Answer: The total amount of water in the bottle is <fact2>4 ounces</fact2> + <fact3>1 ounce</fact3> = 5 ounces. Since the water is now at least <fact4>40 degrees</fact4>, the total heat of the water is at least 40 * 5 = 200 degrees. The heat from the <fact1>33-degree</fact1> water is <fact1>33</fact1> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 132 degrees. So the heat from the other water is at least 200 - 132 = 68 degrees. Since there is only <fact3>1 ounce</fact3> of this water, its temperature is at least 68/<fact3>1</fact3> = 68 degrees. The answer is {68}."
226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Reformatted Question: Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>.  Over the <fact2>third year</fact2> it depreciated <fact3>20%</fact3>.  Over the <fact4>first year</fact4> it depreciated <fact5>30%</fact5>.  The <fact6>second year</fact6> it depreciated another <fact7>30%</fact7>. How much is the boat worth after the <fact8>three years</fact8>?

Answer: The boat originally cost <fact1>$9000</fact1>. After the <fact4>first year</fact4>, it depreciated <fact5>30%</fact5>, so it was worth <fact1>$9000</fact1>*(1-<fact5>30%</fact5>) = <fact1>$9000</fact1>*0.7 = $6300. After the <fact6>second year</fact6>, it depreciated another <fact7>30%</fact7>, so it was worth $6300*(1-<fact7>30%</fact7>) = $6300*0.7 = $4410. After the <fact2>third year</fact2>, it depreciated <fact3>20%</fact3>, so it was worth $4410*(1-<fact3>20%</fact3>) = $4410*0.8 = $3528. The answer is {3528}."
227,"Each student in Marissa's class started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. There are 30 students in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?","Reformatted Question: Each student in Marissa's class started the year with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>. After <fact2>two months</fact2>, <fact3>1/5 of the total pencils in class were used</fact3>. At the end of the year, only <fact4>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact4> were left. There are <fact5>30 students</fact5> in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?

Answer: There are <fact5>30 students</fact5> in the class, and each student started with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>, so there were a total of <fact1>10</fact1> * <fact5>30</fact5> = 300 pencils at the beginning of the year. After <fact2>two months</fact2>, <fact3>1/5 of the total pencils in class were used</fact3>, which is 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils. This left 300 - 60 = 240 pencils. At the end of the year, only <fact4>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact4> were left, which is 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils. The answer is {80}."
228,"Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","Reformatted Question: Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from <fact1>2:15</fact1> to <fact2>2:38 am</fact2>.  Also, that day she woke up <fact3>5 minutes earlier</fact3> than usual to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at <fact4>10 p.m.</fact4> and wakes up at <fact5>6 a.m.</fact5>. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?

Answer: To find the total minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes she would normally sleep. She usually goes to sleep at <fact4>10 p.m.</fact4> and wakes up at <fact5>6 a.m.</fact5>, which is a total of 8 hours. 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes. However, that day she woke up <fact3>5 minutes earlier</fact3> than usual, so we subtract those 5 minutes. 480 - 5 = 475 minutes. Also, she was sleepwalking from <fact1>2:15</fact1> to <fact2>2:38 am</fact2>, which is a total of 23 minutes. So, we subtract those 23 minutes from the total minutes. 475 - 23 = 452 minutes. The answer is {452}."
