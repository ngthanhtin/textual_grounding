Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by <$50_increase> $50 each time</$50_increase> and <number_of_people>3 other people</number_of_people> each bid once. She accepts the <opening_bid>$200</opening_bid> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after <number_of_people>each of the 3 other people</number_of_people> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer: The opening bid is <$200> $200</$200>, and the bids rise by <$50_increase> $50</$50_increase> each time. Carmen accepts the <opening_bid>$200</opening_bid> as her initial bid. Since <number_of_people>3 other people</number_of_people> each make a bid and Carmen bids after each of them, she bids 4 times in total, including her initial bid. The sequence of Carmen's bids is $200 (initial), $300 (after first bidder), $400 (after second bidder), and $500 (after third bidder). Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $500. The answer is {500}."
1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Reformatted Question:
Steve loves playing video games. His parents get him <fact1>a console along with 5 games</fact1> for his birthday. For <fact2>the third year</fact2> he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money. He also gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>. He saves up enough money to <fact5>buy 1 game per month for a year</fact5>, and then the <fact6>second year he starts buying 2 games a month</fact6>. How many games does Steve have after <fact2>3 years</fact2>?

Answer:
Steve initially receives <fact1>5 games</fact1> on his birthday. In the first year, he buys <fact5>1 game per month for a year</fact5>, which totals 1 * 12 = 12 games. He also receives <fact4>5 games for Christmas</fact4>. Therefore, by the end of the first year, he has 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, he buys <fact6>2 games per month</fact6>, which totals 2 * 12 = 24 games. He again gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas</fact4>. By the end of the second year, he accumulates an additional 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous total, he has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

For the third year, he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3>, which totals 4 * 12 = 48 games. He gets <fact4>5 more games for Christmas</fact4>. Thus, during the third year, he accumulates 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding to the previous total, he has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

Therefore, after <fact2>3 years</fact2>, Steve has 104 games. The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question:
Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact2>a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but only about <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer:
Billy has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to prepare. It takes about <fact2>a minute and a half</fact2>, which is 90 seconds, to peel each potato and about <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. Therefore, for each potato, he spends 90 + 5 = 95 seconds in total. Multiplying this time by the number of potatoes, the total time required is 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds. To convert this to minutes, divide by 60, yielding 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes. So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>. He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>. Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>. He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>. How much money was he out?

Answer: The original cost per CD is <fact4>$15</fact4>, and with <fact5>40% off</fact5>, each CD costs $15 * (1 - 0.40) = $9. James purchased <fact1>10 CDs</fact1>, so he paid 10 * $9 = $90 for them. He sold <fact2>5 CDs</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>. Therefore, he recovered $40. The total money James was out is $90 (total cost) - $40 (amount recovered), which equals $50. The answer is {50}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Reformatted Question:
There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1>. <fact2>One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators</fact2>. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents</fact3> and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer:
First, calculate the total number of seats: <fact1>18 seats per row</fact1> * <fact4>4 rows</fact4> = 72 seats in total.

Next, calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators: <fact2>One-fourth of the seats</fact2> = 72 / 4 = 18 seats.
This means there are 72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining for parents and students.

Calculate how many of the remaining seats are occupied by parents: <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats</fact3> = 54 / 3 = 18 seats for parents.

Thus, the number of seats occupied by students is the remaining seats: 54 - 18 = 36.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium."

If he has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer: Milo has <fact4>two bags</fact4> of glass chips, and each bag holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>, so he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 glass chips. Each square inch of the mosaic requires <fact3>12 glass chips</fact3>. Thus, with 144 chips, he can cover 144 / 12 = 12 square inches. The mosaic is <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>, so to find out how many inches long he can make it, we divide the total number of square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches. Therefore, Milo can make the mosaic 4 inches long."

Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom. His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>. His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> to remove the old carpet, and <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> to install the new carpet. The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>. How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer:
First, calculate the total area of the bedroom: <fact1>18 feet</fact1> * <fact1>12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet.

Next, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
216 square feet * <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> = $864.

Then, calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
216 square feet * (<fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> + <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding</fact5>) = 216 * $14 = $3,024.

Calculate the installation cost of the new carpet:
216 square feet * <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> = $7,344.

Add up all the costs:
$864 (removal) + $3,024 (new carpet and padding) + $7,344 (installation) = $11,232.

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11,232."
10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted Question:
Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and <fact3>more apples from the average trees</fact3>.

While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of <fact6>500 apples</fact6>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer:
Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1> and <fact2>15 apples from the shortest trees</fact2> (since it is half of 30). Let \( x \) be the number of apples she gathers from the average trees. Therefore, the number of apples Joanne gathers is \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).

Her sister gathers <fact4>twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees</fact4>, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples, and <fact5>3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees</fact5>, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

Thus, the total number of apples gathered by her sister is \( 60 + 45 = 105 \).

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is \( 45 + x + 105 = 500 \).

Simplifying gives \( x = 500 - 150 = 350 \).

Therefore, Joanne gathered <fact3>350 apples from the average trees</fact3>."

Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer:
First, convert the width of each flower from inches to feet: <fact3>12 inches</fact3> is equivalent to 1 foot. Each plant thus takes up <fact3>1 foot</fact3> + <fact4>1.5 feet</fact4> (the space required between each plant) = 2.5 feet of space. Therefore, the total number of plants needed to fill <fact1>111 feet</fact1> is <fact1>111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4, which rounds up to 45 plants because you cannot have a fraction of a plant. Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 45 - <fact2>17</fact2> = 28 plants. At a cost of <fact5>$6 per plant</fact5>, Pat will need to spend 28 plants * <fact5>$6</fact5> = $168. Thus, the answer is {168}."
12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"Reformatted Question: John decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>.

He also watched <fact5>3 different shows</fact5> which were <fact6>2 hours each</fact6>. How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: 
First, we calculate the time spent on activities that make up 30% of John's time. 
He spent <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and <fact4>half that time swimming</fact4>, which is 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. Therefore, he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours on boating and swimming. Additionally, he spent <fact5>3 different shows</fact5> x <fact6>2 hours each</fact6>, which is 6 hours on shows. In total, John spent 9 + 6 = 15 hours on activities which equals to <fact2>30% of the time</fact2>. 

Since 15 hours corresponds to 30% of his time, we can use this to find the full amount of time he had: 
Total time = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours.

John spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>, which equates to 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours. 

Therefore, the answer is {20}."

Blake runs back and forth <fact6>15 times</fact6>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Answer:
Kelly runs back and forth once on the <fact2>football field</fact2>, which means she runs <fact3>100 yards there</fact3> and then <fact3>100 yards back</fact3> for a total of 200 yards. Then she starts running to the <fact4>40-yard line</fact4> and back, which is a distance of <fact4>40 yards there</fact4> and <fact4>40 yards back</fact4>, totaling 80 yards per lap. She does this <fact5>34 times</fact5>, so she runs an additional 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. In total, Kelly runs 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Blake runs back and forth <fact6>15 times</fact6> on the <fact2>football field</fact2> that is <fact3>100 yards long</fact3>. Since each back and forth sprint equals 2 lengths of the football field, that means Blake runs 15 x 2 x 100 = 3000 yards.

Therefore, Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. Blake runs 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards farther than Kelly, making him the winner. The answer is {80}."

Jenny buys <fact1>1 bag of cookies a week</fact1>. Her husband eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>. The bag has <fact3>36 cookies</fact3> and she puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>. Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. How many cookies does Jenny eat?

Answer: Jenny buys a bag containing <fact3>36 cookies</fact3>. Her husband eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>, which amounts to 7 cookies. She puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>, totaling 4*5 = 20 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by her husband and used for her son's lunch is 7 + 20 = 27 cookies. Jenny eats the remaining cookies, which is <fact3>36 total cookies</fact3> - 27 = 9 cookies. So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted Question: A gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1> and cost <fact2>$12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: To determine how much it will cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls each have an area of <fact3>10 x 8</fact3> = 80 square feet, so together they total 80 + 80 = 160 square feet. The east and west walls each have an area of <fact4>5 x 8</fact4> = 40 square feet, so together they total 40 + 40 = 80 square feet. The total area to paint is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers <fact1>20 square feet</fact1>, the amount of paint needed is 240/<fact1>20</fact1> = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs <fact2>$12</fact2>, therefore the total cost for the paint is 12 * <fact2>$12</fact2> = $144. It will cost $144 to paint the room. The answer is {144}."

In the afternoon <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>. How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?

Answer: The hotel initially had <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. After <fact2>24 guests elected an early checkout</fact2>, there were 100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining. In the afternoon, <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>, resulting in 2 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 30 additional check-ins. This increased the total to 76 + 30 = 106 guests. Later, <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner was served</fact4>, which brought the total to 106 + 7 = 113 guests. Therefore, the hotel has 113 guests after dinner."

Answer: Brendan started with <fact1>10 marbles</fact1>. When he <fact2>tripped</fact2> and <fact3>dropped half of them</fact3>, he must have dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. He originally had 5 marbles left in his bag after dropping half. When he <fact5>picked up 3 in total</fact5>, one of them was actually a bead <fact4>that wasn't a marble</fact4>, which means he only picked up 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, he ended up with 5 marbles initially in the bag + 2 marbles picked up = 7 marbles. The answer is 7."
22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Certainly! Let's break down and tag the key elements of the question, followed by providing the answer with references:

**Reformatted Question:**
Today is <fact1>December 31st</fact1>. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact2>30 lbs</fact2>. by his birthday, which is <fact3>July 19th</fact3>. If Andy needs to burn <fact4>3500 calories</fact4> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

**Answer:**
To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs, we start with determining the timeframe from <fact1>December 31st</fact1> to <fact3>July 19th</fact3>.

1. **Determine the Timeframe:**  
   - January 1 to July 19 is 200 days (using typical month durations).
   
2. **Total Calories to be Burned:**  
   - Andy wants to lose <fact2>30 lbs</fact2>.
   - At <fact4>3500 calories</fact4> per pound, the total calories to be burned are 30 lbs x 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.

3. **Daily Caloric Deficit Needed:**  
   - To find out the daily deficit, divide the total calories by the total time frame.
   - 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy will need a daily caloric deficit of 525 calories per day to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th."

Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells <fact1>marigolds for $2.74 per pot</fact1>, <fact2>petunias for $1.87 per pot</fact2> and <fact3>begonias for $2.12 per pot</fact3>. If Artie sells <fact4>12 pots of marigolds</fact4>, <fact5>9 pots of petunias</fact5> and <fact6>17 pots of begonias</fact6>, how much will he make?

Answer: To calculate the total revenue, we need to round the prices and multiply by the number of pots sold. The price for marigolds is <fact1>$2.74, rounding this gives $3 per pot</fact1>. Artie sells <fact4>12 pots of marigolds</fact4>, so he will make 12 x 3 = $36 from marigolds. The price for petunias is <fact2>$1.87, rounding this gives $2 per pot</fact2>. Artie sells <fact5>9 pots of petunias</fact5>, so he will make 9 x 2 = $18 from petunias. The price for begonias is <fact3>$2.12, rounding this gives $2 per pot</fact3>. Artie sells <fact6>17 pots of begonias</fact6>, so he will make 17 x 2 = $34 from begonias. Therefore, the total revenue is $36 + $18 + $34 = $88. Artie will make {88} dollars."

Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If <fact3>Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls</fact3>, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?

Answer: Based on <fact3>Jason carrying 2 balls</fact3>, <fact2>Jeffrey would have carried half that amount</fact2>, so Jeffrey carried 1 ball. <fact1>Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason</fact1>, so Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that all three boys carried would be Jason's 2 balls + Jeffrey's 1 ball + Jordan's 4 balls = 7 balls. Thus, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice was 7. The answer is {7}."

On <fact10>days one and two</fact10>, Mack saw a <fact11>total of 50 birds</fact11>. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?

Answer:
To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to determine the total number of birds he saw and divide that by the number of days, which is <fact1>7 days</fact1>.

From <fact10>days one and two</fact10>, Mack saw a <fact11>total of 50 birds</fact11>. On <fact2>day three</fact2>, he saw <fact3>none</fact3>. On <fact4>days four and five</fact4>, he saw a total of <fact5>120 birds</fact5>. On <fact6>day six</fact6>, he saw <fact7>20 birds</fact7> and on <fact8>day seven</fact8>, he saw <fact9>90 birds</fact9>.

The total number of birds Mack saw is:
- From days one and two: 50 birds
- Plus none on day three: 0 birds
- Plus from days four and five: 120 birds
- Plus on day six: 20 birds
- Plus on day seven: 90 birds

This sums up to 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds over the <fact1>week</fact1>.

To calculate the average:
280 birds over <fact1>7 days</fact1> gives an average of 280 / 7 = 40 birds per day.

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day. The answer is {40}."

If his <fact5>farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, we calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- The sugar cubes weigh <fact1>2 boxes</fact1> * 1 pound = 2 pounds.
- The oats weigh <fact2>20 sacks</fact2> * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds.
- The hay weighs <fact3>42 bales</fact3> * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds.
- The carrots weigh <fact4>4 bags</fact4> * 12 pounds = 48 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4500 pounds.

Given that the <fact5>farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</fact5>, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed: 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 2 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. The answer is {2}."

Given that there are 7 days in a week, this means he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches. He used <fact2>8 slices of cheese in his big dish of macaroni and cheese</fact2>. For the omelets, he used <fact3>3 days in the week</fact3> and <fact4>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</fact4>, so he used 3 * (2 + 1) = 9 slices for the omelets. In total, Carl used 14 + 8 + 9 = 31 slices of cheese. Therefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese. The answer is {31}."
36,"Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the first race, he lost $5. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","Reformatted Question:
Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the second race, he won <fact1>$1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact1>. On the first race, he lost <fact2>$5</fact2>. On the third race, he lost <fact3>1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact3>. How much did he lose on average that day?

Answer:
To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to assess his gains and losses based on the information provided in the question.

First, according to <fact2>the first race fact</fact2>, he lost $5.

In the second race, <fact1>the fact indicates he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact1>. Therefore, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

For the third race, <fact3>he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact3>. Therefore, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

To calculate the average daily loss, we need to first calculate the total amount he lost over the three races. In total, he lost $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (won in the second race) = $10.50.

Since there were three races, to find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.50 per race that day. The answer is $3.50."
37,James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants.  The suits cost $750 each and the dress pants cost 1/5 that cost.  He also buys 3 dress shirts per suit.  The dress shirts were $60 each.  How much did everything cost?,"Reformatted Question: James buys a new wardrobe. He buys <fact1>10 suits</fact1> and <fact2>10 dress pants</fact2>. The suits cost <fact3>$750 each</fact3> and the dress pants cost <fact4>1/5 that cost</fact4>. He also buys <fact5>3 dress shirts per suit</fact5>. The dress shirts were <fact6>$60 each</fact6>. How much did everything cost?

Answer: 
- The cost of the suits is <fact1>10 suits</fact1> * <fact3>$750 per suit</fact3> = $7,500.
- The cost of the dress pants is <fact2>10 dress pants</fact2> * (<fact3>$750 per suit</fact3> / <fact4>5</fact4>) = $1,500.
- James buys <fact5>3 dress shirts per suit</fact5>, which totals 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. 
- The cost of the dress shirts is 30 dress shirts * <fact6>$60 each</fact6> = $1,800.

Therefore, the total cost is $7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts) = $10,800.

The answer is {10,800}."

He gives <fact5>2 sugar cookies to his friends</fact5>. Then, he bakes <fact6>4 of each flavor</fact6> for dinner. He ate <fact7>2 oatmeal cookies for lunch</fact7>. How many cookies does he have now?

Answer:
Initially, Randy has a total of <fact1>9 oatmeal cookies</fact1> + <fact2>4 chocolate chip cookies</fact2> + <fact3>5 sugar cookies</fact3> = 18 cookies. After eating <fact4>3 cookies</fact4> for an early day snack (one of each flavor), he has 8 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies left.

After giving away <fact5>2 sugar cookies</fact5>, he has 2 sugar cookies left. 

Then he bakes <fact6>4 of each flavor</fact6> for dinner, totaling 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies. Adding these to the remaining cookies:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 (after snack) + 4 (baked) = 12 oatmeal cookies
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (after snack) + 4 (baked) = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- Sugar cookies: 2 (after giving away) + 4 (baked) = 6 sugar cookies.

After eating <fact7>2 oatmeal cookies</fact7> for lunch, he has 12 - 2 = 10 oatmeal cookies left.

In total, Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies + 7 chocolate chip cookies + 6 sugar cookies = 23 cookies. The answer is {23}."

40,A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"**Reformatted Question:**

A new arcade opens up and <fact1>Jack</fact1> decides to play with his <fact2>3 friends</fact2>. Jack can play a game with <fact3>1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact3>. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play <fact4>half as long</fact4>. They play for <fact5>4 hours</fact5>. One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact6>1.5 times as long</fact6>. How much money is used?

**Answer:**

Jack can play for <fact5>4 hours</fact5> which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. At a rate of <fact3>1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact3>, Jack needs 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Each of his two worse friends can play for <fact4>half as long</fact4> as Jack. So, they can play for 240/2 = 120 minutes each. At a rate of <fact3>1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact3>, each requires 120 / 20 = 6 quarters. Therefore, the two worse friends together use 6 + 6 = 12 quarters.

His better friend can play for <fact6>1.5 times as long</fact6> as Jack. So, this friend can play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. At a rate of <fact3>1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact3>, the better friend needs 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Thus, the total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 12 (two worse friends) + 18 (better friend) = 42 quarters. Since each quarter is equivalent to 0.25 dollars, the total money used is 42 * 0.25 = $10.50.

The answer is {10.50}."
41,Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"Reformatted Question:  
Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions. He has <fact1>600 movies</fact1>. <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series</fact2> are <fact3>older movies which are $5</fact3>. <fact4>A third of the movies are in various series</fact4> and he knows he can get those for only <fact5>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact5> by just buying the series together. How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs <fact6>$10</fact6>?

Answer:  
First, calculate the number of series movies:  
The problem stated that <fact4>a third</fact4> of the <fact1>600 movies</fact1> are in series:  
600 * 1/3 = 200 series movies.

Next, calculate the cost to replace the series movies:  
The series movies can be replaced for <fact5>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact5> which means $6:  
200 series movies * $6/movie = $1,200.

Now, calculate the number of non-series movies:  
600 total movies - 200 series movies = 400 non-series movies.

Determine the number of older non-series movies:  
According to the problem, <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series</fact2> are older movies:  
400 * 0.4 = 160 older non-series movies.

Calculate the cost to replace the older non-series movies:  
The older movies are given at <fact3>$5</fact3>:  
160 older movies * $5/movie = $800.

Calculate the number of regular-priced non-series movies:  
400 non-series movies - 160 older movies = 240 regular-priced non-series movies.

Calculate the cost to replace the regular-priced non-series movies:  
The cost of replacing a regular movie is <fact6>$10</fact6>:  
240 regular-priced movies * $10/movie = $2,400.

Add up the total cost for replacing all movies:  
Total replacement cost = $1,200 (series movies) + $800 (older movies) + $2,400 (regular-priced movies) = $4,400.

Thus, the final total cost to replace all of Mike's movies is $4,400. The answer is {4400}."

Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>25%</fact4> of the students are cheerleaders or part of band. How many students are leaving early?

Answer: First, determine how many football players there are in the class. There are <fact1>30 students</fact1>, and <fact2>20%</fact2> of them are football players. That means there are 30 * 0.20 = 6 football players. These 6 students will leave early.

Answer:
On the first day, Wanda filled <fact1>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact1>, which is <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> x 1/4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4 as much water as Wanda</fact2> that day, which is 4500 gallons x 3/4 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact3>, which is 4500 gallons x 2/3 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact4>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact4>, which is 3375 gallons x 1/3 = 1125 gallons.

In total, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons over the two days. The tank's capacity is <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5>, so the number of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons. The answer is 6000."

How much does he produce the fourth week?
                    
Answer:
To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, subtract the amount produced in the first, second, and third weeks from the total monthly production:

- In the first week, Boris produces <fact4>8,000 bars</fact4>.
- In the second week, he produces <fact2>half of the first week's amount</fact2>, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
- In the third week, he produces <fact3>three times the first week's amount</fact3>, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Add the production amounts of the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

The total monthly production is <fact1>50,000 bars</fact1>. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars."

What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer: Let the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park be \(x\% \). For the first <fact3>5 hours</fact3>, the power bank lost <fact1>9%</fact1> of its capacity each hour, totaling a loss of \(9 \times 5 = 45%\). Thus, the charge after 5 hours would be \(x - 45\%\).

For the next <fact5>3 hours</fact5>, the power bank lost <fact4>7% of the capacity each hour</fact4>, totaling a loss of \(7 \times 3 = 21%\). Thus, the remaining charge after the last 3 hours would be \((x - 45\%) - 21\%\).

We know at this point, the charge remaining was <fact2>28%\). Therefore, we can use the equation:

\[
(x - 45) - 21 = 28

\[
x = 28 + 66

\[
x = 94

Answer:
- Initially, Rose picks <fact1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</fact1>, totaling 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
- She then picks <fact2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</fact2>, totaling 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
- She adds <fact3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</fact3>, totaling 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
- At this point, she has a total of 15 + 24 + 20 = 59 petals.
- But she drops <fact4>1 of each</fact4> type of these flowers, which means she loses 1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 4 = 15 petals.

They can fit <fact3>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact3>. They also have <fact4>10 boxes of stuff already</fact4>. If they already own <fact5>15 tables</fact5>, how many new tables do they need?

Answer: The total number of boxes donated is <fact1>10 people</fact1> x <fact2>5 boxes each</fact2> = 50 boxes. They also have an additional <fact4>10 boxes</fact4> already. Therefore, the total number of boxes they have is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes. With <fact3>2 boxes per table</fact3>, they require 60 / 2 = 30 tables. Since they already own <fact5>15 tables</fact5>, they need an additional 30 - 15 = 15 new tables. The answer is {15}."
53,"Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","Reformatted Question:
Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to <fact1>gather some seashells</fact1>. They gathered all their seashells and <fact2>divided them equally</fact2> between themselves. Before gathering, <fact3>Jim collected 27 seashells</fact3>, which was <fact4>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact4>. <fact5>Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact5>. How many did each person get?

Answer:
From the question, we know:
1. Jim collected <fact3>27 seashells</fact3>.
2. ""5 more than what Carlos collected"" means Carlos collected 27 - <fact4>5</fact4> = 22 seashells.
3. And since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey (i.e., <fact5>Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact5>), Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells gathered by all three is 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells. These are evenly divided among the three people, so each person gets 60 / <fact2>3</fact2> = 20 seashells.

The answer is that each person gets 20 seashells."

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Answer:
According to <fact1>, Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive. According to <fact2>, half of these bees returned during the next 6 hours, so 30/2 = 15 bees returned during that time. Thus, the remaining bees that had not yet returned and would return in the last 6 hours would be the original number of bees that left (30) minus the number that already returned during the previous period (15), giving 30 - 15 = 15 bees. According to <fact3>, these remaining 15 bees return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, Debra saw 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."

Mr. Tan paid the transfer fees that amount to <fact1>3% of the selling price</fact1> and also paid a brokerage fee that is <fact2>5% of the selling price</fact2>.

Answer:  
To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to subtract the total costs from the selling price. The selling price is <fact3>$400,000</fact3>. He paid transfer fees of <fact1>3% of $400,000</fact1>, which is 0.03 * <fact3>$400,000</fact3> = $12,000. He also paid a brokerage fee of <fact2>5% of $400,000</fact2>, which is 0.05 * <fact3>$400,000</fact3> = $20,000. Additionally, he paid <fact4>$250,000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount.  

The total costs are $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fees) + <fact4>$250,000</fact4> (remaining loan) = $282,000.  

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds are calculated as the selling price minus the total costs: <fact3>$400,000</fact3> - $282,000 = $118,000.  

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the <wolf7>three wolves</wolf7>' howls?

Answer:
Let the time Tobias howls be \( T \) seconds. According to <wolf4>Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</wolf4>, Chikote howls for \( 2T \) seconds. As stated in <wolf5>Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</wolf5>, Igneous howls for \( T + 2T = 3T \) seconds.

The total time the <wolf7>three wolves</wolf7> howl is given by:
\[ T + 2T + 3T = 6T \]

According to <wolf6>When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds</wolf6>, \( T = 20 \) seconds. Substituting, we get:
\[ 6T = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Converting the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The combined length of time, in minutes, of the <wolf7>three wolves</wolf7>' howls is \( 2 \) minutes."

Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: The shirt's original price is <fact2>$25</fact2>, and with a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3>, the discount is 0.30 * 25 = $7.50. So, the sale price of the shirt is 25 - 7.50 = $17.50. The pair of shorts costs <fact4>$35</fact4>. Therefore, the total cost for the outfit is 17.50 + 35 = $52.50. Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1>, and since the total cost of $52.50 exceeds the amount he has, he is unable to make this purchase if sales tax is included. However, if it is within the $50 budget, then after buying the shirt and shorts, he would have 50 - 52.50 = -$2.50, indicating he is short by $2.50 and will have $0 remaining assuming all costs had to be within the budget."

If she has <fact4>110 books</fact4>, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Answer:
Each middle shelf holds <fact3>10 books</fact3>. Therefore, two middle shelves collectively hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. According to <fact1>, the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. With <fact2>, the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books. Adding these up, one bookcase can hold 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books. With Elly having <fact4>110 books</fact4>, she would need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases to store all her books. Therefore, the answer is 2 bookcases."

She put both of these purchases on her credit card. The <fact2>returned item</fact2> cost <fact7>$15.00</fact7>. What is the new balance on her credit card?

Answer:
Sheila initially charged <fact1>$85.00 worth of merchandise</fact1> on her credit card. She returned an item costing <fact7>$15.00</fact7>, which decreases her balance by this amount. After returning the item, her balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Sheila bought a frying pan that was <fact4>on sale for 20% off $20.00</fact4>. The discount on the frying pan is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, she paid $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan.

She also bought a set of towels that was <fact6>10% off $30.00</fact6>. The discount on the towels is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Therefore, she paid $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the towels.

Sheila put both the frying pan and the towels on her credit card, which adds $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00 to her balance. Therefore, her new credit card balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00."

Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her <fact4>$400,000 budget</fact4>. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?

Answer:
First, calculate the brokerage fee which is <fact2>5%</fact2> of the selling price: <fact1>$350,000</fact1> * 0.05 = $17,500.  
Next, calculate the transfer fee which is <fact3>12%</fact3> of the selling price: <fact1>$350,000</fact1> * 0.12 = $42,000.  
The total price of the house, including the selling price and additional fees, is <fact1>$350,000</fact1> + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.  
Now, find out how much more this total is than Mrs. Cruz's budget: $409,500 - <fact4>$400,000</fact4> = $9,500.

A blog article takes an average of <fact1>4 hours</fact1> to research and write about. Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

She wrote <fact4>5 articles on Monday</fact4> and <fact5>2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact5>. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.  
  
Answer:  
First, calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. According to the problem, she wrote <fact5>2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact5>. Thus, she wrote <fact4>5 articles on Monday</fact4> + (2/5) * 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

Next, calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday. She wrote <fact3>twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact3>, which amounts to 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:  
<fact4>5 articles on Monday</fact4> + 7 articles on Tuesday + 14 articles on <fact2>Wednesday</fact2> = 26 articles.

Finally, calculate the total number of hours spent writing these articles. Since each article takes <fact1>4 hours</fact1>, we have:  
26 articles * <fact1>4 hours</fact1> per article = 104 hours.

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over the three days."

Tom collected <fact3>30 points less than Betty</fact3>, therefore Tom collected 65 - 30 = 35 points. Martha collected <fact2>3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, so Martha collected 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is the sum of the points from Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom:
- Adam: <fact1>50 points</fact1>
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Thus, the total is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points. The minimum threshold to go on the trip is <fact5>400 points</fact5>, so the class is short by 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Therefore, the class is missing 145 points. The answer is {145}."

Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out <fact1>17 fish</fact1> out of a mixed tank of both <fact2>white</fact2> and <fact3>orange</fact3> fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <fact4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact4>. Bob started with <fact5>7 fish in his pond</fact5>. <fact6>3 were orange</fact6>, and <fact7>4 were white</fact7>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Answer: Bob initially had <fact6>3 orange fish</fact6> and <fact7>4 white fish</fact7>. After buying <fact1>17 fish</fact1>, he had a total of <fact5>7 fish before</fact5> + 17 fish = 24 fish. Let x represent the number of white fish Bob bought at the store. Therefore, he bought (17 - x) orange fish. Adding these to the original count, the total number of orange fish is <fact6>3 orange</fact6> + (17 - x), and the total number of white fish is <fact7>4 white</fact7> + x. According to the condition <fact4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact4>, we can write: 3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x). Simplifying this equation: 20 - x = 8 + 2x, solve for x: 20 - 8 = 2x + x, 12 = 3x, x = 4. Thus, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store."

Answer:
Last year, Leo collected <fact4>50 stickers</fact4>. This year, he collected <fact2>twice the number of stickers</fact2> as the <fact3>previous year</fact3>, meaning he collected 2 * <fact4>50 stickers</fact4> = 100 stickers this year.

73,"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Reformatted Question:
A toy manufacturer receives an order for <fact1>400 toys</fact1>. <fact2>5 workers</fact2> are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another <fact4>20 toys</fact4> to be able to ship the order. <fact5>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, and <fact6>another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer:
First, calculate the total number of toys produced by all workers combined during the shift. Since the manufacturer still needs <fact4>20 toys</fact4>, the workers collectively produced <fact1>400 toys</fact1> - <fact4>20 toys</fact4> = 380 toys.

Calculate the contribution of the first 4 workers:
The 2 workers each producing <fact5>6 toys an hour</fact5> make 2 x 6 toys/hour x <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 120 toys.
The other 2 workers each producing <fact6>4 toys an hour</fact6> make 2 x 4 toys/hour x <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 80 toys.

Combined, these 4 workers produce 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Knowing that the total number of toys produced is 380, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produced: 180 toys / <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 18 toys per hour.

The answer is {18}."

After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

Answer:
To find the total final price of Stephen's groceries including all the extra fees, we first need to add the tip to his final bill. The bill before the percentage fee and delivery charge is <fact1>$40.00</fact1> + <fact2>$4.00 tip</fact2> = $44.00. Next, apply the <fact3>25% fee</fact3> to the previously calculated amount: 25% of $44.00 is $44.00 * 0.25 = $11.00. Adding this to the bill gives $44.00 + $11.00 = $55.00. Finally, add the <fact4>$3.00 delivery fee</fact4>: $55.00 + $3.00 = $58.00. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all extra fees is $58.00."

How many questions does she need to get right on the <fact6>second test</fact6> to move onto the 7th grade?

Answer:
To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to pass, we first calculate her performance on the first test and then establish the total correct answers required.

For the first test:
- Audrey answered <fact3>70 questions</fact3> and got <fact4>60%</fact4> correct. Thus, she got (70 * 0.60) = 42 questions correct.

For the total questions:
- Combined, the first and second tests have <fact3>70 questions</fact3> + <fact2>40 questions</fact2> = 110 questions.

To pass, she must correctly answer <fact5>70%</fact5> of these total questions. That amounts to (110 * 0.70) = 77 questions.

Since she already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she must answer correctly on the second test is:
77 (total correct needed) - 42 (already correct) = 35 questions.

Thus, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move on to the 7th grade."

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"Reformatted Question:

Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is <fact1>0.15 cubic inches</fact1>. He also knows that they get about <fact2>80% efficiency in packing</fact2>. He estimates <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>. The jar has a square base and is <fact4>6 inches by 6 inches</fact4> and <fact5>15 inches tall</fact5>. The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact6>900</fact6>.

Answer:

First, calculate the total volume of the jar which has a square base: <fact4>6 inches by 6 inches</fact4> and <fact5>15 inches tall</fact5>. The volume is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches. 

Considering the <fact2>80% efficiency in packing</fact2>, the effective volume for the jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean occupies <fact1>0.15 cubic inches</fact1>. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans that can fit is 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Assuming <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

Given the true number of red jelly beans is <fact6>900</fact6>, Tim's guess is off by 900 - 864 = 36.

Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered <fact1>four times as many red roses as white carnations</fact1>. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered <fact2>200 pink calla lilies</fact2>, which were <fact3>five times the number of white carnations</fact3>. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?

Answer:
We need to find out how many red roses Sandra ordered, which is based on the number of white carnations she ordered. According to the information:

1. The pink calla lilies ordered were five times the number of white carnations: <fact2>200 pink calla lilies</fact2> were ordered, which were <fact3>five times the number of white carnations</fact3>. Therefore, the number of white carnations (W) is 200 / 5 = 40.

2. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations: Let the number of red roses (R) be four times the number of white carnations: R = <fact1>four times as many red roses as white carnations</fact1> = 4 * W = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm."

Sidney ordered <fact1>3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches</fact1>. One meatball sub sandwich contains <fact2>4 meatballs</fact2>. Then Mark ate <fact3>4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches</fact3>. So Sidney ordered <fact4>another three sub sandwiches</fact4>. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?

Answer:
Sidney initially ordered <fact1>10 - 3 = 7</fact1> meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub contains <fact2>4 meatballs</fact2>, the total number of meatballs in the initial order was <fact1>7</fact1> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 28 meatballs. Mark ate <fact3>4 sub sandwiches</fact3>, which equals <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 16 meatballs eaten. Sidney then ordered <fact4>another 3 sub sandwiches</fact4>, which contain <fact4>3</fact4> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 12 meatballs. After accounting for the meatballs Mark ate and the additional sandwiches Sidney ordered, the remaining meatballs are calculated as follows: (28 initial meatballs - 16 eaten meatballs + 12 new meatballs), resulting in 24 meatballs in the sandwiches that remained. Therefore, the answer is {24}."

John drives to his friend's house. He drives at a speed of <fact1>70 mph</fact1>. He had to take a detour that added <fact2>10 miles</fact2> to his trip. After he gets there he takes a route home that is <fact3>240 miles</fact3> but he goes <fact4>80 mph</fact4>. The friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5> away. How long did the trip take?

Answer:
To calculate how long the trip took, we need to determine the time taken for both the trip to and from his friend's house.

1. **Trip to the friend's house**:  
   The original distance to the friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5>. With an added detour of <fact2>10 miles</fact2>, the total distance becomes 200 + 10 = 210 miles.  
   Driving at a speed of <fact1>70 mph</fact1>, the time taken for this journey is 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

2. **Trip back home**:  
   The return route is <fact3>240 miles</fact3>, and John drives at a speed of <fact4>80 mph</fact4>.  
   The time taken for the return journey is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

3. **Total trip time**:  
   The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time going to the friend's house and the time returning home, which is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Therefore, the total trip took 6 hours. The answer is {6 hours}."

Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between <fact1>tattered jeans</fact1> and <fact2>jogger jeans</fact2>. The tattered jeans cost <fact3>$28</fact3> while the jogger jeans cost <fact4>$6 less than the tattered jeans</fact4>. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of <fact5>$6</fact5>. If he saved <fact6>1/3</fact6> of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Answer:
The jogger jeans cost <fact3>$28</fact3> - <fact4>$6 less than the tattered jeans</fact4> = $22. Cole saved a total of <fact5>$6</fact5>. So, if 1/3 of the savings is from the jogger jeans, this means he saved <fact5>$6</fact5> * <fact6>1/3</fact6> = $2 from the jogger jeans. The remaining savings from the tattered jeans would be $6 - $2 = $4. Since saving from the jogger jeans is $2, the original price of the jogger jeans would have been $22 + $2 = $24. The tattered jeans were $28, so jogger jeans were originally $28 - $24 = $4 less than the tattered jeans. Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and they cost $4 less, the answer is {-4}."

Martha is knitting winter wear for her <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1>. It takes <fact2>2 skeins</fact2> of wool to make a hat, <fact3>4</fact3> for a scarf, <fact4>12</fact4> for a sweater, <fact5>1</fact5> for a pair of mittens, and <fact6>2</fact6> for a pair of socks. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her <fact1>grandchildren</fact1>. They're triplets, so they're all the same size.

Answer:  
Martha needs to make each item for her <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1>. For the hats, she'll need <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> x <fact2>2 skeins per hat</fact2> = 6 skeins. For the scarves, she'll need <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> x <fact3>4 skeins per scarf</fact3> = 12 skeins. For the sweaters, she'll need <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> x <fact4>12 skeins per sweater</fact4> = 36 skeins. For the mittens, she'll need <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> x <fact5>1 skein per pair of mittens</fact5> = 3 skeins.

Answer:
The total amount raised by the charity is <fact1>$175,000</fact1>. According to the data, <fact2>$50,000</fact2> of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 (total raised) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000. Since there are twenty students who each raised the same amount, the total $125,000 raised by students is divided equally. Thus, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. The answer is {6250}."

How many <fact8>5 dollar bills</fact8> does he have?

Answer:
First, determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially had by dividing <fact1>$1000</fact1> by <fact2>$20 per bill</fact2>, which equals 50 bills. 

After paying for a bill, he uses <fact4>half of the remaining bills</fact4>, or 50/2 = 25 bills. This leaves him with 25 bills. 

Thomas then <fact5>triples his money</fact5>, which means he now effectively has 25 * 3 = 75 bills worth $20 each, totaling $1500. 

He then <fact6>converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills</fact6>. For $1500, he will have $1500 / <fact8>$5</fact8> = 300 bills. 

Finally, he <fact7>lost 10 bills</fact7> while getting home, so he has 300 - 10 = 290 bills left. 

Therefore, Thomas has 290 <fact8>5 dollar bills</fact8>. The answer is {290}."

He gets charged <fact5>$2 per mile driven</fact5> and he also gives his driver <fact6>a $150 bonus per month</fact6>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer:
The distance John travels each day is <fact4>30 miles to work</fact4> and <fact4>30 miles back home</fact4>, totaling 60 miles per day. Over the course of a week, he travels 60 miles/day * <fact3>5 days</fact3> = 300 miles each week. For the year, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Answer: Shawnda inflated <fact1>5 bicycles</fact1> * <fact2>2 tires per bicycle</fact2> = 10 bicycle tires. She inflated <fact3>3 tricycles</fact3> * <fact4>3 tires per tricycle</fact4> = 9 tricycle tires. She also inflated <fact5>1 unicycle</fact5> * 1 = 1 unicycle tire. In total, Shawnda inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Since each tire costs <fact6>0.25 dollars</fact6> to inflate, she made 20 * 0.25 = $5.00 from inflating tires that day. The answer is {5}."

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Reformatted Question:

Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a <normal_teacher_extension_chance>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</normal_teacher_extension_chance>. There's a <substitute_teacher_chance>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher</substitute_teacher_chance> who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <dog_ate_assignment_chance>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment</dog_ate_assignment_chance> and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer:

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the likelihood of all scenarios in which he is not required to submit his work.

1. **If the normal teacher gives an extension**, there's a <normal_teacher_extension_chance>40% chance</normal_teacher_extension_chance> of this happening.
2. **If there is a substitute teacher**, there's a <substitute_teacher_chance>50% chance</substitute_teacher_chance> she won't collect the homework.
3. **If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, Marcus can still get a personal extension** with a <dog_ate_assignment_chance>20% chance</dog_ate_assignment_chance>. This scenario only applies if he hasn't already been covered by either the class-wide extension from the normal teacher or had a substitute teacher.

**Calculating the chance that Marcus doesn’t have to turn it in:**
- **Scenario with a substitute teacher** (50% chance), which means he doesn't need to do anything regardless of extensions.
- **Normal teacher giving an extension** (40% chance) also means homework doesn't need to be turned in.
- **Normal teacher does NOT give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate it:** First, multiply the chance of the normal teacher coming without giving an extension to the class, which is (1 - <normal_teacher_extension_chance>40%) = 60%. Then, multiply this by the personal excuse success rate of <dog_ate_assignment_chance>20%</dog_ate_assignment_chance>: 60% * 20% = 12%.

The combined chance that Marcus does not need to turn in his homework is calculated as follows: 
= <substitute_teacher_chance>50%</substitute_teacher_chance> (substitute scenario) 
+ (1 - <substitute_teacher_chance>50%) * <normal_teacher_extension_chance>40%</normal_teacher_extension_chance> (normal teacher gives extension)
+ (1 - <substitute_teacher_chance>50%) * (1 - <normal_teacher_extension_chance>40%) * <dog_ate_assignment_chance>20%</dog_ate_assignment_chance> (no class-wide extension, personal excuse works)

= 50%
+ 0.5 * 40% 
+ 0.5 * 60% * 20% 

= 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

Thus, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of this probability: 
100% - 76% = 24%.

Therefore, there is a 24% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow."
112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted Question: Lorraine and Colleen are trading <trade1>stickers for buttons</trade1>. Each large sticker is worth a <equivalence1>large button or three small buttons</equivalence1>. A small sticker is worth <equivalence2>one small button</equivalence2>. A large button is worth <equivalence3>three small stickers</equivalence3>. Lorraine starts with <initial1>30 small stickers</initial1> and <initial2>40 large stickers</initial2>. She trades <trade2>50% of her large stickers</trade2> for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <trade3>90% of her small stickers</trade3> for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: Lorraine starts with <initial1>30 small stickers</initial1> and <initial2>40 large stickers</initial2>. She trades <trade2>50% of her large stickers</trade2> for large buttons, so she trades 40/2 = 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons (since each large sticker is worth a <equivalence1>large button</equivalence1>). She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons, getting 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons (since each large sticker is worth <equivalence1>three small buttons</equivalence1>). She trades <trade3>90% of her small stickers</trade3> for large buttons, which equals 0.90 x 30 = 27 small stickers for the equivalent large buttons. Each large button is worth <equivalence3>three small stickers</equivalence3>, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons. By the end, Lorraine has 20 (from trading large stickers for large buttons) + 9 (from trading small stickers for large buttons) = 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining 20 large stickers. Therefore, Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons by the end."

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact5>20% cost per frame</fact5>. <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers and they will need to receive cords that are <fact7>$12</fact7> each. How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer: The total cost for the <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> to receive picture frames is calculated as 44 seniors * <fact4>$20</fact4> = $880. The etching cost is <fact5>20%</fact5> of $880, which is $880 * 0.20 = $176. Therefore, the total cost for picture frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Additionally, <fact2>2 of the seniors</fact2> will receive pins costing <fact3>$5</fact3> each, so 2 * $5 = $10.

Since <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers, we calculate 44 * (1/4) = 11 officers. The cost of cords for these officers is 11 * <fact7>$12</fact7> = $132.

Adding these costs together gives $1056 (frames + etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

Hence, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198. The answer is {1198}."

Answer: 
Mike writes letters to <fact2>5 people</fact2> - <fact3>2 people</fact3> = 3 people now. He writes <fact4>2 letters a week</fact4> to each of these 3 pen pals, i.e., 3 * <fact4>2</fact4> = 6 letters each week. Each letter is <fact5>5 pages long</fact5>, so Mike writes 6 * <fact5>5</fact5> = 30 pages each week. He writes a page every <fact1>6 minutes</fact1>, so for 30 pages, it takes 30 * <fact1>6</fact1> = 180 minutes. In hours, 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

James buys a plane. He pays <fact1>$5000 a month</fact1> to rent a hanger to keep it in. He also spends <fact2>twice as much as that on fuel</fact2> per month. The plane <fact3>cost $150,000</fact3>. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the <fact4>first year</fact4>?

Answer:
To calculate the total cost for the first year, we consider each of the expenses:
1. The cost of the plane itself is <fact3>$150,000</fact3>.
2. The monthly hanger rental expense is <fact1>$5000</fact1> per month. For a year, this amounts to <fact1>$5000</fact1> * 12 months = $60,000.
3. The monthly fuel cost is <fact2>twice as much as</fact2> the hanger rental, so $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. For a year, this amounts to $10,000 * 12 months = $120,000.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
Plane cost: <fact3>$150,000</fact3>
Hanger rental cost for a year: $60,000
Fuel cost for a year: $120,000

Thus, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000. The answer is {330,000}."

When James came back yet again, <fact4>3 dogs were gone</fact4> so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?

Answer:
Initially, there are <fact1>4 toys for 4 dogs</fact1>, which means each dog has a toy. James then needs toys for <fact2>8 more dogs</fact2>, so he buys 8 toys. After buying the toys, James sees twice as many dogs. Originally, there were 4 existing dogs + 8 new dogs = 12 dogs. So, <fact3>twice as many more dogs</fact3> means 12 new dogs arrived, totaling 24 dogs. James originally had enough toys for 12 dogs (4 existing + 8 new), so he needed 12 more toys to cover the additional 12 dogs. When <fact4>3 dogs were gone</fact4>, he no longer needed 3 toys, reducing the total need by 3.

129,Tom plants 10 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?,"Reformatted Question: Tom plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1>. He starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2>. After <fact3>10 years</fact3>, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>. Every year, he also chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5>. How many trees does he have left?

Answer: Tom starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2> and plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, totaling 10 * 10 = 100 trees planted. Therefore, he initially has 50 + 100 = 150 trees. Over those 10 years, he chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5>, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees in total. This leaves him with 150 - 20 = 130 trees. After <fact3>10 years</fact3>, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>, which equals 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees dying. Therefore, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left."
130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","Reformatted Question:
Mr. Smith has two farms, <fact1>Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>Farm Y</fact2>. He sold <fact3>10 goats</fact3> from <fact1>Farm X</fact1> and <fact4>twice as many goats</fact4> from <fact2>Farm Y</fact2>. He has <fact5>55 goats</fact5> in <fact1>Farm X</fact1> and <fact6>45 goats</fact6> in <fact2>Farm Y</fact2>. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?

Answer:
Initially, <fact1>Farm X</fact1> had <fact5>55 goats</fact5>. After selling <fact3>10 goats</fact3>, there are 55 - 10 = 45 goats left in <fact1>Farm X</fact1>. 

<fact1>Farm Y</fact1> originally had <fact6>45 goats</fact6>. Since <fact4>twice as many goats</fact4> were sold from <fact1>Farm Y</fact1> as <fact3>10 goats</fact3> from <fact1>Farm X</fact1>, 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold from <fact2>Farm Y</fact2>. Therefore, there are 45 - 20 = 25 goats left in <fact2>Farm Y</fact2>.

Adding the goats left in both farms: 45 goats in <fact1>Farm X</fact1> + 25 goats in <fact2>Farm Y</fact2> = 70 goats left altogether. Therefore, Mr. Smith has 70 goats left in total across the two farms. The answer is {70}."
131,"John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  He sells planks for $1.2 each. He can make logs out of 80% of the tree. From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  How much does he make?","Reformatted Question:
John cuts down an <fact1>80-foot tree</fact1>. He cuts it into <fact2>4-foot logs</fact2>. He sells planks for <fact3>$1.2 each</fact3>. He can make logs out of <fact4>80% of the tree</fact4>. From each of those logs, he cuts <fact5>5 planks</fact5>. How much does he make?

Answer:
First, find the total usable length of the tree to make logs by multiplying the tree's length by the percentage that can be used: <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact4>0.80</fact4> = 64 feet.

Now, determine the number of logs by dividing the usable length by the length of each log: 64 / <fact2>4</fact2> = 16 logs.

Next, calculate the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by the number of planks per log: 16 * <fact5>5</fact5> = 80 planks.

Finally, calculate the total amount of money made by multiplying the total number of planks by the price of each plank: 80 * <fact3>1.2</fact3> = $96.

The answer is {96}."

The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"Reformatted Question:

Each muffaletta sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1> and would <fact2>serve 4 people</fact2>. Tyson decided to <fact3>make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game</fact3>. The meat cost <fact4>$7.00 per pound</fact4> and the cheese cost <fact5>$3.00 per pound</fact5>. There would be <fact6>20 people</fact6> in total watching the game. How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?

Answer:

To serve <fact6>20 people</fact6> and considering that each muffaletta sandwich would <fact2>serve 4 people</fact2>, Tyson needs to make 20/<fact2>4</fact2> = 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 * <fact1>1 pound</fact1> = 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. 

The total cost for the meat is 5 pounds * <fact4>$7.00 per pound</fact4> = $35.00. The total cost for the cheese is 5 pounds * <fact5>$3.00 per pound</fact5> = $15.00. 

Thus, the total cost for meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00. Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
133,Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?  

Answer: First, we identify the number of eggs each person found. Since <eggs_hidden>3 dozen eggs</eggs_hidden> refers to 36 eggs, these are the total eggs hidden.  Lamar finds <lamar_found>5 eggs</lamar_found>. Stacy finds <stacy_found>twice as many as Lamar</stacy_found>, so Stacy finds 2 * <lamar_found>5</lamar_found> = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <charlie_found>2 less than Stacy</charlie_found>, so Charlie finds <stacy_found>10</stacy_found> - <charlie_found>2</charlie_found> = 8 eggs. Mei finds <mei_found>half as many as Charlie</mei_found>, so Mei finds <charlie_found>8</charlie_found>/2 = 4 eggs. Therefore, Lamar, Mei, Stacy, and Charlie find a total of <lamar_found>5</lamar_found> + <mei_found>4</mei_found> + <stacy_found>10</stacy_found> + <charlie_found>8</charlie_found> = 27 eggs.

134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","Reformatted Question: Each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>. Each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>. Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>. He wants to separate them into groups of <fact4>8</fact4> and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>?

Answer: To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>, and each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>. Thus, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

Next, we determine the number of boxes required. Nik wants to separate <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> into groups of <fact4>8</fact4> crayons per box. Therefore, he needs 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes combined: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, to convert the total weight into pounds, we divide by the number of ounces per pound. Since each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."

- S (small) = <fact2>11</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 22 students
- M (medium) = <fact1>22</fact1> - 4 = 18 students
- L (large) = <fact3>18</fact3> / 2 = 9 students
- XL (extra-large) = <fact4>9</fact4> + 6 = 15 students

Now, add up all the shirts: 11 (XS) + 22 (S) + 18 (M) + 9 (L) + 15 (XL) = 75 shirts.

Answer:
Colby has already spent money on <movies_weekend>5 movies on Friday or Saturday</movies_weekend>, costing 5 * <ticket_price_weekend>$10</ticket_price_weekend> = $50. For the <movies_weekday>8 movies on other days</movies_weekday>, he spent 8 * <ticket_price_weekday>$7</ticket_price_weekday> = $56.

Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as <fact1>fragrance</fact1> and the same amount of <fact2>salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3> each time. She uses twice as much <fact4>oil as salt</fact4> and twice as much <fact5>salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer:  
Let the amount of citrus zest be \( x \) ounces. From <fact1>, the amount of fragrance is also \( x \) ounces. From <fact5>, the amount of salt is twice that of zest, so salt = \( 2x \) ounces. From <fact2>, the amount of sugar is also \( 2x \) ounces. The oil is twice the amount of salt, given in <fact4>, so oil = \( 4x \) ounces.

The total amount of all ingredients is given as <fact3>, 10 ounces:  
\[ x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10 \]  
\[ 10x = 10 \]  
\[ x = 1 \]

Each carnation needs <fact4>1.5 pounds</fact4>. If they plant <fact5>4 sunflowers</fact5> and <fact6>10 carnations</fact6>, how many roses can they plant?

Answer:
First, calculate the total weight of soil used by the sunflowers. They plant <fact5>4 sunflowers</fact5>, and each sunflower needs <fact3>3 pounds</fact3> of soil, so that’s 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers.

Next, calculate the total weight of soil used by the carnations. They plant <fact6>10 carnations</fact6>, and each carnation requires <fact4>1.5 pounds</fact4> of soil, so that’s 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil for the carnations.

Adding the soil used by sunflowers and carnations, we have 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil already used.

Subtract this from the total soil available: <fact1>30 pounds</fact1> - 27 pounds = 3 pounds of soil remaining for planting roses.

Since each rose needs <fact2>1 pound</fact2> of soil, they can plant 3/1 = 3 roses. Therefore, the answer is {3}."

Answer:
First, calculate the total number of invitees attending the party by adding all the invited guests and subtracting those who cannot attend: <fact1>25 classmates</fact1> + <fact2>7 dance classmates</fact2> + <fact3>13 family members</fact3> - <fact4>4 could not come</fact4> = 41 attendees.

The movie theater party set fee covers up to 20 people. Kayla's party exceeds this number by 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. For each additional guest, there is an additional cost of <fact6>$6</fact6>.

Thus, the additional cost for these extra guests is 21 * <fact6>$6</fact6> = $126.

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer: Sasha bought <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> at <fact3>$10 each</fact3>, totaling 10 * 10 = $100. She also bought <fact4>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> for <fact5>$16 each</fact5>, totaling 5 * 16 = $80. Therefore, her total cost was $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by <fact1>50%</fact1>, each 2 x 4 x 10 board can now be sold for 10 + (10 * 0.50) = $15, and each 4 x 4 x 10 board can be sold for 16 + (16 * 0.50) = $24.

Selling all the boards, the total revenue for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards would be 10 * $15 = $150, and for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, it would be 5 * $24 = $120. Hence, the total revenue from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost: $270 - $180 = $90.

How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"Reformatted Question: Crista's plants need to be watered every day. <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>. She has <fact2>20 plants</fact2>. <fact3>4 of her plants need half of a cup of water</fact3>. <fact4>The rest need a quarter of a cup of water</fact4>. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?

Answer: Crista has <fact2>20 plants</fact2> in total. <fact3>4 of her plants need half of a cup of water</fact3>, which totals to 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water. This means the remaining <fact2>20 - 4</fact2> = 16 plants need water. According to <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>, <fact4>the rest need a quarter of a cup of water</fact4>, so for these 16 plants, they require 16 * 0.25 = 4 cups of water. Thus, Crista needs a total of 2 + 4 = 6 cups of water every day for her plants. The answer is {6}."

And the <fourth_child_height_relation>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fourth_child_height_relation>. How tall is the fourth child, <measurement_unit>in inches</measurement_unit>?

Answer:
First, convert the <first_child_height>first child’s height</first_child_height> to inches: 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches. The <second_child_height_relation>second child is two inches taller than the first child</second_child_height_relation>, so the second child is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall. The <third_child_height_relation>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</third_child_height_relation>, so the third child is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall. The <fourth_child_height_relation>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fourth_child_height_relation>, so the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall. Therefore, the fourth child is <measurement_unit>72 inches</measurement_unit> tall."

Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>. He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>?

Answer: For a regular week, John has <fact1>6 periods</fact1> plus <fact5>2 extra classes</fact5> each day, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes a day. Each class lasts <fact2>40 minutes</fact2>, so each day he spends 8 x 40 = 320 minutes in classes. Since he goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, he spends 320 x <fact3>5 = 1600 minutes in class during the weekdays.

Additionally, he spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday. So, the weekly minutes are 1600, and 1/16 of 1600 is 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes on Saturday and the same on Sunday.

Therefore, his total learning minutes per week is 1600 + 100 (Saturday) + 100 (Sunday) = 1800 minutes. Converting minutes to hours, 1800 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning. The answer is {30}."

Answer: Brinley needs to get an average of <fact8>93</fact8> across <fact1>six tests</fact1>. Since Mr. Bert allows removing the <fact2>lowest score</fact2>, we will be calculating the average based on the best 5 tests out of 6. To have an average of 93, the total sum of the scores for the top 5 tests needs to be 93 * 5 = 465.

Brinley's current test scores are <fact3>89</fact3>, <fact4>71</fact4>, <fact5>92</fact5>, <fact6>100</fact6>, and <fact7>86</fact7>. The lowest score among these is <fact4>71</fact4>. Removing this, the sum of the scores becomes 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To meet the required total of 465 for the best 5 scores, she needs a sixth score that makes up the difference: 465 - 367 = 98.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test."

A nurses' station orders bandages in <order1>bulk packs of 50</order1>. On the <day3>third day</day3>, they ordered <order2>two bulk packs of bandages</order2> and only used <use3>half a pack</use3>. On the <day2>second day</day2>, they used <use2>ten fewer bandages</use2> compared to the <day1>first day</day1>. On the <day1>first day</day1>, the nurses used <use1>38 bandages</use1> and ordered <order3>one bulk pack of bandages</order3>. They had <end3>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</end3>. How many bandages did they start with on the <day1>first day</day1>?

Answer:
To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the <day1>first day</day1>, we need to consider the total number of bandages ordered and used over the three days. 

1. On the <day1>first day</day1>, they used <use1>38 bandages</use1> and ordered <order3>one bulk pack of bandages</order3>. Since each bulk pack contains <order1>50 bandages</order1>, this means they received 50 bandages.

2. On the <day2>second day</day2>, they used 10 fewer bandages than the <day1>first day</day1>, resulting in <use1>38</use1> - <use2>10</use2> = 28 bandages used.

3. On the <day3>third day</day3>, they ordered <order2>two bulk packs of bandages</order2>, which equals 2 * <order1>50</order1> = 100 bandages, and used <use3>half a pack</use3>, equating to 50/2 = 25 bandages.

4. The total number of bandages used over the three days is <use1>38</use1> + 28 + <use3>25</use3> = 91 bandages.

5. The total number of bandages purchased over the three days is <order3>50</order3> + <order2>100</order2> = 150 bandages.

6. They ended with <end3>78 bandages</end3> at the end of the <day3>third day</day3>.

Using the equation: Starting bandages + ordered bandages = bandages used + bandages remaining, we have:
Starting bandages + 150 = 91 + 78
Starting bandages + 150 = 169
Starting bandages = 169 - 150 = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the <day1>first day</day1>."

Answer:
- The base price of the truck is <fact1>$30,000</fact1>.
- The cost of the king cab upgrade is <fact8>$7,500</fact8>.
- The cost of the leather seats is <fact9>one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade</fact9>, so it's $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
- The cost of the running boards is <fact10>$500 less than the leather seats</fact10>, so it's $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
- The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is <fact11>$1,500</fact11>.

Thus, the total cost is:

<fact1>$30,000</fact1> (base price)

If <fact3>Tim</fact3> can ride his skateboard at <fact7>264 feet per minute</fact7>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer:
First, convert the distances from miles to feet. Tim lives <fact4>2 miles</fact4> from the school, which is 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet. Steve lives <fact5>3 miles</fact5> from the school, which is 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet. 

Next, calculate the travel time for each person. Tim rides at <fact7>264 feet per minute</fact7>, so his travel time is 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes. Steve rides his bike at <fact6>440 feet per minute</fact6>, so his travel time is 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Since Steve has the shorter travel time of 36 minutes, he wins the race. The difference in time is 40 (Tim's time) - 36 (Steve's time) = 4 minutes.

Therefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race. The answer is {4}."

After the second day, they had 10 (first day) + <fact3>13 (second day)</fact3> = 23 holes. After the third day, they had 23 + <fact4>8</fact4> - <fact5>2</fact5> = 29 holes. Therefore, on the fourth day, they dug 40 (total by the end of fourth day) - 29 (total before fourth day) = 11 holes. The answer is 11."

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Robles' first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>. Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2>, which is <fact3>enough to feed his three monkeys for a week</fact3>. The second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4> and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Answer: To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can use the given information. Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2> to feed three monkeys for <fact3>a week</fact3>, which is 7 days. First, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed per day: 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

The first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>. The second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4>, which would be 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. Together, the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

Since 45 bananas are consumed daily by all three monkeys, the third monkey eats the rest. Therefore, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day. The answer is the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."

Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has <fact1>54 lines</fact1> in the lyrics. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, and <fact3>four-fifths of them are his</fact3>. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, but only <fact5>a third of them are his lines</fact5>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Answer:  
The song has <fact1>54 lines</fact1>. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Of these, <fact3>four-fifths are Sean's</fact3>, so Sean has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines to memorize. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. Of these, <fact5>a third are Sean's lines</fact5>, so Sean has (1/3) * 108 = 36 lines to memorize. Therefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 54 (from the song) + 48 (from the second scene) + 36 (from the first scene) = 138 lines."
168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.

No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Reformatted Question:
Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1> that are kept alone and each hamster is given <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2>. The rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages</fact3> in equal groups and each rat is given <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>. There is also a pen of rabbits where <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5> are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6>160 pieces of straw</fact6> have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer:
First, calculate the total pieces of straw used by the hamsters. There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1>, and each hamster gets <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2>, so they use 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

Next, the rabbits use <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5>.

Therefore, the total straw used by both hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces.

The total straw distributed is <fact6>160 pieces of straw</fact6>, so the straw used by the rats is 160 - 70 = 90 pieces.

The rats are in <fact3>3 cages</fact3>, with each rat receiving <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>. If we let R represent the number of rats in each cage, the total straw used by the rats is 3 * R * 6 = 90.

Solve for R: 
3R * 6 = 90 
18R = 90 
R = 5

Thus, there are 5 rats in each cage."

If Lucy got <earnings on Monday>$56</earnings on Monday> from selling the apples picked on <day1>Monday</day1>, how many apples did she pick over the three days?

Answer: 
To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three-day period, we start with <day1>Monday</day1>. Lucy earned <earnings on Monday>$56</earnings on Monday> by selling all the apples at <price>$4 per piece</price>. Therefore, she sold <earnings on Monday>$56</earnings on Monday> / <price>$4</price> per apple = 14 apples on <day1>Monday</day1>.

On <day2>Tuesday</day2>, Lucy picked <apples on Tuesday>12 apples</apples on Tuesday>.

On <day3>Wednesday</day3>, she picked <multiplier>double</multiplier> the number of apples she did on <day2>Tuesday</day2>, which means she picked 2 * <apples on Tuesday>12 apples</apples on Tuesday> = 24 apples.

Finally, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples from each day: 14 apples on <day1>Monday</day1> + <apples on Tuesday>12 apples</apples on Tuesday> on <day2>Tuesday</day2> + 24 apples on <day3>Wednesday</day3> = 50 apples.

Tom has <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1> in his house. The living room is <fact2>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>. The rest of the house is <fact3>1000 square feet</fact3>. The bedrooms measure <fact4>20 by 12 feet</fact4> each. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?

Answer:
First, we calculate the total area of the bedrooms. Each bedroom has dimensions of <fact4>20 by 12 feet</fact4>, giving an area per bedroom of 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. With <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1>, the total area occupied by the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we determine the size of the living room. Since the living room is <fact2>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>, it will have an area of 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house has an area of <fact3>1000 square feet</fact3>.

Adding these areas together gives the total area of the house: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?,"Reformatted Question: Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July. He buys a package of fireworks worth <fact1>$400</fact1> and another pack worth <fact2>twice that much</fact2>. He gets a <fact3>20% discount</fact3> on them. He also buys a finale firework that costs <fact4>$150</fact4>. How much did he spend in total?

Answer: Tim bought two packages of fireworks and a finale firework. The first package costs <fact1>$400</fact1>. The second package costs twice the amount of the first one, which is 2 * <fact1>$400</fact1> = <fact2>$800</fact2>. Together, the two packages originally cost <fact1>$400</fact1> + <fact2>$800</fact2> = $1200. Tim receives a <fact3>20% discount</fact3> on these packages, which equals 0.20 * $1200 = $240. Therefore, after the discount, the cost for the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960. The cost of the finale firework is <fact4>$150</fact4>. Adding this to the discounted package total gives a total expenditure of $960 + <fact4>$150</fact4> = $1110. Tim spent a total of $1110."

John is a dean of a public school. John has <fact1>two classes</fact1> in his school. Each class has <fact2>1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact2>. Ali is a dean of a private school where <fact3>he teaches one class</fact3>. Ali's class has the capacity of <fact4>120 students</fact4>. What is the combined capacity of both schools?

Answer: John has two classes, and we know each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, so each of John's classes has a capacity of 120 * 1/8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is 15 * 2 = 30 students. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, so the total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students. The combined capacity of both schools is 30 (John's school) + 120 (Ali's school) = 150 students. The answer is {150}."

Answer:  
First, calculate the total worth of the cards. The <fact1>1 card is worth $4000</fact1>, and <fact2>another card is worth $1000</fact2>. Then, for the <fact3>30 more cards</fact3>, at <fact4>$50 each</fact4>, they are worth 30 * 50 = $1500. Therefore, the total worth of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

Next, calculate the total cost of purchasing the packs. Mark bought <fact5>3 packs for $1800 each</fact5>, so the total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total worth of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The answer is {1100}."
190,"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","Reformatted Question:
Elaine initially had <initial_cards>20 Pokemon cards</initial_cards>. After a month, she collected <three_times_first_month>three times that number</three_times_first_month>. In the third month, she collected <twice_combined_first_second>twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months</twice_combined_first_second>. In the second month, she collected <second_month_less_first>20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</second_month_less_first>. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?

Answer:
Let's use the key phrases to calculate the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now.

1. Initially, Elaine had <initial_cards>20 Pokemon cards</initial_cards>.

2. In the first month, Elaine collected <three_times_first_month>three times</three_times_first_month> the initial number, so she collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards.

3. In the second month, she collected <second_month_less_first>20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</second_month_less_first>. So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

4. In the third month, she collected <twice_combined_first_second>twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months</twice_combined_first_second>. The combined number from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Hence, in the third month, she collected 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards, sum the initial number, the first month, the second month, and the third month collections: 20 (initially) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Thus, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards. The answer is {320}."

Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the <fact1>fourth train</fact1> scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The <fact2>first train</fact2> is scheduled to arrive in <fact3>10 minutes</fact3>, and this train will stay in the station for <fact4>20 minutes</fact4>.

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Answer:
- The first train is scheduled to arrive in <fact3>10 minutes</fact3> and will stay in the station for <fact4>20 minutes</fact4>. Thus it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
- The second train arrives <fact6>half an hour after the first train leaves the station</fact6>, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. It stays for <fact7>a quarter of the time the first train stayed</fact7>, which is 20/4 = 5 minutes. Thus, it leaves at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
- The third train arrives <fact10>an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact10>, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes, and it leaves <fact11>immediately after it arrives</fact11>.
- The fourth train, which Paul will board, arrives <fact8>20 minutes after the third train leaves</fact8>, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul waits a total of 145 minutes for his train. The answer is {145}."
192,A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"Reformatted Question:
A bumper car rink has <fact1>12 red cars</fact1>. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have <fact2>3 times</fact2> the number of blue cars as they have green cars. If the rink has <fact3>75 cars in total</fact3>, how many yellow cars do they have?

Answer:
The rink has <fact1>12 red cars</fact1>. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10 cars. The number of yellow cars is <fact2>3 times</fact2> the number of blue cars, which means each blue car has 3 yellow cars. Let the number of blue cars be B. Then, the number of yellow cars is 3B.

According to the problem, the total number of cars is <fact3>75</fact3>. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of cars: red cars + green cars + blue cars + yellow cars = total cars.

Substitute the known values in the equation:

12 (red) + 10 (green) + B (blue) + 3B (yellow) = 75.

This simplifies to:

22 + 4B = 75.

Further simplification yields:

4B = 75 - 22 = 53.

Solving for B gives:

B = 53 / 4 = 13.25.

This value for B isn't valid since it needs to be a whole number. Thus, we must have made an error as each blue car has 3 times of it as yellow cars, let me try with using the correct interpretation of the total number of cars with proper integer solution.

Re-evaluation:
Let the number of yellow cars be Y,

Number of blue cars is B, so Y = 3B;

Now the equation is: 
12 (red) + 10 (green) + B (blue) + Y (yellow)= 75

Substituting Y as 3B,

22 + B + 3B = 75,
which gives,
22 + 4B = 75

4B = 53 (this contradiction instead evaluate back), total includes previous errors. Realize the misunderstanding into Any missing parts. Further re-check gives corrections, and given value of yellow cars correctly evaluated when could utilize real tangible value. 
In fairness, numerical verification relift:

B = number of blue cars
Y = 3B = yellow cars,

4B + 22 = 75, 
4B = 75 - 22
4B = 53

B = 13 when re-checking aligns, proper numeric conversion maintains, thus reflecting re-validation upon checking inconsistent equals was misunderstand.

Since there's clearly human element involvement understanding clear picture involves same operation. I apologize the initial errors utilizing critical  correctly, obtaining a logical standard adjustment.

What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?

Answer:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts. With the store's buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and gets 50% off the second T-shirt. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, so Jake pays $8 for the first T-shirt and $8 * 0.5 = $4 for the second T-shirt. Therefore, the total for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40, and a 40% discount means Jake pays 60% of the original price. Thus, Jake pays $40 * 0.6 = $24 for the shoes.

Adding the costs together, Jake spends $12 on T-shirts and $24 on shoes, for a total of $12 + $24 = $36.

What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?

Answer:
First, we calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Mr. Rogers bought it at <fact3>75% of its original price</fact3>, so he paid 0.75 * <fact2>$2000</fact2> = $1500.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","Reformatted Question:
James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>. He swims <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2>. He can swim at a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer:
James swims initially <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2> of the <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>, it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim this part. He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The remaining distance to swim is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. Since he swims the remaining distance at half the speed, that is 1 mile per hour (0.5 * 2). It takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining part. Therefore, the total time to cross the lake is 6 hours (first swimming part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (second swimming part) = 17 hours."

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Reformatted Question:
Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of <fact1>$200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5</fact3> for each person who attends. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer:
To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to establish an equation using the information given:

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food per person. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost}_1 = \text{Fact1} + (\text{Fact3} \times \text{Number of Guests}) = 200 + 5x. \]

For the second venue, the total cost is simply the cost per person, which is:
\[ \text{Cost}_2 = \text{Fact2} \times \text{Number of Guests} = 25x. \]

To find when these costs are equal, we set them equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x. \]

Solving for \( x \), we subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x. \]

Next, divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10. \]

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost. The answer is {10}."

207,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Reformatted Question: Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved <fact1>half as many balls</fact1> as in the second. He retrieved <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve <fact3>four more balls</fact3> than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?

Answer: Let the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set be \( x \). According to <fact1>, in the third set he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls. According to <fact3>, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls. The total number of balls he retrieved in all three sets is \( x + \frac{x}{2} + (x + 4) \), which according to <fact2> is 19. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + (x + 4) = 19 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Thus, in the second set, he retrieved 6 balls. According to <fact3>, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \) tennis balls. Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The answer is {10}."

Earlier, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with <fact4>1/2 a dozen brownies</fact4>. How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?

Answer: Greta made <fact1>one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies</fact1> for herself, which is 12 brownies (since a dozen is 12). Her friends contributed <fact2>4 dozen brownies</fact2>, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies. During her party, <fact3>1 1/2 dozen brownies</fact3> were eaten, which is 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies. She also received <fact4>1/2 a dozen brownies</fact4> from her office, which is 0.5 x 12 = 6 brownies. 

Adding these together gives her:
12 (from herself) + 48 (from friends) + 6 (from office) = 66 brownies in total at the beginning.

After the party, 18 brownies were eaten, so she had:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day. The answer is {48}."

After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  The movie took 5 weeks to finish.  How much did Jean pay?,"Reformatted Question:
Jeans makeup artist charges her <fact1>$250 an hour</fact1>. She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes <fact2>6 hours to do each day</fact2> and she needs it done <fact3>4 times a week</fact3>. After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a <fact4>10% discount</fact4> because of the amount of work done. The movie took <fact5>5 weeks to finish</fact5>. How much did Jean pay?

Answer:
First, we calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked. This is found by multiplying the number of hours per day (<fact2>6 hours</fact2>) by the number of days per week (<fact3>4 times a week</fact3>) and then by the number of weeks the movie took to finish (<fact5>5 weeks</fact5>). Thus, the total number of hours worked is 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount by multiplying the total number of hours (120 hours) by the hourly rate of the makeup artist (<fact1>$250</fact1>). Therefore, the cost before the discount is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Finally, we apply the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>. The discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000. Hence, the total amount paid by Jean after the discount is applied is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Therefore, Jean paid a total of $27,000."

By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?

Answer:
To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to sum the crates of bread he sold over the week and compare it to his target. According to the reformatted question, Sam's target was to sell <fact1>120 crates in a week</fact1>. He was closed on <fact2>Monday and Friday</fact2> and sold:

- <fact3>15 crates on Tuesday</fact3>
- <fact4>12 crates on Wednesday</fact4>
- <fact5>18 crates on Thursday</fact5>
- <fact6>20 crates over the weekend</fact6>

The total number of crates sold by Sam during that week is: 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Comparing this to his target of <fact1>120 crates</fact1>, we calculate how many crates short he was: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."

Answer:
At the start, Maria had <fact2>1 balloon</fact2>, and each of her <fact1>4 friends</fact1> did not initially have any balloons. When Maria's mom gave <fact3>each person 3 more balloons</fact3>, all 5 people (Maria plus her 4 friends) received 3 balloons each, totaling 5 * 3 = 15 balloons.

Then, Maria gave <fact4>each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons</fact4>, totaling 4 * 2 = 8 balloons given away. After giving away 8 balloons, Maria had 4 - 8 = -4 + 8 = 0 balloons left (since you can't have negative balloons, she simply redistributed all her balloons). 

So, calculating the final balloon count: Maria has 0, and each of her 4 friends has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls have in the end is 4 friends * 5 balloons each = 20 balloons. The answer is {20}."

The tree will cost <fact4>$90 to plant</fact4>. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

Answer:  
To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money, we first calculate how much he earns from the lemons each year. Each lemon sells for <fact2>$1.5</fact2>, and the tree produces <fact1>7 lemons</fact1> a year, so he earns 7 * 1.5 = $10.5 annually. However, it costs him <fact3>$3 a year</fact3> to water and feed the tree, so his net earnings each year are $10.5 - $3 = $7.5. The initial cost to plant the tree is <fact4>$90</fact4>. To cover this cost, we divide the cost by the annual net earnings: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years. Therefore, it will take 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. The answer is {12}."

The soup costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the bagel. So, the soup costs $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5. Now we add up the prices: $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) + $5 (soup) = $11. Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."

A large t-shirt is <fact1>6 square feet of fabric</fact1>. A small t-shirt is <fact2>3 square feet of fabric</fact2>. Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A medium t-shirt is <fact3>4 square feet of fabric</fact3>. If she uses <fact4>11 small shirts</fact4>, <fact5>8 medium</fact5>, and <fact6>6 large shirts</fact6>, how many square feet is the quilt?

Answer:
For the quilt, Octavia uses:
- <fact4>11 small shirts</fact4>, contributing <fact2>3 square feet per small shirt</fact2> for a total of 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.
- <fact5>8 medium shirts</fact5>, contributing <fact3>4 square feet per medium shirt</fact3> for a total of 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.
- <fact6>6 large shirts</fact6>, contributing <fact1>6 square feet per large shirt</fact1> for a total of 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Adding them together, the quilt will be 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet in total. The answer is {101}."

Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A <fact1>2 x 4 costs $4</fact1>. A <fact2>2 x 8 costs $6</fact2>. He can get <fact3>200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood</fact3> and <fact4>400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood</fact4>. He has <fact5>$24 to buy wood</fact5> for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer:
To determine how many sticks Frederick can make with <fact5>$24</fact5> by purchasing the cheapest wood, we start by identifying the cheapest option: the <fact1>2 x 4 costs $4</fact1>. We calculate how many 2 x 4s Frederick can purchase: <fact5>$24</fact5> ÷ <fact1>$4 per 2 x 4</fact1> = 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood. Using <fact3>a 2 x 4 piece of wood, which yields 200 sticks</fact3>, Frederick can make 6 x <fact3>200 sticks</fact3> = 1200 sticks by purchasing all 2 x 4s. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make with the cheapest lumber is 1200."

Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a <fact1>case of 12 sodas</fact1> and shook <fact2>3 of them up</fact2>. Ellen's brother stopped by and took <fact3>1 of the shaken sodas</fact3> and <fact4>2 of the unshaken sodas</fact4>, then Ellen's friend came along. By this point, Ellen had taken <fact5>1 unshaken soda for herself</fact5> and left. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Answer:

Initially, there are <fact1>12 sodas</fact1>, and <fact2>3 are shaken</fact2>. Ellen's brother takes <fact3>1 shaken</fact3> and <fact4>2 unshaken</fact4>. So, there are <fact2>3 - 1 = 2 shaken</fact2> sodas left and <fact1>12 - 3 - 1 - 2 = 6 unshaken</fact1> sodas left because Ellen takes <fact5>1 unshaken</fact5> soda. Therefore, the total number of sodas left is 2 shaken and 6 unshaken, making a total of 8 sodas. The likelihood that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/8. Expressed as a percentage, this is (2/8) * 100 = 25%. The answer is {25}."

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Reformatted Question:
Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>. Over the third year it depreciated <fact4>20%</fact4>. Over the first year it depreciated <fact2>30%</fact2>. The second year it depreciated another <fact3>30%</fact3>. How much is the boat worth after the three years?

Answer:
To determine the boat's worth after three years, we need to apply the sequential depreciations described in the question. Initially, the boat costs <fact1>$9000</fact1>. 

1. First Year Depreciation: The boat depreciates by <fact2>30%</fact2>. Thus, it loses 9000 * 0.30 = $2700. After this depreciation, the boat's value is 9000 - 2700 = $6300.

2. Second Year Depreciation: The boat depreciates another <fact3>30%</fact3>. Now, it loses 6300 * 0.30 = $1890. After this depreciation, the boat's value is 6300 - 1890 = $4410.

3. Third Year Depreciation: The boat further depreciates by <fact4>20%</fact4>. Thus, it loses 4410 * 0.20 = $882. After this depreciation, the boat's value is 4410 - 882 = $3528.

Therefore, after three years, the boat is worth $3528."

Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she <fact1>woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am</fact1>. Also, that day she <fact2>woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom</fact2>. She <fact3>usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m.</fact3> and <fact4>wakes up at 6 a.m.</fact4>. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?

Answer:
First, calculate the total amount of sleep Kim usually gets by noting that she <fact3>goes to sleep at 10 p.m.</fact3> and <fact4>wakes up at 6 a.m.</fact4>. This is a period of 8 hours, or 480 minutes.

On the day in question, Kim <fact1>awoke to sleepwalk from 2:15 to 2:38 am</fact1>, which is a total of 23 minutes awake. Additionally, she <fact2>woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual</fact2> to go to the bathroom.

Subtract the sleepwalking period and the early wake-up time from her usual 480 minutes of sleep: 480 minutes - 23 minutes - 5 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept for 452 minutes on her bed that day."
