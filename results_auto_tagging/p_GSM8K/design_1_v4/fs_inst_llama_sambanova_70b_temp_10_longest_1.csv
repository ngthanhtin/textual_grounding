Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with <fact1>5 games</fact1> for his birthday.  For the <fact2>third year</fact2> he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>.  He saves up enough money to buy <fact5>1 game per month for a year</fact5>, and then the <fact6>second year</fact6> he starts buying <fact7>2 games a month</fact7>.  How many games does Steve have after <fact8>3 years</fact8>?

Answer: Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1>. He gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>, so over <fact8>3 years</fact8>, he gets 5 * 3 = 15 games. For <fact5>1 year</fact5>, he buys <fact5>1 game per month</fact5>, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games. For the <fact6>second year</fact6>, he buys <fact7>2 games a month</fact7>, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games. For the <fact2>third year</fact2>, he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3>, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games. So, Steve has 5 + 15 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 104 games. The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue.

The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer: To peel a potato, it takes <fact2>a minute and a half</fact2> or 90 seconds. To cut a potato, it takes <fact3>5 seconds</fact3>. So, to peel and cut one potato, it takes 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. To peel and cut <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1>, it will take 60 x 95 = 5700 seconds. The answer is {5700}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>.  He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>.  Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>.  He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>.  How much money was he out?

Answer: James bought <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> at <fact4>$15</fact4> each. But he got them at <fact5>40% off</fact5>, so he paid <fact4>$15</fact4> * (1 - <fact5>40%</fact5>) = <fact4>$15</fact4> * 0.6 = $9 per CD. So he paid a total of <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> * $9 per CD = $90 for all the CDs. He sold <fact2>5 of them</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>, so he was out $90 - $40 = $50. The answer is {50}."
5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Reformatted Question: A bag of glass chips holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>. It takes <fact3>twelve glass chips</fact3> to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has, which is <fact1>72 chips</fact1> * <fact4>2 bags</fact4> = 144 chips. Since the mosaic is <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>, the area of the mosaic is the length times the height, so it is 3L square inches. It takes <fact3>twelve glass chips</fact3> to make every square inch of the mosaic, so it takes 12 * 3L = 36L glass chips to make the mosaic. Since Milo has 144 glass chips, we have 36L = 144, so L = 144/36 = 4 inches. The answer is {4}."
6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Reformatted Question: Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The first needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>. On average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>. The third needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. How many miles does the last dog need?

Answer: The average miles per day for the dogs is <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>, and there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>, so the total miles per day is <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3> * <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> = 12 miles. The first dog needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second dog needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>, and the third dog needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is <fact2>1 mile</fact2> + <fact4>4 miles</fact4> + <fact5>3 miles</fact5> = 8 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?

Answer: To determine the difference in sales between vanilla scents and fruity scents, we need to first calculate the total number of each scent sold. Since they sell <fact1>5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> and they have <fact3>4 vanilla scents</fact3>, they sold a total of <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 20 vanilla scents. Similarly, they sell <fact2>2 of each of the fruity scents</fact2> and they have <fact4>8 fruity scents</fact4>, they sold a total of <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 16 fruity scents. Therefore, the difference in sales between vanilla scents and fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4. The answer is {4}."
8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","Reformatted Question: Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do <fact1>$450 worth of damage</fact1> to his car.

Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron <fact4>$120</fact4> for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Answer: If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will have to pay <fact1>$450</fact1> in damages. If he fixes the pothole, he will have to pay <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact3>$25</fact3> = $75 for the asphalt and <fact4>$120</fact4> for the fine. This makes a total of $75 + $120 = $195. Thus, Ron saves <fact1>$450</fact1> - $195 = $255 by fixing the pothole. The answer is {255}."
9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","Reformatted Question: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>.  His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot to remove the old carpet</fact2>, and <fact3>$34 per square foot to install the new carpet</fact3>.  The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer: First, we need to find the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is <fact1>18 feet</fact1> * <fact1>12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet. It will cost <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> * 216 square feet = $864 to remove the old carpet. It will cost <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> * 216 square feet = $7344 to install the new carpet. The new carpet will cost <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> * 216 square feet = $2592. The padding underneath will cost <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5> * 216 square feet = $432. Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet will be $864 + $7344 + $2592 + $432 = $11232. The answer is {11232}."
10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted Question: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and more apples from the <fact3>average trees</fact3>. Her sister gathers <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4> and <fact5>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5>. She doesn't take any from the <fact3>average trees</fact3>. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a <fact6>combined total of 500 apples</fact6>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the <fact3>average trees</fact3>?

Answer: Joanne gathered <fact1>30 apples</fact1> from the tallest trees and <fact2>half this amount</fact2> = <fact1>30</fact1>/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Joanne's sister gathered <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4> = 2 * <fact1>30</fact1> = 60 apples and <fact5>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5> = 3 * 15 = 45 apples. So Joanne's sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples. This means that Joanne gathered <fact6>500 apples</fact6> - 105 apples = 395 apples. Since Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she must have gathered 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is {350}."
11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Reformatted Question: Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>.  Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet</fact4> between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6</fact5> at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. To do this, we need to calculate the total space required for each flower, which includes the space taken up by the flower and the space between each flower. Since Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3>, we need to convert this to feet, which is <fact3>12</fact3>/12 = 1 foot. So, the total space required for each flower is <fact3>1 foot</fact3> (for the flower) + <fact4>1.5 feet</fact4> (for the space between flowers) = 2.5 feet. Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed by dividing the length of the flower bed (<fact1>111 feet</fact1>) by the total space required for each flower (2.5 feet). This gives us <fact1>111</fact1>/2.5 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 44 flowers. Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 44 - <fact2>17</fact2> = 27 more flowers. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6</fact5> at the store, so Pat will spend <fact5>$6</fact5> * 27 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed. The answer is {162}."
12,John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"Reformatted Question: John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>. He spent <fact2>30% of the time</fact2> with the following events. He spends <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and half that time <fact4>swimming</fact4>.  He also watched <fact5>3 different shows</fact5> which were <fact6>2 hours each</fact6>.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find out how much time he spent on other activities. We know he spent <fact2>30% of the time</fact2> with the following events, which include boating, swimming, and watching shows. We know he spent <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and half that time <fact4>swimming</fact4>, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. He also watched <fact5>3 different shows</fact5> which were <fact6>2 hours each</fact6>, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows. In total, he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours on these activities. Since these activities took up <fact2>30% of the time</fact2>, we can set up the equation 0.30 * x = 15, where x is the total number of hours he spent on vacation. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.30 = 50. So he spent a total of 50 hours on vacation. Since he spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>, we can multiply 50 by 0.40 to get the number of hours he spent sightseeing. 50 * 0.40 = 20. The answer is {20}."

Answer: 
The teacher started with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1> and used <fact4>45%</fact4> of it on Monday. This means that he has <fact1>5</fact1> - (<fact1>5</fact1> * <fact4>0.45</fact4>) = <fact1>5</fact1> - <fact1>2.25</fact1> = <fact1>2.75</fact1> inches of chalk left. Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk that is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>, he will have to recycle the chalk when it is <fact1>2.75</fact1> - <fact2>2</fact2> = <fact1>0.75</fact1> inches smaller.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted Question: A gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1> and cost <fact2>$12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: The area of the north and south walls is <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3> = 80 square feet each. The area of the east and west walls is <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4> = 40 square feet each. Thus, the total area of the walls is 80*2 + 40*2 = 240 square feet. Since a gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1>, the total amount of paint needed is 240/<fact1>20</fact1> = 12 gallons. At <fact2>$12</fact2> per gallon, the total cost is 12 * <fact2>$12</fact2> = $144. The answer is {144}."

On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. <fact2>24 guests elected an early checkout</fact2> and <fact3>15 elected for a late checkout</fact3>. <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner was served</fact4>. In the afternoon <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>. How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?

Answer: The hotel initially had <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. After <fact2>24 guests elected an early checkout</fact2>, there were 100 - 24 = 76 guests left. Then, in the afternoon, <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>, which means that 2 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 30 people checked in. This makes the total number of guests 76 + 30 = 106. Then, <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner was served</fact4>, making the total number of guests 106 + 7 = 113. However, we still have to account for the <fact3>15 guests who opted for a late checkout</fact3>, which means they checked out after dinner. So, we subtract 15 from the total number of guests, which is 113 - 15 = 98. Therefore, the hotel has 98 guests after dinner."

If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Reformatted Question: 
Today is <fact1>December 31st</fact1>. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact2>30 lbs</fact2> by his birthday, which is <fact3>July 19th</fact3>. If Andy needs to burn <fact4>3500 calories</fact4> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

Answer: 
To find the calorie deficit needed per day, we first need to find the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. From <fact1>December 31st</fact1> to <fact3>July 19th</fact3>, there are 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 201 days. Andy wants to lose <fact2>30 lbs</fact2>, and since he needs to burn <fact4>3500 calories</fact4> to lose a pound, he needs a total calorie deficit of <fact2>30</fact2> * <fact4>3500</fact4> = 105000 calories. Thus, he needs a calorie deficit of 105000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories per day. The answer is {522}."

An orange costs <fact1>5 less than what a watermelon cost</fact1>. Dillon is sent to the store to buy <fact2>4 watermelons</fact2>, <fact3>20 peppers</fact3>, and <fact4>10 oranges</fact4>. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs <fact5>three times what each pepper costs</fact5>. What's the total amount of money he will spend if <fact6>each pepper costs 15$</fact6>?

Answer: 
To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up. Since a watermelon costs <fact5>three times what each pepper costs</fact5> and <fact6>each pepper costs 15$</fact6>, a watermelon costs 3 * 15$ = 45$. An orange costs <fact1>5 less than what a watermelon cost</fact1>, so an orange costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$. 
Dillon buys <fact2>4 watermelons</fact2>, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * 45$ = 180$. 
He buys <fact3>20 peppers</fact3>, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * 15$ = 300$. 
He also buys <fact4>10 oranges</fact4>, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * 40$ = 400$. 
Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$. The answer is {880}."

Answer: Jim starts with <fact1>20 pieces of gum</fact1>. He gives <fact2>half of the gum</fact2> to his sister. This means he gave away <fact1>20</fact1>/2 = 10 pieces of gum. So he now has <fact1>20</fact1> - 10 = 10 pieces of gum. He then chews <fact3>1 piece of gum for every 2 hours</fact3> at school. Since the school day is <fact4>8 hours</fact4>, he chews <fact4>8</fact4>/<fact3>2</fact3> = 4 pieces of gum at school. He also chews <fact5>1 piece of gum</fact5> on the way home and <fact6>1 piece of gum</fact6> after dinner. So he chews a total of 4 + <fact5>1</fact5> + <fact6>1</fact6> = 6 pieces of gum.

If his farm truck can carry <fact9>2250 pounds</fact9> at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: The farmer buys 2 * <fact5>1-pound boxes</fact5> of sugar cubes = 2 pounds of sugar cubes. He buys 20 * <fact6>65-pound sacks</fact6> of oats = 1300 pounds of oats. He buys 42 * <fact7>75-pound bales</fact7> of hay = 3150 pounds of hay. He buys 4 * <fact8>12-pound bags</fact8> of carrots = 48 pounds of carrots. The total weight of the feed is 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4500 pounds. If the farmer's truck can carry <fact9>2250 pounds</fact9> at a time, then the farmer will need 4500/<fact9>2250</fact9> = 2 trips.

They play for <fact5>4 hours</fact5>.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact6>1.5 times as long</fact6>.  How much money is used?

Answer: Jack can play a game with <fact2>1 quarter</fact2> for <fact3>20 minutes</fact3>. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play <fact4>half as long</fact4>, so they play for <fact3>20</fact3>/<fact4>2</fact4> = 10 minutes. One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact6>1.5 times as long</fact6>, so he plays for <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact6>1.5</fact6> = 30 minutes. They play for <fact5>4 hours</fact5>, so they play for <fact5>4</fact5> * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes.

A <fact4>third of the movies</fact4> are in various series and he knows he can get those for only <fact5>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact5> by just buying the series together. How much does replacing the movies cost if a <fact6>normal movie costs $10</fact6>?

Answer: A <fact4>third of the movies</fact4> are in series. So there are <fact1>600</fact1>/<fact4>3</fact4> = 200 movies in series. 200 * <fact5>6/10</fact5> * <fact6>$10</fact6> = $120 for the movies in series. The other <fact1>600</fact1> - 200 = 400 movies are not in series. Of those, <fact2>40%</fact2> are older movies. So there are <fact2>40%</fact2> * 400 = 160 older movies. 160 * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $800 for the older movies. The other 400 - 160 = 240 movies are not in series and not older. So 240 * <fact6>$10</fact6> = $2400 for the other movies. Therefore, the total cost of replacing the movies is $120 + $800 + $2400 = $3320. The answer is {3320}."

In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  How many students are leaving early?","Reformatted Question: 
Students who are football players, cheerleaders or part of band in Mr. Roper's class will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  In Mr. Roper's class of <fact1>30 students</fact1>, <fact2>20% of the class</fact2> are football players.  Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25% of the students</fact3> are cheerleaders or part of band.  How many students are leaving early?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since <fact2>20% of the class</fact2> are football players, and there are <fact1>30 students</fact1> in total, the number of football players is <fact2>20%</fact2> * <fact1>30</fact1> = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students. Now we know that there are 6 football players. Next, we need to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band. Since <fact3>25% of the students</fact3> are cheerleaders or part of band, out of the remaining class (excluding football players), we first need to find out how many students are left after excluding the football players. This will be <fact1>30 students</fact1> - 6 football players = 24 students. Now, we can find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band. This will be <fact3>25%</fact3> * 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students. So, there are 6 football players, and 6 students who are cheerleaders or part of band. In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early. The answer is {12}."

Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled <fact1>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact1> with water, and Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped</fact2> into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact3>, while Ms. B only pumped <fact4>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact4>. A tank has a <fact5>capacity of 18000 gallons</fact5>. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

Answer: 
To find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we first need to determine how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank in two days. On the first day, Wanda filled <fact1>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact1> with water, which is <fact1>1/4</fact1> * <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped</fact2>, which is <fact2>3/4</fact2> * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons. So, on the first day, Wanda and Ms. B pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact3>, which is <fact3>2/3</fact3> * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B only pumped <fact4>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact4>, which is <fact4>1/3</fact4> * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons. So, on the second day, Wanda and Ms. B pumped a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons. In two days, Wanda and Ms. B pumped a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the total gallons pumped from the tank's capacity: <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons. The answer is {6000}."

He's already put down a deposit of <fact4>$600</fact4>. He makes <fact5>$15 per hour</fact5> at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Answer: George needs <fact1>2 implants</fact1>, each with a base price of <fact2>$2000</fact2>, so the total cost of the implants is <fact1>2</fact1> * <fact2>$2000</fact2> = $4000. The crown costs an extra <fact3>$500</fact3> for each implant, so the total cost of the crowns is <fact1>2</fact1> * <fact3>$500</fact3> = $1000. The total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $1000 = $5000. George has already put down a deposit of <fact4>$600</fact4>, so he still needs to pay $5000 - <fact4>$600</fact4> = $4400. Since George makes <fact5>$15 per hour</fact5> at work, he needs to work $4400 / <fact5>$15 per hour</fact5> = 293.33 hours to pay for the dental work. The answer is {293.33}."

Boris produces <fact2>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact2>. How much does he produce the fourth week?

Answer: Boris produces <fact2>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact2>. The second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces <fact2>8,000</fact2>/2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate. The third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces <fact2>8,000</fact2> * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate. So, in the first three weeks, Boris produces <fact2>8,000</fact2> + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate. Since Boris produces <fact1>50,000 bars of chocolate each month</fact1>, Boris must produce <fact1>50,000</fact1> - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate the fourth week. The answer is {14,000}."

When she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact3>12 spoons</fact3>. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used <fact4>three of the spoons</fact4> to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x. When Julia went to set the table, she had a total of <fact3>12 spoons</fact3>, which is the sum of the spoons in the package she bought (x) and the spoons her husband bought (<fact2>5</fact2>). However, we must also consider that Julia used <fact4>three of the spoons</fact4> to sample her stew. So, the total number of spoons she had before using 3 spoons is x + <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact3>12</fact3> + <fact4>3</fact4>. Therefore, x + <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact3>12</fact3> + <fact4>3</fact4> = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 10. The answer is {10}."

When a UV light turned on, <fact3>6 jellyfish changed color</fact3>. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?

Answer: Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as N. We know that <fact1>a fifth of the jellyfish are large</fact1>, so the number of large jellyfish is N/5. We also know that <fact2>a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light</fact2>, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (N/5) * (1/3) = N/15. Since <fact3>6 jellyfish changed color</fact3>, we can set up the equation N/15 = 6. Solving for N, we get N = 6 * 15 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank."

Answer: 
Rose starts off by picking <fact1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</fact1>, which is 3 * 5 = 15 petals. She then picks <fact2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</fact2>, which is 4 * 6 = 24 petals. She then adds another <fact3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</fact3>, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals. She has 15 + 24 + 20 = 59 petals so far. As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops <fact4>1 of each</fact4> and the wind blows them away. This means she drops 1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 4 = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals.

Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>, which was <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>. Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>. How many did each person get?

Answer: 
We can start by finding out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1> and that was <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>, Carlos collected <fact1>27</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = 22 seashells. We also know that Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. In total, they collected <fact1>27</fact1> + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. Since they divided them equally between themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells. The answer is {20}."

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Answer: Since Chikote howls for <fact1>twice as long as Tobias</fact1>, and <fact3>Tobias's howls last 20 seconds</fact3>, Chikote's howls last 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Since <fact2>Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact2>, Igneous's howls last 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. Thus, the three wolves' howls last 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds combined.

Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: First, we calculate the total cost of the outfit before the discount. The shirt costs <fact2>$25</fact2> and the shorts cost <fact4>$35</fact4>, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60. However, there is a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3> on the shirt. The discount is <fact2>$25</fact2> * <fact3>30%</fact3> = $7.50. So the shirt will cost $25 - $7.50 = $17.50 after the discount. The total cost of the outfit after the discount is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50. Since Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1> to spend, he will not have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $52.50 - $50 = $2.50. The answer is {2.50}."

Answer: Clara's total cost for <fact2>20 pomegranates</fact2> at <fact3>$20 each</fact3> would be <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact3>$20</fact3> = $400. However, she got <fact1>$2 off at the till</fact1>, so she paid $400 - <fact1>$2</fact1> = $398. The next day, the price of pomegranates was <fact4>$30 per fruit</fact4>. The total cost of <fact2>20 pomegranates</fact2> would be <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact4>$30</fact4> = $600. But the store offered a <fact5>10% discount on the total cost</fact5>, so the discount would be <fact5>10%</fact5> * $600 = $60. Therefore, Sheila paid $600 - $60 = $540.

If they are there for <fact4>3 days</fact4> how much did the trip cost?

Answer: The hotel is <fact1>20% more expensive than normal</fact1> because it is a busy weekend. So the cost of the hotel per day is <fact2>$1500</fact2> + <fact2>$1500</fact2> * <fact1>20%</fact1> = $1500 + $300 = $1800.

He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Answer: Mark edits <fact1>1000 sentences</fact1> each week. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers. Therefore, he edits <fact1>1000</fact1>/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays him <fact2>5 cents per sentence</fact2>.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have <fact3>$5 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and get to ride the go-karts twice. The Go-karts cost <fact4>$10 a ride</fact4>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Let's denote the number of friends Morgan can invite as x. Each friend will play one round of mini-golf, which costs <fact2>$5</fact2>, have <fact3>$5 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and ride the go-karts twice, which costs 2 * <fact4>$10</fact4> = $20. So the total cost per friend is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. Since Morgan also needs to pay for herself, the total number of people is x + 1. The total cost is then (x + 1) * $30, which should be equal to or less than the budget of <fact1>$90</fact1>. We can set up the equation (x + 1) * $30 = $90. Solving for x, we get x + 1 = $90 / $30 = 3. Therefore, x = 3 - 1 = 2. The answer is {2}."

How many toys per hour does the <fact7>fifth worker</fact7> produce?

Answer: In <fact3>10 hours</fact3>, the first <fact5>2 workers</fact5> produce <fact5>6 toys per hour</fact5> * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> * <fact5>2 workers</fact5> = 120 toys. In <fact3>10 hours</fact3>, the next <fact6>2 workers</fact6> produce <fact6>4 toys per hour</fact6> * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> * <fact6>2 workers</fact6> = 80 toys. Thus, the first <fact5>2 workers</fact5> and the next <fact6>2 workers</fact6> produced 120 + 80 = 200 toys. The manufacturer needed <fact1>400 toys</fact1> and still needed <fact4>20 toys</fact4> after the <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, so they must have produced <fact1>400</fact1> - <fact4>20</fact4> = 380 toys in total. Therefore, the <fact7>fifth worker</fact7> must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys. The <fact7>fifth worker</fact7> worked for <fact3>10 hours</fact3>, so the <fact7>fifth worker</fact7> must produce 180 toys / <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 18 toys per hour. The answer is {18}."

Answer: 
To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and add them together. 

The distance to his friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5> plus the <fact2>10 miles</fact2> detour, for a total of 210 miles. Since he drives at a speed of <fact1>70 mph</fact1>, the time taken to get to his friend's house is 210/<fact1>70</fact1> = 3 hours.

The distance of the return trip is <fact3>240 miles</fact3> and he drives at a speed of <fact4>80 mph</fact4>, so the time taken for the return trip is <fact3>240</fact3>/<fact4>80</fact4> = 3 hours.

If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Answer: To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand. Millie makes <fact3>3 pitchers of lemonade</fact3> * <fact1>12 cups of lemonade per pitcher</fact1> = 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for <fact4>$1</fact4>, she makes a total of 36 * <fact4>$1</fact4> = $36. Her expenses are <fact2>$18</fact2>, so her total profit is $36 - <fact2>$18</fact2> = $18. Since Millie sells an average of <fact5>4 cups per hour</fact5>, she sells all 36 cups in 36 / <fact5>4</fact5> = 9 hours. Therefore, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Answer: To determine the number of skeins of wool needed, we must first calculate the amount needed for one grandchild. This amount is <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>4</fact3> + <fact4>12</fact4> + <fact5>1</fact5> + <fact6>2</fact6> = 21 skeins. Since Martha has <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1>, she will need 21 * 3 = 63 skeins of wool. The answer is {63}."
93,"Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students.

The charity raises a total of <fact1>$175,000</fact1>. <fact2>$50,000</fact2> comes from organizations and the rest from the students. Each student earns the same amount.  How much did each student raise?

Answer: The charity raises a total of <fact1>$175,000</fact1> and <fact2>$50,000</fact2> comes from organizations, so the amount raised by students is <fact1>$175,000</fact1> - <fact2>$50,000</fact2> = $125,000. Since there are 20 students working together and each student earns the same amount, the amount each student raised is $125,000 / 20 students = $6,250. The answer is {6,250}."

He then converts all his bills to <fact5>5 dollar bills</fact5>.  He lost <fact6>10 bills</fact6> while getting home.  How many <fact5>5 dollar bills</fact5> does he have?

Answer: First, Thomas withdraws <fact1>$1000</fact1> in <fact2>20 dollar bills</fact2>, which is <fact1>$1000</fact1>/<fact2>$20</fact2> = 50 bills. After losing <fact6>10 bills</fact6>, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left. Then he uses <fact3>half of the remaining bills</fact3>, which is 40/2 = 20 bills. So he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left. Since each bill is <fact2>$20</fact2>, he has 20 * <fact2>$20</fact2> = $400. After tripling his money, he has <fact4>3</fact4> * $400 = $1200. Finally, he converts all his bills to <fact5>5 dollar bills</fact5>, so he has $1200/<fact5>$5</fact5> = 240 bills. The answer is {240}."

Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.

Answer: On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak</fact4>, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. On the second day, he planted <fact1>10 more White Oak trees</fact1> than the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted <fact2>1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees</fact2> on the second day, so he planted 40 + 1/4 * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, Gunther added another <fact4>25 bananas</fact4> to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another <fact5>12 of the bananas</fact5>. How many bananas did Gunther count to be in the pile?

Answer: Arnold stole <fact2>half of the bananas</fact2> from the original pile of <fact1>48 bananas</fact1>, so he stole <fact1>48</fact1>/2 = 24 bananas. This left 48 - 24 = 24 bananas in the pile. Then, Gunther added <fact4>25 bananas</fact4> to the pile, bringing the total to 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold then stole <fact5>12 of the bananas</fact5>, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas in the pile.

He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4> and he also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer: To find the total miles driven, we multiply the <fact3>30 miles away</fact3> * 2 for the round trip = 60 miles per day. 60 miles per day * <fact1>5 days a week</fact1> = 300 miles per week. 300 miles per week * <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2> = 15,000 miles per year. He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4>, so he pays 15,000 * <fact4>$2</fact4> = $30,000 per year for driving. He also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>, so he pays 12 * <fact5>$150</fact5> = $1,800 per year in bonuses. Therefore, he pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 per year for driving.

This means that there is a 50% * (100% - <fact1>40%</fact1>) * (100% - <fact3>20%</fact3>) = 50% * 60% * 80% = 24% chance that the normal teacher will not give everyone an extension and Marcus will not get a personal extension. Adding this to the 50% chance that the substitute teacher will be in class, we get 50% + 24% = 74% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow. The answer is {74}."

She trades <fact6>50%</fact6> of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <fact7>90%</fact7> of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: Lorraine starts with <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact6>50%</fact6> of them for large buttons, which means she gets <fact5>40</fact5>*<fact6>50%</fact6>=20 large buttons from large stickers. The remaining <fact5>40</fact5>*<fact6>50%</fact6>=20 large stickers are traded for small buttons, and since each large sticker is worth <fact1>three small buttons</fact1>, she gets 20*3=60 small buttons from large stickers. She also trades <fact7>90%</fact7> of her <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> for large buttons. Since <fact7>90%</fact7> of <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> is <fact4>30</fact4>*<fact7>90%</fact7>=27, and each large button is worth <fact3>three small stickers</fact3>, she gets 27/<fact3>3</fact3>=9 large buttons from small stickers.

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"Reformatted Question: 
44 seniors need to receive awards.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are <fact1>$5</fact1>.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs <fact2>$20</fact2>.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact3>20%</fact3> cost per frame.  <fact4>1/4 of the seniors</fact4> are officers and they will need to receive cords that are <fact5>$12</fact5> each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer: 
The cost of the pins is <fact1>$5</fact1> x 2 = $10. The cost of the picture frames is <fact2>$20</fact2> x 44 = $880. The cost of etching the picture frames is <fact3>20%</fact3> x $880 = $176. The total number of officers is <fact4>1/4</fact4> x 44 = 11. The cost of the cords is <fact5>$12</fact5> x 11 = $132. Therefore, the total cost of the senior gifts is $10 + $880 + $176 + $132 = $1198. The answer is {1198}."

How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Answer: Mike is now penpals with <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact3>2</fact3> = 3 people. Each of them sends him <fact4>2 letters a week</fact4>, so he receives a total of <fact4>2</fact4> * 3 = 6 letters a week. He responds in kind, so he writes 6 letters a week as well. Each letter is <fact5>5 pages long</fact5>, so he writes a total of 6 * <fact5>5</fact5> = 30 pages a week. It takes him <fact1>6 minutes</fact1> to write a page, so he spends 30 * <fact1>6</fact1> = 180 minutes writing a week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 180/60 = 3 hours writing a week.

It also takes <fact7>2 pounds of special honey</fact7>. How much profit does he make selling <fact8>10 jars</fact8>?

Answer: To determine the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making 10 jars. The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is <fact5>2 pounds per jar</fact5> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact1>$6 per pound</fact1> = $120. The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is <fact6>1.5 pounds per jar</fact6> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact2>$8 per pound</fact2> = $120. The cost of honey for 10 jars is <fact7>2 pounds per jar</fact7> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact3>$10 per pound</fact3> = $200. So, the total cost of making 10 jars is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440. The total revenue from selling 10 jars is <fact4>$50 per jar</fact4> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> = $500. Therefore, the profit is $500 - $440 = $60. The answer is {60}."

During the <fact7>second week</fact7>, he made <fact8>300 kilometers every day</fact8>. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his <fact1>two-week-long</fact1> trip?

Answer: In the <fact3>first 4 days</fact3>, Tom traveled <fact4>200 kilometers every day</fact4>, so he traveled a total of <fact4>200</fact4> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 800 kilometers. Over the <fact5>next two days</fact5>, he traveled <fact6>30% of the distance traveled over the first four days</fact6>, which is <fact6>30%</fact6> * 800 = 240 kilometers. So in the first week, he traveled 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers. On the <fact2>seventh day</fact2>, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled on that day is 0 kilometers. During the <fact7>second week</fact7>, he made <fact8>300 kilometers every day</fact8>, so he traveled a total of <fact8>300</fact8> * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Answer: Tom starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2> and plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, so he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees. He also chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, after <fact3>10 years</fact3>, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact2>. He has <fact3>55 goats in Farm X</fact3> and <fact4>45 goats in Farm Y</fact4>. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?

Answer: 
To find the total number of goats left, we first need to determine how many goats were sold from each farm. Mr. Smith sold <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact2>, which means he sold 2 * <fact1>10</fact1> = 20 goats from Farm Y. We know that he has <fact3>55 goats in Farm X</fact3> and <fact4>45 goats in Farm Y</fact4>. After selling <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1>, he has <fact3>55</fact3> - <fact1>10</fact1> = 45 goats left in Farm X. After selling 20 goats from Farm Y, he has <fact4>45</fact4> - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y. Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 45 + 25 = 70. The answer is {70}."

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the total number of logs that John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of <fact4>80%</fact4> of the tree, we calculate the total length of the tree that can be used to make logs: <fact1>80 feet</fact1> * <fact4>0.8</fact4> = 64 feet. Then, we divide the total length of the tree that can be used to make logs by the length of each log: 64 feet / <fact2>4 feet per log</fact2> = 16 logs. Now, we calculate the total number of planks that John can make from the logs: 16 logs * <fact5>5 planks per log</fact5> = 80 planks. Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find out how much John makes: 80 planks * <fact3>$1.2 per plank</fact3> = $96. The answer is {96}."

Answer: Each muffaletta sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1> and would serve <fact2>4 people</fact2>. Since there would be <fact5>20 people</fact5> in total watching the game, Tyson needs to make <fact5>20</fact5>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 5 sandwiches. To make 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 * <fact1>1 pound of meat</fact1> = 5 pounds of meat and 5 * <fact1>1 pound of cheese</fact1> = 5 pounds of cheese. The <fact3>meat cost $7.00 per pound</fact3>, so he would spend <fact3>$7.00</fact3> * 5 pounds = $35 on meat. The <fact4>cheese cost $3.00 per pound</fact4>, so he would spend <fact4>$3.00</fact4> * 5 pounds = $15 on cheese.

Answer: There are <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs hidden in the yard originally. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <fact3>2 less than Stacy</fact3>, which is 10 - <fact3>2</fact3> = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is <fact3>8</fact3>/2 = 4 eggs. In total, they found <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> + 10 eggs + <fact3>8</fact3> eggs + 4 eggs = 27 eggs. Therefore, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden in the yard. The answer is {9}."

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Reformatted Question: Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of <fact1>citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and the same amount of <fact2>salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3> each time. She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact4>twice as much salt as zest</fact4>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance (<fact1>citrus zest as fragrance</fact1>), the amount of fragrance is also x. She uses twice as much salt as zest (<fact4>twice as much salt as zest</fact4>), so the amount of salt is 2x. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar (<fact2>salt as sugar</fact2>), the amount of sugar is also 2x. She uses twice as much oil as salt (<fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4>), so the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x. The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces (<fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3>), so we can set up the equation: x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. Combining like terms, we get 10x = 10. Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 1. Now we can find the amount of oil: 4x = 4 * 1 = 4. The answer is {4}."

If they plant <fact5>4 sunflowers</fact5> and <fact6>10 carnations</fact6>, how many roses can they plant?

Answer: To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to calculate how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations. They planted <fact5>4 sunflowers</fact5> that each need <fact3>3 pounds</fact3> of soil, so they used <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact5>4</fact5> = 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers. They also planted <fact6>10 carnations</fact6> that each need <fact4>1.5 pounds</fact4> of soil, so they used <fact4>1.5</fact4> * <fact6>10</fact6> = 15 pounds of soil for the carnations. In total, they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations. They started with a <fact1>30-pound bag of soil</fact1>, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.

Answer: 
At the <fact2>first stop</fact2>, <fact3>40 people entered the bus</fact3>, so the total number of people in the bus is <fact3>40</fact3> + <fact6>20</fact6> = 60 people.

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer: The cost price of ten <fact2>2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> is <fact3>$10 each</fact3> * 10 = $100. The cost price of five <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> is <fact5>$16 each</fact5> * 5 = $80.

Answer: Sally found <fact1>8 blue balloons</fact1> and added <fact2>75%</fact2> of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. This means she added <fact1>8</fact1>*<fact2>0.75</fact2> = 6 blue balloons to her clutch. Sally started with <fact3>25 red balloons</fact3>, but a gust of wind caused <fact6>40%</fact6> of them to burst. So, she lost <fact3>25</fact3>*<fact6>0.4</fact6> = 10 red balloons.

How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Answer: A normal student has <fact1>6 periods in the day</fact1>, but he has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes a day. Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours per week in class. He also spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. There are 7 days in a week, so he has 60 * 24 * 7 = 10080 minutes per week. He spends 1/16 * 10080 = 630 minutes per week on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, so he spends 630 / 60 = 10.5 hours per week on extra learning time.

159,"Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","Reformatted Question: Mr. Bert gives <fact1>six tests each semester</fact1>. Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the <fact2>lowest score from the average</fact2> each semester. If Brinley has scores of <fact3>89, 71, 92, 100 and 86</fact3> on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of <fact4>93</fact4>?

Answer: Mr. Bert gives <fact1>six tests each semester</fact1>, and Brinley has scores of <fact3>89, 71, 92, 100 and 86</fact3> on the first five tests. To calculate the average, we need to add the scores of all six tests and divide by <fact1>six</fact1>, but we can remove the <fact2>lowest score from the average</fact2>. Let's first arrange Brinley's scores in ascending order: 71, 86, 89, 92, 100. Since we can remove the <fact2>lowest score</fact2>, we can remove the score of 71. Now, we need to find the score on the sixth test such that the average of the remaining scores is <fact4>93</fact4>. Let's call the score on the sixth test x. The sum of the remaining scores is 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x. The average of these scores is (86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x)/5, and we want this average to be equal to <fact4>93</fact4>. So, we can set up the equation (86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x)/5 = 93. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x = 465. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get 367 + x = 465. Subtracting 367 from both sides, we get x = 98. Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to get an average of <fact4>93</fact4>. The answer is {98}."

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","Reformatted Question: A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of <fact1>50</fact1>. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. On the second day, they used <fact2>ten fewer bandages</fact2> compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used <fact3>38 bandages</fact3> and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had <fact4>78 bandages</fact4> left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?

Answer: On the first day, the nurses used <fact3>38 bandages</fact3> and ordered one bulk pack of <fact1>50</fact1> bandages. On the second day, they used <fact2>ten fewer bandages</fact2> compared to the first day, so they used <fact3>38</fact3> - <fact2>10</fact2> = 28 bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. Half a pack is <fact1>50</fact1>/2 = 25 bandages. So, the total number of bandages used over the three days is <fact3>38</fact3> + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages. They had <fact4>78</fact4> bandages left at the end of the third day. So, the total number of bandages they had over the three days is 91 + <fact4>78</fact4> = 169 bandages. They ordered one bulk pack of <fact1>50</fact1> bandages on the first day and two bulk packs of <fact1>50</fact1> bandages on the third day. So, they ordered <fact1>50</fact1> + <fact1>50</fact1> * 2 = 150 bandages. Therefore, they started with 169 - 150 = 19 bandages. The answer is {19}."

The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","Reformatted Question:

He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a <fact2>king cab upgrade</fact2>, a <fact3>towing package</fact3>, <fact4>leather seats</fact4>, <fact5>running boards</fact5>, and the <fact6>upgraded exterior light package</fact6>. The <fact7>king cab is an extra $7,500</fact7>, <fact8>leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade</fact8>, <fact9>running boards are $500 less than the leather seats</fact9>, and the <fact10>upgraded exterior light package is $1500</fact10>. What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?

Answer: The cost of the leather seats is <fact8>1/3</fact8> * <fact7>$7,500</fact7> = $2,500. The cost of the running boards is <fact9>$500 less than the leather seats</fact9>, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The cost of the king cab upgrade is <fact7>$7,500</fact7>. The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is <fact10>$1,500</fact10>. The towing package cost is not given, so we assume it is $0. The total cost of the upgrades is $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 + $0 = $13,500. The total cost of the truck is the cost of the upgrades plus the <fact1>base price of the truck</fact1>, which is $13,500 + $30,000 = $43,500. The answer is {43,500}."

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","Reformatted Question: 
Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives <fact1>2 miles away from the school</fact1>. Steve lives <fact2>3 miles from the school</fact2> and can bike at <fact3>440 feet per minute</fact3>. If Tim can ride his skateboard at <fact4>264 feet per minute</fact4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: 
To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we first need to find out who the winner is and how long it takes them to get home. To do this, we need to find out how long it takes Tim and Steve to get home. Tim lives <fact1>2 miles away from the school</fact1>, and there are 5280 feet in a mile, so Tim lives <fact1>2</fact1> * 5280 = 10560 feet away from the school. Tim can ride his skateboard at <fact4>264 feet per minute</fact4>, so it will take him 10560 / <fact4>264</fact4> = 40 minutes to get home. Steve lives <fact2>3 miles from the school</fact2>, and there are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve lives <fact2>3</fact2> * 5280 = 15840 feet away from the school. Steve can bike at <fact3>440 feet per minute</fact3>, so it will take him 15840 / <fact3>440</fact3> = 36 minutes to get home. Since 36 is less than 40, Steve will get home first and will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time it takes the winner to get home from the time it takes the loser to get home. So, the winner will be waiting 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race. The answer is {4}."

There is also a pen of rabbits where <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5> are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6>160 pieces of straw</fact6> have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer: First, we can calculate the total amount of straw used by the hamsters, which is <fact1>10 cages</fact1> * <fact2>5 pieces of straw per cage</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw. Next, we can calculate the amount of straw used by the rabbits, which is <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5>. Now, we can subtract the amount of straw used by the hamsters and the rabbits from the total amount of straw, which is <fact6>160 pieces of straw</fact6> - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw. This means that the rats used 90 pieces of straw. Since each rat is given <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>, we can divide the total amount of straw used by the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats, which is 90 / 6 = 15 rats. Finally, since the rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages</fact3> in equal groups, we can divide the total number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage, which is 15 / 3 = 5 rats. The answer is {5}."

Answer: To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we first need to find out how much money she has in total. The laptop originally costs <fact4>$600</fact4>, but Erika gets a discount of <fact2>$200</fact2> for trading in her old laptop. So the laptop now costs <fact4>$600</fact4> - <fact2>$200</fact2> = $400. Since Erika now only needs an extra <fact5>$50</fact5> to buy the laptop, she must already have $400 - <fact5>$50</fact5> = $350. We also know that Erika's mom gave her <fact1>$80</fact1>, and Erika earned <fact3>$150</fact3> from her part-time job.

Amalia, Megan, and Dior divided the home chores so that each person had something to do while the others were working. Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over <fact1>4 hours</fact1> longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Megan had to walk the dog and this took her <fact2>2 hours</fact2> longer than Amalia to complete her chore.  Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her <fact3>4 hours</fact3>. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.

Answer: 
Amalia took <fact3>4 hours</fact3> to mow the lawn. Megan took <fact2>2 hours</fact2> longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Megan took <fact3>4</fact3> + <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 hours. Dior took well over <fact1>4 hours</fact1> longer than Amalia, so Dior took <fact3>4</fact3> + <fact1>4</fact1> = 8 hours.

How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?","Reformatted Question: 
A shop sells school supplies. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy <fact1>five notebooks</fact1>, <fact2>two pens</fact2>, <fact3>one calculator</fact3>, and <fact4>one geometry set</fact4>. The shop gives a <fact5>10% discount</fact5> on all the purchased items. One notebook is sold at <fact6>$1.50 each</fact6>, a pen at <fact7>$0.25 each</fact7>, a calculator at <fact8>$12 each</fact8>, and a geometry set at <fact9>$10</fact9>.  How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?

Answer: 
To find out how much Daniel has to spend, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the discount. 
The cost of the notebooks is <fact1>five</fact1> * <fact6>$1.50</fact6> = $7.50. 
The cost of the pens is <fact2>two</fact2> * <fact7>$0.25</fact7> = $0.50. 
The cost of the calculator is <fact8>$12</fact8>. 
The cost of the geometry set is <fact9>$10</fact9>. 
The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30. 
The discount is <fact5>10%</fact5> of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3. 
So, the total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27. 
The answer is {27}."

She is also paid for <fact5>15 hours of work</fact5> at her second job, where she earns <fact6>$5 an hour</fact6>. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?

Answer: Annabelle earns <fact1>$10 per hour</fact1> * <fact2>20 hours</fact2> = $200 at her first job. She also earns <fact6>$5 per hour</fact6> * <fact5>15 hours</fact5> = $75 at her second job. This means she earns a total of $200 + $75 = $275. She already has <fact3>$80</fact3> in her savings. So, in total, she has $275 + $80 = $355. However, she needs <fact4>$400</fact4> to buy the phone.

Answer: Lucy got <fact3>$56 from selling the apples picked on Monday</fact3>, and she sells apples at <fact1>$4 per piece</fact1>, so she must have picked <fact3>$56</fact3>/<fact1>$4</fact1> = 14 apples on Monday. On Tuesday, she picked <fact2>12 apples</fact2>. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is <fact2>12</fact2> * 2 = 24 apples.

Answer: 
Carl's weight is <fact2>16 kg more than Martin's weight</fact2>, so Carl's weight is <fact4>55 kg</fact4> + <fact2>16 kg</fact2> = 71 kg. Christian's weight is <fact3>8 kg more than Carl's weight</fact3>, so Christian's weight is 71 kg + <fact3>8 kg</fact3> = 79 kg.

Answer: Mary has <fact1>18 new potted plants</fact1> and she already had <fact3>2 potted plants</fact3> * <fact4>40 window ledges</fact4> = 80 potted plants. So she had 18 + 80 = 98 potted plants.

Among those that are not indoor plants, <fact2>two-thirds of them are outdoor plants</fact2> while the rest are flowering plants. <fact3>One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</fact3>. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?

Answer: If <fact3>one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</fact3>, then 1/4 * <fact1>100 plants</fact1> = 25 plants are indoor plants. This means that the remaining 100 - 25 = 75 plants are not indoor plants. Among those that are not indoor plants, <fact2>two-thirds of them are outdoor plants</fact2>, which is 2/3 * 75 = 50 plants. The rest of the plants that are not indoor plants are flowering plants, so the number of flowering plants is 75 - 50 = 25. To find the percent of the plants that are flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

They will install additional items for an extra <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9>.   How much will this cost her?

Answer: Angela has <fact1>6 mirrors</fact1> and the interior design firm's offer only includes hanging <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>. Therefore, Angela will need to pay extra for <fact1>6</fact1> - <fact5>4</fact5> = 2 mirrors. Angela has <fact2>2 chandeliers</fact2> and the interior design firm's offer only includes hanging <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>. Therefore, Angela will need to pay extra for <fact2>2</fact2> - <fact7>1</fact7> = 1 chandelier. Angela has <fact3>20 pictures</fact3> and the interior design firm's offer only includes hanging <fact8>10 pictures</fact8>. Therefore, Angela will need to pay extra for <fact3>20</fact3> - <fact8>10</fact8> = 10 pictures. In total, Angela will need to pay extra for 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items.

She wanted to try something new, so she paid <fact5>half as much for a small pack of green apple gum</fact5> as she did for the pack of grape gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Answer: The total cost of the gum was <fact2>$7</fact2>. We know that she paid <fact4>$2</fact4> for a pack of grape gum and that she paid <fact5>half as much</fact5> for the pack of green apple gum, which is <fact4>$2</fact4>/2 = $1. So, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum was <fact4>$2</fact4> + $1 = $3. Since she bought <fact1>four packs of gum</fact1> and we know the cost of two of them, we can subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total cost to find the cost of the strawberry gum: <fact2>$7</fact2> - $3 = $4.

The <fact6>third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact6>, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Answer: 
The first train will stay in the station for <fact2>20 minutes</fact2> after it arrives in <fact1>10 minutes</fact1>, so it will leave the station in <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact2>20</fact2> = 30 minutes.

The second train will stay in the station for <fact4>a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station</fact4>, which is <fact2>20</fact2>/4 = 5 minutes. So the second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes. The third train will arrive <fact6>an hour</fact6> after the second train leaves the station, so it will arrive in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave the station in 125 minutes.

Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a <fact1>flat fee of $200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person who attends</fact2>.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5 for each person who attends</fact3>.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of guests as ""x"". The cost for the first venue will be <fact1>$200</fact1> + <fact3>$5</fact3> * x. The cost for the second venue will be <fact2>$25</fact2> * x. We want to find the value of x such that the two costs are equal, so we set up the equation: <fact1>$200</fact1> + <fact3>$5</fact3> * x = <fact2>$25</fact2> * x. We can solve for x by subtracting <fact3>$5</fact3> * x from both sides, which gives us <fact1>$200</fact1> = <fact2>$25</fact2> * x - <fact3>$5</fact3> * x = (<fact2>$25</fact2> - <fact3>$5</fact3>) * x = <fact2>$20</fact2> * x.

In the <fact1>third set</fact1>, he retrieved <fact2>half as many balls</fact2> as in the <fact3>second set</fact3>. He retrieved <fact4>19 tennis balls</fact4> in all. In the <fact5>first of three sets</fact5>, he had to retrieve <fact6>four more balls</fact6> than in the <fact3>second set</fact3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the <fact5>first set</fact5> of the match?

Answer: Let's assume that the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x. Then, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2 (since it's half as many balls as in the second set). The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + (x+4) = 19. We know that the first set has four more balls than the second set, so we add 4 to x. Solving the equation, we get 2x + x/2 + 4 = 19. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4x + x + 8 = 38. Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38. Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30. Divide by 5: x = 6. So the second set has 6 balls. Since the first set has four more balls than the second set, the first set has 6 + 4 = 10 balls. The answer is {10}."

Answer: 
Maria had <fact2>1 water balloon</fact2> for herself. Then her mom gave her <fact3>3 more balloons</fact3>, for a total of 1 + 3 = 4. Maria gave each of her <fact1>4 friends</fact1> <fact4>2 water balloons</fact4>, so she gave away 4 x 2 = 8 water balloons. This left Maria with 4 - 8 = -4 water balloons.

Each of Maria's friends had <fact3>3 water balloons</fact3> given to them by Maria's mom, and then they received <fact4>2 more water balloons</fact4> from Maria.

On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","Reformatted Question: When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of <fact1>$10 per hour</fact1>. Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is <fact2>$0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was</fact2>.  After <fact3>2 months</fact3>, Billy was given a raise of <fact4>$0.50 per hour</fact4>.  On his <fact5>first anniversary at work</fact5>, he was given a raise of <fact6>$1.00 per hour</fact6>. If both Billy and Sally work <fact7>20 hours</fact7>, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?

Answer: Sally's starting salary is <fact2>$0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was</fact2>, so Sally's starting salary is <fact1>$10</fact1> + <fact2>$0.50</fact2> = $10.50 per hour. After <fact3>2 months</fact3>, Billy was given a raise of <fact4>$0.50 per hour</fact4>, so Billy's salary increased to <fact1>$10</fact1> + <fact4>$0.50</fact4> = $10.50 per hour. On his <fact5>first anniversary at work</fact5>, he was given a raise of <fact6>$1.00 per hour</fact6>, so Billy's salary increased to $10.50 + <fact6>$1.00</fact6> = $11.50 per hour. Billy now earns $11.50 per hour and Sally earns $10.50 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work <fact7>20 hours</fact7>, then Billy will earn <fact7>20</fact7> * $11.50 = $230 and Sally will earn <fact7>20</fact7> * $10.50 = $210. The difference is $230 - $210 = $20. The answer is {20}."
215,"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","Reformatted Question: 
Carlos is planting a <fact1>lemon tree</fact1>. Each year it will grow <fact2>7 lemons</fact2>, which he can sell for <fact3>$1.5 each</fact3>. It costs <fact4>$3 a year</fact4> to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost <fact5>$90 to plant</fact5>. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

Answer: The profit made each year is the income from the lemons minus the cost of watering and feeding the tree. This is <fact2>7 lemons</fact2> * <fact3>$1.5 per lemon</fact3> - <fact4>$3 per year</fact4> = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year. However, the tree costs <fact5>$90 to plant</fact5>, so Carlos will need to make at least $90 in profit before he starts earning money. To find the number of years this will take, we divide the cost of the tree by the profit per year: <fact5>$90</fact5> / <fact6>$7.50 per year</fact6> = 12 years. The answer is {12}."

Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs <fact1>$11</fact1>. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for <fact2>$0.5 for 2 balloons</fact2>. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for <fact3>$7 each</fact3>. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Answer: 
To determine the amount of money each girl was given, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items they purchased and then subtract that amount from the total allowance they were given. They bought a cake for <fact1>$11</fact1>, and 1 dozen balloons for <fact2>$0.5 for 2 balloons</fact2>. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, they paid for 12/<fact2>2</fact2> = 6 sets of 2 balloons. This cost them <fact2>$0.5</fact2> * 6 = $3. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for <fact3>$7 each</fact3>, which cost them 2 * <fact3>$7</fact3> = $14. The total cost of these items is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. Since the two girls were given the same amount of allowance, they each received $28 / 2 = $14. The answer is {14}."

Sara babysits the neighbor's kids <fact4>4 times</fact4>, earning <fact5>$5</fact5> each time she babysits them. If Sara already had <fact6>$10</fact6> saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Answer: Sara wants to buy a jacket for <fact1>$30</fact1> and 2 pairs of shoes for <fact2>$20</fact2> * 2 = $40. In total, she needs $30 + $40 = $70. She already had <fact6>$10</fact6> saved before she started babysitting. She also earns <fact5>$5</fact5> * <fact4>4</fact4> = $20 from babysitting. So she still needs $70 - $10 - $20 = $40. She earns <fact3>$4</fact3> for each time she mows the lawn. So she needs to mow the lawn $40 / <fact3>$4</fact3> = 10 times. The answer is {10}."

In the <fact4>second year</fact4>, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the <fact1>first year</fact1>. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?

Answer: 
In the <fact1>first year</fact1>, the town will build <fact2>12 homes</fact2>. In the <fact4>second year</fact4>, the town will build three times as many homes as they built in the <fact1>first year</fact1>, so they will build <fact2>12</fact2> * 3 = 36 homes. In the <fact3>third year</fact3>, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. By the end of the <fact4>second year</fact4>, they will have built <fact2>12</fact2> + 36 = 48 homes. So in the <fact3>third year</fact3>, they will double that amount and build 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

219,"Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?","Reformatted Question: Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some <fact1>soup</fact1>, a <fact2>bagel</fact2>, and a <fact3>piece of cake</fact3>. The <fact3>cake</fact3> is only <fact4>half of the price of the bagel</fact4>. The <fact2>bagel</fact2> cost <fact5>$4</fact5>, and the <fact1>soup</fact1> <fact6>25% more</fact6>. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?

Answer: First, let's find the price of the <fact1>soup</fact1>. The <fact1>soup</fact1> costs <fact6>25% more</fact6> than the <fact2>bagel</fact2>, which costs <fact5>$4</fact5>. So the <fact1>soup</fact1> costs <fact5>$4</fact5> + <fact5>$4</fact5> * <fact6>25%</fact6> = <fact5>$4</fact5> + <fact5>$4</fact5> * 0.25 = <fact5>$4</fact5> + <fact5>$1</fact5> = <fact5>$5</fact5>. Next, let's find the price of the <fact3>cake</fact3>. The <fact3>cake</fact3> is only <fact4>half of the price of the bagel</fact4>, so the <fact3>cake</fact3> costs <fact5>$4</fact5> / 2 = <fact5>$2</fact5>.

Answer: To find the total area of the quilt, we need to calculate the total area of the small, medium, and large shirts. The area of the small shirts is <fact2>3 square feet per shirt</fact2> * <fact4>11 shirts</fact4> = 33 square feet. The area of the medium shirts is <fact3>4 square feet per shirt</fact3> * <fact5>8 shirts</fact5> = 32 square feet. The area of the large shirts is <fact1>6 square feet per shirt</fact1> * <fact6>6 shirts</fact6> = 36 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the quilt is 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet."

By this point, Ellen had taken <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5> for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Answer: There are <fact1>12 sodas</fact1> in total. Ellen shook <fact2>3 of them up</fact2>, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took <fact3>1 of the shaken sodas</fact3>, so there are 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas left. He also took <fact4>2 of the unshaken sodas</fact4>, so there are 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas left. Ellen took <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5>, so there are 7 - 1 = 6 unshaken sodas left. Therefore, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, for a total of 2 + 6 = 8 sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is therefore 2/8 = 0.25 = 25%. The answer is {25}."

Sydney's has <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> she spits each one <fact4>12 feet</fact4>. What is the average total distance spat?

Answer: To find the average total distance spat, we need to first find the total distance each person spat. Zoey spat <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 400 feet. Sydney spat <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> * <fact4>12 feet</fact4> = 420 feet. The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet. To find the average, we divide this total by 2, since there are 2 people. The average total distance spat is 820 / 2 = 410 feet. The answer is {410}."

Donny can only drink water if it's at least <fact4>40 degrees</fact4>.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Answer: Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x. When Donny pours <fact2>4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact2> and <fact3>one ounce from the other bottle</fact3> into his water bottle, the total amount of water in the bottle is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces. Since the temperature of the mixture is at least <fact4>40 degrees</fact4>, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation: (4 * <fact1>33</fact1> + 1 * x) / 5 >= <fact4>40</fact4>. Solving for x, we get: 132 + x >= 200, x >= 68. Therefore, the second bottle is at least 68 - <fact1>33</fact1> = 35 degrees warmer than the first bottle, but since the question asks for the temperature of the second bottle, we have to add the 33 degrees from the first bottle to get the answer. The answer is {68}."
