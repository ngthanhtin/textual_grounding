How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by <fact1>$50</fact1> each time and <fact2>3 other people</fact2> each bid once. She accepts the opening bid of <fact3>$200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer:
Since the opening bid is <fact3>$200</fact3> and <fact2>3 other people</fact2> bid before Carmen wins, the price goes up by <fact1>$50</fact1> four times (one for each of the other bidders and one for Carmen herself). The desk therefore costs <fact3>$200</fact3> + (4 * <fact1>$50</fact1>) = $400.  The answer is {400}.

* **Initial games:** Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1>.
* **Year 1:** He buys <fact5>1 game per month</fact5> for 12 months, totaling 1 * 12 = 12 games. He also receives <fact4>5 games</fact4> for Christmas.
* **Year 2:** He buys <fact8>2 games per month</fact8> for 12 months, totaling 2 * 12 = 24 games.  He also receives another <fact4>5 games</fact4> for Christmas.
* **Year 3:** He buys <fact3>4 games per month</fact3> for 12 months, totaling 4 * 12 = 48 games.  He gets another <fact4>5 games</fact4> for Christmas.

**Total:**

* **Year 1:** <fact1>5</fact1> (initial) + 12 + <fact4>5</fact4> = 22 games
* **Year 2:** 22 + 24 + <fact4>5</fact4> = 51 games
* **Year 3:** 51 + 48 + <fact4>5</fact4> = 104 games

Therefore, Steve has 104 games <fact9>after 3 years</fact9>. The answer is {104}.

                                                                        It takes Billy <fact2>1 minute and a half</fact2>, or 90 seconds, to peel each potato.  It takes him an additional <fact3>5 seconds</fact3> to cut each potato. So each potato takes 90 + 5 = 95 seconds to prep.  Since he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to prepare, it will take him 95 * <fact1>60</fact1> = 5700 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

Answer:
James bought <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> for <fact4>$15</fact4> each with a <fact5>40% discount</fact5>.  So, each CD cost him <fact4>$15</fact4> * (1 - <fact5>0.40</fact5>) = $9.  The total cost for all 10 CDs was 10 * $9 = $90.

He sold <fact2>5</fact2> of the CDs for <fact3>$40</fact3>.

So, he spent $90 and got back <fact3>$40</fact3>. He is out $90 - <fact3>$40</fact3> = $50. The answer is {50}.

The school auditorium has <fact6>4 rows</fact6> of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

**Answer:**

1. **Total seats:** The auditorium has <fact6>4 rows</fact6> * <fact1>18 seats/row</fact1> = 72 seats.

2. **Administrator seats:** Administrators occupied <fact2>1/4</fact2> * 72 seats = 18 seats.

3. **Remaining seats:** After the administrators, there were 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 <fact4>remaining seats</fact4>.

4. **Parent seats:** Parents occupied <fact3>1/3</fact3> * 54 <fact4>remaining seats</fact4> = 18 seats.

5. **Student seats:**  <fact5>The rest</fact5> of the seats were occupied by students. This means there were 54 <fact4>remaining seats</fact4> - 18 parent seats = 36 student seats.

A bag of glass chips holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>. It takes <fact3>twelve glass chips</fact3> to make every <fact4>square inch</fact4> of the mosaic. If he has <fact5>two bags</fact5> of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer:
Milo has <fact5>two bags</fact5> of chips, and each bag holds <fact1>72 chips</fact1>, so he has 2 * <fact1>72</fact1> = 144 chips.  Since it takes <fact3>12 chips</fact3> for every <fact4>square inch</fact4>, he has enough chips for 144 / <fact3>12</fact3> = 12 square inches.  He wants the mosaic to be <fact2>3 inches tall</fact2>, so to find the length, we divide the total area (12 square inches) by the height (<fact2>3 inches</fact2>): 12 / <fact2>3</fact2> = 4 inches.  Therefore, the mosaic can be 4 inches long.

The answer is {4}.

The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>.  His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> to remove the old carpet, and <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5> for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?


First, we calculate the area of the bedroom:  <fact1>18 feet</fact1> * <fact1>12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet.

The cost to remove the old carpet is: 216 square feet * <fact2>$4/square foot</fact2> = $864.

The cost of the new carpet is: 216 square feet * <fact4>$12/square foot</fact4> = $2592.

The cost of the padding is: 216 square feet * <fact5>$2/square foot</fact5> = $432.

The cost to install the new carpet is: 216 square feet * <fact3>$34/square foot</fact3> = $7344.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet is $864 + $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $11232.

Her sister gathers <fact7>twice as many apples</fact7> from the <fact2>tallest trees</fact2> and <fact8>3 times as many apples</fact8> from the <fact4>shortest trees</fact4>. She doesn't take any from the <fact6>average trees</fact6>. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of <fact9>500 apples</fact9>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the <fact6>average trees</fact6>?


**Answer:**

Joanne gathered <fact3>half</fact3> of <fact1>30 apples</fact1> from the <fact4>shortest trees</fact4>, meaning she gathered <fact1>30</fact1>/2 = 15 apples from the <fact4>shortest trees</fact4>.

Her sister gathered <fact7>twice as many</fact7> as Joanne from the <fact2>tallest trees</fact2>, meaning she gathered <fact1>30</fact1> * 2 = 60 apples from the <fact2>tallest trees</fact2>.  The sister also gathered <fact8>three times as many</fact8> as Joanne from the <fact4>shortest trees</fact4>, meaning she gathered 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the <fact4>shortest trees</fact4>.

In total, Joanne gathered <fact1>30</fact1> + 15 + <fact5>x</fact5> apples, where x represents the number of apples she gathered from the <fact6>average trees</fact6>. Her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Together they gathered <fact9>500 apples</fact9>.  Therefore, (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = <fact9>500</fact9>.  Simplifying this equation, we get 45 + x + 105 = 500, which further simplifies to 150 + x = 500.

Solving for x, we find x = 500 - 150 = 350.  Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the <fact6>average trees</fact6>.

Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet</fact1> long. Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>. Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches</fact3> (<fact4>1 foot</fact4>) wide, so she needs to leave <fact5>1.5 feet</fact5> between every plant. Each flowering plant costs <fact6>$6</fact6> at the store. How much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the total space each plant will occupy, including the spacing.  Since each plant is <fact4>1 foot</fact4> wide and requires <fact5>1.5 feet</fact5> of spacing, each plant will take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet of the flower bed.

Next, we determine how many plants can fit in the <fact1>111-foot</fact1> flower bed. This is 111 / 2.5 = 44.4 plants. Since we can't have parts of plants, Pat can fit a maximum of 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already has <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Finally, since each plant costs <fact6>$6</fact6>, Pat will spend 27 * $6 = $162 at the store.

The answer is {162}.

John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>. He spent <fact2>30% of the time</fact2> with the following events. He spends <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and <fact4>half that time swimming</fact4>.  He also <fact5>watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact5>.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?

**Answer:**

First, calculate the time spent swimming: <fact4>Half</fact4> of the <fact3>6 hours</fact3> spent boating is <fact3>6</fact3> / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, calculate the time spent watching shows: <fact5>3 shows * 2 hours/show</fact5> = 6 hours.

Now, find the total time spent on the activities besides sightseeing: <fact3>6 hours (boating)</fact3> + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours.

These activities (boating, swimming, and shows) represent <fact2>30% of his total vacation time</fact2>.  Therefore, 15 hours is equal to 30% of the total time. To find 100% of the time (the total vacation time), set up a proportion:

15 hours / 30% = x hours / 100%

Solving for x: x = (15 hours * 100%) / 30% = 50 hours

Finally, calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is <fact1>40% of the total vacation time</fact1>: 50 hours * <fact1>40%</fact1> = 20 hours.

The answer is {20}.

There are <fact1>52 members</fact1> in the choir, and <fact3>50% are girls</fact3>. So there are 52 * 0.50 = 26 girls.

The choir decides to perform with only the <fact4>female members</fact4>, so there would have been 26 girls performing.

However, <fact6>half of the girls couldn't make it</fact6> due to a broken-down bus. This means 26 / 2 = 13 girls were able to perform.

A teacher uses a <fact1>5-inch</fact1> piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use <fact3>20%</fact3> of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk.

If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20%</fact3> of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?


**Answer:**

The teacher starts with a <fact1>5-inch</fact1> piece of chalk.  He used <fact4>45%</fact4> on Monday, leaving 100% - <fact4>45%</fact4> = 55% of the chalk remaining. This translates to 0.55 * <fact1>5 inches</fact1> = 2.75 inches.

He recycles the chalk when it's smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>. He uses <fact3>20%</fact3> of the *remaining* chalk each day.

* **Day 1:** He uses 0.20 * 2.75 inches = 0.55 inches.  Remaining chalk: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches.
* **Day 2:** He uses 0.20 * 2.2 inches = 0.44 inches. Remaining chalk: 2.2 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches.

Since 1.76 inches is less than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>, he has to recycle the chalk after Day 2.  Therefore, he has 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

**Answer:**

The volume of the pool is calculated by multiplying the width, length, and depth. Using the provided measurements (<fact1>14 feet</fact1>, <fact2>25 feet</fact2>, and <fact3>4 feet</fact3>), the volume is 14 * 25 * 4 = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume to gallons using the provided conversion factor (<fact4>multiply by 5.9</fact4>). So, the pool holds 1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon (<fact5>$0.10</fact5>). The total cost will be 8260 * 0.10 = $826.

The answer is {826}.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in <fact1>15 minutes</fact1>. They decide to do it on a football field that is <fact2>100 yards</fact2> long. Kelly runs back and forth <fact3>once</fact3>, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the <fact4>40-yard line</fact4> and back. She does this <fact5>34 times</fact5>. Blake runs back and forth <fact6>15 times</fact6>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

                    Answer:

Kelly runs the length of the field and back <fact3>once</fact3>, so she runs <fact2>100 yards</fact2> * 2 = 200 yards.  Then, she runs to the <fact4>40-yard line</fact4> and back <fact5>34 times</fact5>. Each of these runs is <fact4>40 yards</fact4> * 2 = 80 yards.  So, for these runs, she travels 80 yards * <fact5>34</fact5> = 2720 yards. In total, Kelly runs 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

Blake runs back and forth <fact6>15 times</fact6>.  Each back and forth is <fact2>100 yards</fact2> * 2 = 200 yards. So, he runs a total of 200 yards * <fact6>15</fact6> = 3000 yards.

Blake runs farther than Kelly. The difference is 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards. The answer is {80}.

How much will it cost to paint the room?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

A gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1> and cost <fact2>$12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

The north and south walls have an area of <fact3>10ft x 8ft</fact3> = 80 sq ft each.  Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 80 sq ft * 2 = 160 sq ft.

The east and west walls have an area of <fact4>5ft x 8ft</fact4> = 40 sq ft each. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 40 sq ft * 2 = 80 sq ft.

The total area of all four walls is 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft.

Since a gallon of paint covers <fact1>20 square feet</fact1>, Tony will need 240 sq ft / <fact1>20 sq ft/gallon</fact1> = 12 gallons of paint.

Given that each gallon costs <fact2>$12</fact2>, the total cost to paint the room will be 12 gallons * <fact2>$12/gallon</fact2> = $144.


The answer is {144}.

If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","**Reformatted Question:** Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact1>30 lbs.</fact1> by his birthday, which is <fact2>July 19th</fact2>. If Andy needs to burn <fact3>3500 calories</fact3> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.  There are 31 days in January, 28 in February (since it's not a leap year), 31 in March, 30 in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, and 19 in July.  So, the total number of days is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Andy wants to lose <fact1>30 lbs</fact1>, and it takes a <fact3>3500 calorie</fact3> deficit to lose one pound. Therefore, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of <fact1>30</fact1> * <fact3>3500</fact3> = 105,000 calories.

Since he has 200 days (<fact2>until July 19th</fact2>) to achieve this, his daily calorie deficit should be 105,000 / 200 = 525 calories per day.

The answer is {525}.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags.

A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>two 1-pound boxes</fact1> of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys <fact2>twenty 65-pound sacks</fact2>. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys <fact3>forty-two 75-pound bales</fact3>. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact4>four 12-pound bags</fact4>. If his <fact5>farm truck can carry 2250 pounds</fact5> at a time, <fact6>how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed</fact6>?

**Answer:**

First, we calculate the total weight of the sugar cubes: <fact1>2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds</fact1>.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the oats: <fact2>20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds</fact2>.

Then, we calculate the total weight of the hay: <fact3>42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds</fact3>.

And the total weight of the carrots: <fact4>4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds</fact4>.

Adding all the weights together, the total weight of the feed is 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4500 pounds.

Since the <fact5>truck can only carry 2250 pounds</fact5> at a time, the farmer will need to make 4500 pounds / <fact5>2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips</fact5> to transport all the feed.  Therefore, given the question to determine <fact6>how many trips are required</fact6>, the answer is {2}.

Carl's favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used <fact1>2 slices of cheese</fact1> on each sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used <fact2>8 slices of cheese</fact2> in it. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast <fact3>3 days</fact3> in the week using <fact4>one more slice per omelet</fact4> than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?


**Answer:**

Carl used <fact1>2 slices of cheese per sandwich</fact1> and ate a sandwich every day for 7 days (a week).  So, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

He used <fact2>8 slices of cheese</fact2> for macaroni and cheese.

He ate omelets for <fact3>3 days</fact3> and used <fact4>one more slice than on his sandwiches</fact4>, meaning he used <fact1>2</fact1> + <fact4>1</fact4> = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. This totals 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

In total, Carl used 14 + 8 + 9 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is {31}.

How much does replacing the movies cost if <fact6>a normal movie costs $10</fact6>?


A third (<fact4>1/3</fact4>) of the movies are series movies: <fact1>600</fact1> * (1/3) = 200 series movies.
The remaining movies are non-series movies: <fact1>600</fact1> - 200 = 400 non-series movies.

<fact2>40%</fact2> of the remaining movies (non-series) are older movies: 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.
The rest are normal-priced non-series movies: 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

Series movies cost <fact5>$6</fact5> each: 200 * <fact5>$6</fact5> = $1200
Older movies cost <fact3>$5</fact3> each: 160 * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $800
Normal movies cost <fact6>$10</fact6> each: 240 * <fact6>$10</fact6> = $2400

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25%</fact3> of the students are cheerleaders or part of the band. How many students are leaving early?


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class: <fact1>30 students</fact1> * <fact2>20%</fact2> = 6 students.

Next, we determine the number of students remaining after the football players are accounted for: <fact1>30 students</fact1> - 6 students = 24 students.

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders and band members from the remaining students: 24 students * <fact3>25%</fact3> = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 students + 6 students = 12 students.

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early.  The answer is {12}.

Answer:
On the first day, Wanda pumped <fact1>1/4</fact1> * <fact2>18000 gallons</fact2> = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact3>3/4</fact3> * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact4>2/3</fact4> * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact5>1/3</fact5> * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the <fact2>tank</fact2> is <fact2>18000 gallons</fact2> - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

George needs to pay for dental work. He needs <fact1>2 implants</fact1>. Each implant has a <fact2>base price of $2000</fact2>. The <fact3>crown costs an extra $500</fact3>. For one of the implants, he wants a <fact4>crown made of porcelain</fact4>. He's already <fact5>put down a deposit of $600</fact5>. He <fact6>makes $15 per hour</fact6> at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?


**Answer:**

The total cost for the implants is <fact1>2 implants</fact1> * <fact2>$2000/implant</fact2> = $4000.

The total cost of the crowns is <fact1>2 implants</fact1> * <fact3>$500/crown</fact3> = $1000. Note that the material of the crown (<fact4>porcelain</fact4>) doesn't affect the price in this problem.

The total cost for the dental work is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

George has already paid a <fact5>deposit of $600</fact5>, so he still needs to pay $5000 - <fact5>$600</fact5> = $4400.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage: $4400 / <fact6>$15/hour</fact6> = 293.33 hours.

Since George can't work fractions of an hour, he needs to work at least 294 hours to have enough money.

But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris <fact2>produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact2>. How <fact3>much does he produce the fourth week</fact3>?

The total number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the first week is <fact2>8,000</fact2>.  In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces <fact2>8,000</fact2> * 3 = 24,000 bars.  The total production for the first three weeks is <fact2>8,000</fact2> + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  Since Boris produces a total of <fact1>50,000 bars each month</fact1>, and assuming a month has four weeks, the number of bars produced in the fourth week is <fact1>50,000</fact1> - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","**Reformatted Question:** A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. <fact1>A fifth of the jellyfish are large</fact1>, and <fact2>a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light</fact2>. When a UV light turned on, <fact3>6 jellyfish changed color</fact3>. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?

**Answer:**

We know from <fact3>the question that 6 large jellyfish changed color</fact3> when the UV light was turned on. <fact2>These 6 jellyfish represent one-third of all the large jellyfish</fact2>.  Therefore, the total number of large jellyfish is 6 jellyfish * 3 = 18 jellyfish.

<fact1>The question states that large jellyfish make up one-fifth of the total jellyfish in the tank</fact1>.  So, if 18 jellyfish represent one-fifth of the total, the total number of jellyfish is 18 jellyfish * 5 = 90 jellyfish.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank. The answer is {90}.

Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was <fact1>losing 9% of the total capacity each hour</fact1>. In the end, the charge remaining was <fact2>28%</fact2>. <fact3>5 hours after</fact3> charging, the battery started to <fact4>lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours</fact4>. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer:
Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as 'x'.

First, the power bank lost 9% per hour for 5 hours (<fact3>5 hours after</fact3>). So the total percentage lost during this period is 9% * 5 = 45%.

Then, the power bank lost 7% per hour for 3 hours (<fact4>lose instead 7% ... for about 3 hours</fact4>). So the total percentage lost during this period is 7% * 3 = 21%.

The total percentage lost is 45% + 21% = 66%.

The final charge is given as 28% (<fact2>charge remaining was 28%</fact2>). This means that x - 66% = 28%.

Therefore, the initial charge 'x' was 28% + 66% = 94%.  So the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The answer is {94}.

She also drops <fact10>1 of these flowers</fact10>.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?


                    Answer:
Initially, Rose picks <fact1>3 flowers</fact1> with <fact2>5 petals</fact2> each, totaling 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then, she picks <fact3>4 flowers</fact3> with <fact4>6 petals</fact4> each, totaling 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Next, she picks <fact5>5 flowers</fact5> with <fact6>4 petals</fact6> each, totaling 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

She drops <fact7>one of each type of flower</fact7>, losing 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals.

Finally, she picks <fact8>6 flowers</fact8> with <fact9>7 petals</fact9> each, totaling 6 * 7 = 42 petals, but drops <fact10>1 flower</fact10>, losing 7 petals.

The total number of petals in the vase is (15 + 24 + 20 - 15) + (42 - 7) = 44 + 35 = 79 petals.  The answer is {79}.

They can fit <fact3>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact3>. They also have <fact4>10 boxes of stuff</fact4> already. If they already own <fact5>15 tables</fact5>, how many new tables do they need?

**Answer:**

First, we calculate the total number of boxes donated:  <fact1>10 people</fact1> * <fact2>5 boxes/person</fact2> = 50 boxes.

Then we add the boxes they already have: 50 boxes + <fact4>10 boxes</fact4> = 60 boxes.

Next, we figure out how many tables they need in total: 60 boxes / <fact3>2 boxes/table</fact3> = 30 tables.

Finally, we subtract the number of tables they already own to find how many more they need: 30 tables - <fact5>15 tables</fact5> = 15 tables.

The answer is {15}.

Mr. Tan sold his house for <fact1>$400,000</fact1>. He paid transfer fees that amount to <fact2>3%</fact2> of the <fact3>selling price</fact3> and also paid a brokerage fee that is <fact4>5%</fact4> of the <fact3>selling price</fact3>.  If he also paid <fact5>$250,000</fact5> for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?


**Answer:**

1. **Calculate total percentage of fees:** Mr. Tan paid a total of <fact2>3%</fact2> + <fact4>5%</fact4> = 8% of the <fact3>selling price</fact3> in fees.

2. **Calculate total fees:** 8% of <fact1>$400,000</fact1> (the <fact3>selling price</fact3>) is (8/100) * <fact1>$400,000</fact1> = $32,000.

3. **Calculate net proceeds before loan repayment:**  Mr. Tan received <fact1>$400,000</fact1> from the sale and paid $32,000 in fees, leaving him with <fact1>$400,000</fact1> - $32,000 = $368,000.

                    Answer:
The shirt costs <fact2>$25</fact2> and is <fact3>30%</fact3> off.  So the discount on the shirt is <fact2>25</fact2> * <fact3>0.30</fact3> = $7.50.  The price of the shirt after the discount is <fact2>$25</fact2> - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the outfit is the cost of the shirt after the discount plus the cost of the shorts, so $17.50 + <fact4>$35</fact4> = $52.50.

Joe started with <fact1>$50</fact1> and the outfit cost $52.50.  Since <fact5>sales tax is included</fact5>, Joe will need an additional $52.50 - <fact1>$50</fact1> = $2.50 to purchase the outfit.

She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  The returned item cost <fact6>$15.00</fact6>. What is the new balance on her credit card?


**Answer:**

1. **Initial balance:** Sheila started with a balance of <fact1>$85.00</fact1>.

2. **Return:** She returned an item worth <fact6>$15.00</fact6>, reducing her balance to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

3. **Frying pan discount:** The frying pan originally cost <fact3>$20.00</fact3>, but was on sale for <fact2>20%</fact2> off.  The discount amount is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

4. **Towel discount:** The towels originally cost <fact5>$30.00</fact5>, but were on sale for <fact4>10%</fact4> off. The discount amount is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. So, the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The hotel's normal price is <fact3>$1500</fact3> per day, but it's <fact1>20%</fact1> more expensive this weekend.  So, the daily cost is <fact3>$1500</fact3> * 1.20 = $1800.

They are staying for <fact6>3 days</fact6>, so the total hotel cost is $1800 * <fact6>3</fact6> = $5400.

The <fact4>plane tickets</fact4> cost <fact5>$5000 each</fact5>, and since there are two of them, the total ticket cost is <fact5>$5000</fact5> * 2 = $10000.

The total trip cost is the hotel cost plus the ticket cost: $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

The answer is {15400}.

Mark is a copy-editor. Mark edits a total number of <fact1>1000 sentences</fact1> each week, and <fact2>Publisher A</fact2> pays him <fact3>5 cents per sentence</fact3>. <fact4>Publisher B</fact4> pays Mark <fact5>twice</fact5> what <fact2>Publisher A</fact2> pays. He edits an <fact6>equal number of sentences</fact6> each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?


**Answer:**

Mark edits a total of <fact1>1000 sentences</fact1> and edits an <fact6>equal number for each publisher</fact6>, so he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.  <fact2>Publisher A</fact2> pays him <fact3>5 cents per sentence</fact3>, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A. <fact4>Publisher B</fact4> pays <fact5>twice</fact5> what <fact2>Publisher A</fact2> pays, meaning Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence.  Therefore, he earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.  In total, Mark makes 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents per week. The answer is {7500}.

How many friends can she invite?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Morgan's dad said that she had <fact1>$90 budgeted</fact1> for her birthday party. A round of mini-golf is <fact2>$5</fact2>. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have <fact3>$5 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and get to ride the go-karts twice. The Go-karts cost <fact4>$10 a ride</fact4>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer:
Let's break down the costs per person:

* Mini-golf: <fact2>$5</fact2>
* Arcade tokens: <fact3>$5</fact3>
* Go-karts: <fact4>$10</fact4> per ride * 2 rides = $20

Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan has a total budget of <fact1>$90</fact1>.  To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide her budget by the cost per person: $90 / $30 = 3

Since the calculation includes Morgan herself, she can invite 3 - 1 = 2 friends.

There are <fact1>12 team members</fact1> and each brings <fact3>2 guests</fact3>, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
Total number of people at the soccer game is <fact1>12 team members</fact1> + 24 guests + <fact2>3 coaches</fact2> = 39 people.
Since each <fact4>pizza serves 3 people</fact4>, Maddy needs to buy 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.
As <fact5>each pizza costs $15</fact5>, Maddy will spend 13 * $15 = $195.

Mrs. Cruz saw a property that has a selling price of <fact1>$350,000</fact1>. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is <fact2>5%</fact2> of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is <fact3>12%</fact3> of the selling price. Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her <fact4>$400,000</fact4> budget. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?


**Answer:**

The brokerage fee is <fact2>5%</fact2> of <fact1>$350,000</fact1>, which is (5/100) * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is <fact3>12%</fact3> of <fact1>$350,000</fact1>, which is (12/100) * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the selling price (<fact1>$350,000</fact1>) plus the brokerage fee ($17,500) plus the transfer fee ($42,000).  So, the total price is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is <fact4>$400,000</fact4>.  The total price of the house ($409,500) exceeds her budget by $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

A blog article takes an average of <fact1>4 hours</fact1> to research and write about. Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. Last week, on Wednesday, she wrote <fact2>twice</fact2> the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote <fact3>5 articles</fact3> on Monday and <fact4>2/5 times</fact4> more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Calculate the <fact5>total number of hours</fact5> she spent writing articles in the <fact6>three days</fact6>.


The number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday is calculated by multiplying the number of articles she wrote on Monday (<fact3>5</fact3>) by <fact4>2/5</fact4>: 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles.

On Wednesday, Meredith wrote <fact2>twice</fact2> the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 articles.

The total number of articles written over the <fact6>three days</fact6> is the sum of articles written on Monday (<fact3>5</fact3>), Tuesday (2), and Wednesday (4): 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 articles.

Since each article takes <fact1>4 hours</fact1> to write, the <fact5>total number of hours</fact5> spent writing is 11 * 4 = 44 hours.


Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 44 hours writing articles in the three days.

In the class, there are <student1>Adam</student1>, <student2>Martha</student2>, <student3>Betty</student3>, and <student4>Tom</student4>. <student1>Adam</student1> has collected <adam_points>50 points</adam_points>. <student2>Marta</student2> managed to collect <martha_tom_relation>3 times more points than Tom</martha_tom_relation>, who has <tom_betty_relation>30 points less than Betty</tom_betty_relation>. <student3>Betty</student3> was better than <student1>Adam</student1> and collected <betty_adam_relation>30% more</betty_adam_relation>. How many points is the class <missing_points>missing</missing_points> to go on the trip if the <threshold>minimum threshold is 400 points</threshold>?


**Answer:**

1. **Betty's points:** <student3>Betty</student3> scored 30% more than <student1>Adam</student1>'s <adam_points>50 points</adam_points>, so she has <adam_points>50</adam_points> * 1.30 = 65 points.

2. **Tom's points:** <student4>Tom</student4> has <tom_betty_relation>30 points less than Betty</tom_betty_relation>, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

3. **Martha's points:** <student2>Martha</student2> scored <martha_tom_relation>3 times more than Tom</martha_tom_relation>, so she earned 35 * 3 = 105 points.

4. **Total class points:**  The class has a total of <adam_points>50</adam_points> (Adam) + 105 (Martha) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) = 255 points.

5. **Points needed:** The class needs <threshold>400 points</threshold> to go on the trip, and they currently have 255. Therefore, they are <missing_points>missing</missing_points> 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out <fact1>17 fish</fact1> out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <fact2>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact2>. Bob <fact3>started with 7 fish</fact3> in his pond. <fact4>3 were orange</fact4>, and <fact5>4 were white</fact5>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?


**Answer:**

Let 'w' be the number of white fish Bob bought and 'o' be the number of orange fish he bought.  We know from <fact1>the question</fact1> that he bought a total of <fact1>17 fish</fact1>, so:

w + o = 17

Bob started with <fact5>4 white fish</fact5> and bought 'w' more, so he now has 4 + w white fish. He started with <fact4>3 orange fish</fact4> and bought 'o' more, so he now has 3 + o orange fish. The question states (<fact2>) that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish:

3 + o = 2 * (4 + w)

We have two equations:

1) w + o = 17
2) 3 + o = 8 + 2w  =>  o = 5 + 2w

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):

w + (5 + 2w) = 17
3w + 5 = 17
3w = 12
w = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer:
The manufacturer needs to produce <fact1>400 toys</fact1>, and after the <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, they still need <fact4>20 more</fact4>.  This means they produced 400 - <fact4>20</fact4> = 380 toys during the shift.
Two workers produce <fact6>6 toys/hour</fact6> each, so together they produce <fact5>2</fact5> * <fact6>6</fact6> = 12 toys/hour.
Another two workers produce <fact8>4 toys/hour</fact8> each, so they make <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>4</fact8> = 8 toys/hour.
Together, these four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys/hour.
Over the <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, these four workers produced 20 * <fact3>10</fact3> = 200 toys.
Since 380 toys were made in total, the fifth worker made 380 - 200 = 180 toys during the <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>.
Therefore, the fifth worker produces 180 / <fact3>10</fact3> = 18 toys per hour.

First, calculate the volume of the jar: <fact6>6 inches</fact6> * <fact6>6 inches</fact6> * <fact7>15 inches</fact7> = 540 cubic inches.

Next, account for the <fact3>80% packing efficiency</fact3>: 540 cubic inches * <fact3>0.80</fact3> = 432 cubic inches of jelly beans.

Now, determine the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar: 432 cubic inches / <fact2>0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean</fact2> = 2880 jelly beans.

Then, calculate the estimated number of <fact1>red jelly beans</fact1>: 2880 jelly beans * <fact4>0.30</fact4> = 864 red jelly beans.

John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home. He gets a loan worth <fact1>40%</fact1> of his house. He uses <fact2>60%</fact2> of that to pay off his debts. His house is worth <fact3>$250,000</fact3>. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?


**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the loan amount:** John's loan is <fact1>40%</fact1> of his <fact3>$250,000</fact3> house, which is 0.40 * <fact3>$250,000</fact3> = $100,000.

2. **Calculate the amount used to pay off debt:** John uses <fact2>60%</fact2> of the $100,000 loan to pay off debt, which is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

3. **Calculate the leftover amount:** John had $100,000 and used $60,000 to pay off debt, so he has $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover.

The answer is {40000}.

82,"An air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","**Reformatted Question:**

An air conditioner ran on low for <fact1>3 hours</fact1>, then it was turned up to high for <fact2>4 hours</fact2>. Afterward, it was turned off for <fact3>2 hours</fact3>. The air conditioner cools the room <fact4>2 degrees an hour on low</fact4> and <fact5>3 degrees an hour on high</fact5>. The room will warm up at <fact6>2 degrees an hour</fact6> with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

**Answer:**

Here's how we can calculate the final temperature difference:

1. **Cooling on Low:** The AC ran on low for <fact1>3 hours</fact1> and cools at <fact4>2 degrees per hour</fact4>. So, the temperature decreased by <fact1>3</fact1> * <fact4>2</fact4> = 6 degrees.

2. **Cooling on High:**  The AC then ran on high for <fact2>4 hours</fact2> and cools at <fact5>3 degrees per hour</fact5>. So, the temperature decreased by <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact5>3</fact5> = 12 degrees.

3. **Total Cooling:** The total temperature decrease from the AC running was 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. **Warming Up:** The AC was off for <fact3>2 hours</fact3>, and the room warms at <fact6>2 degrees per hour</fact6>.  So, the temperature increased by <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact6>2</fact6> = 4 degrees.

5. **Final Difference:**  The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the warming: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.  So the answer is {14}.

**Answer:**

Jason needs to sell <fact5>15 cars</fact5>. Since <fact2>one out of every two customers buys a car</fact2> (<fact1>one car per two customers</fact1>), he needs 15 cars * <fact1>2 customers/car</fact1> = 30 customers to visit the dealership.

Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. Each pitcher holds <fact1>12 cups</fact1> of lemonade. She spends <fact2>$18</fact2> to buy enough supplies to make <fact3>3 pitchers</fact3> of lemonade.  She sells each cup of lemonade for <fact4>$1</fact4>. She sells an average of <fact5>4 cups</fact5> per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Answer:
Millie can make <fact3>3 pitchers</fact3> * <fact1>12 cups/pitcher</fact1> = 36 cups of lemonade.  She sells each cup for <fact4>$1</fact4>, so she will make 36 cups * <fact4>$1/cup</fact4> = $36 in revenue. Her profit is her revenue minus her costs, so her profit will be $36 - <fact2>$18</fact2> = $18. Since she sells <fact5>4 cups per hour</fact5>, it will take her 36 cups / <fact5>4 cups/hour</fact5> = 9 hours to sell all of the lemonade. Therefore, her profit per hour will be $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour. The answer is {2}.

Answer:
Tim needs <fact2>1 cup of juice</fact2> for <fact3>each gallon of lemonade</fact3>.  Since he is making <fact4>4 gallons</fact4>, he needs 4 * <fact2>1</fact2> = 4 cups of lemon juice.

What is their average guess?

**Answer:**

The first friend guessed <fact3>80</fact3> jelly beans.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend, which is <fact3>80</fact3> + (<fact1>25%</fact1> of <fact3>80</fact3>) = 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

The second friend guessed 20 more than half the first friend's guess.  Half of the first friend's guess is <fact3>80</fact3> / 2 = 40.  Adding <fact2>20</fact2> to this, the second friend guessed 40 + <fact2>20</fact2> = 60 jelly beans.

To find the average guess, we add the three guesses together and divide by 3: (80 + 100 + 60) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

If he watched <fact7>7 hours</fact7> of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer:
Let's calculate Frankie's total TV time excluding Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched <fact1>1 hour</fact1> + <fact2>1 hour</fact2> = 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched <fact4>1 hour</fact4> + <fact5>30 minutes</fact5> = 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched <fact6>2 hours</fact6>.  So in total, excluding Wednesday, he watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

He watched a total of <fact7>7 hours</fact7>.  Therefore, on Wednesday, he watched <fact7>7</fact7> - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday was <fact3>30 minutes</fact3> long, he watched 1.5 hours * (60 minutes/hour) / <fact3>30 minutes/episode</fact3> = 3 episodes.

To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted <fact1>10 more White Oak trees</fact1> and <fact2>1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees</fact2> on the second day than he planted on the first day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>twenty trees of White Oak</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak</fact4>. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.


**Answer:**

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>20 White Oak trees</fact3>. He also planted <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees</fact4>, meaning he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. This gives a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

His work is <fact3>30 miles away</fact3> and he has to <fact4>go there and back each day</fact4>. He gets charged <fact5>$2 per mile driven</fact5> and he also gives his driver a <fact6>$150 bonus per month</fact6>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

The total number of days John goes to work in a year is <fact1>5 days/week</fact1> * <fact2>50 weeks/year</fact2> = 250 days.

Since he travels to and from work each day, the total distance he travels each day is <fact3>30 miles</fact3> * <fact4>2</fact4> = 60 miles.

His yearly mileage is 60 miles/day * 250 days = 15,000 miles.

His yearly cost for mileage is 15,000 miles * <fact5>$2/mile</fact5> = $30,000.

His yearly bonus is <fact6>$150/month</fact6> * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Therefore, John pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 per year for driving.

Answer: {31800}.

Originally, he wanted to make <fact4>twice as many</fact4> as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Answer:
Henry has <fact3>110 cookies</fact3> after dropping <fact2>5</fact2>.  This means he baked 110 + <fact2>5</fact2> = 115 cookies.  He baked <fact1>15 more</fact1> than he intended, so he meant to bake 115 - <fact1>15</fact1> = 100 cookies. He wanted to bake <fact4>twice</fact4> as many as last year, meaning he baked 100 / <fact4>2</fact4> = 50 cookies last year. The answer is {50}.

The cost for these extra hours would be 5 * <fact7>70 pesos</fact7> = 350 pesos. The total cost for Cameron's stay would be <fact3>1000 pesos</fact3> + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

There is a <fact3>50%</fact3> chance that Marcus will have a <fact4>substitute teacher</fact4> who won't collect the homework, so there is a 100% - <fact3>50%</fact3> = 50% chance that the <fact1>normal teacher</fact1> will come. If the <fact1>normal teacher</fact1> comes, there is a <fact2>40%</fact2> chance of a class-wide extension. This means there is a 100% - <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60% chance the class won't get an extension. In that case, Marcus has a <fact5>20%</fact5> chance of getting a personal extension, which means he has a 100% - <fact5>20%</fact5> = 80% chance of having to turn in the homework.
The chance of the <fact1>normal teacher</fact1> coming AND no class extension AND no personal extension is 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%.
So there is a 24% chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework. The answer is {24}.

She trades <fact12>90% of her small stickers</fact12> for <fact13>large buttons</fact13>. How many buttons does she have by the end?


Answer:
Lorraine starts with <fact8>40 large stickers</fact8>.  She trades <fact9>50%</fact9> of them, which is <fact8>40</fact8> * 0.5 = 20 large stickers for <fact10>large buttons</fact10>. This gives her 20 large buttons. She trades the other 20 large stickers for <fact2>small buttons</fact2>, getting 20 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 60 small buttons.

Lorraine begins with <fact7>30 small stickers</fact7>. She trades <fact12>90%</fact12> of them, meaning she trades <fact7>30</fact7> * 0.9 = 27 small stickers for <fact13>large buttons</fact13>. Since each small sticker is worth <fact4>one small button</fact4>, she could have traded them for 27 small buttons. However, since a <fact5>large button</fact5> is worth <fact6>three small stickers</fact6>, she can trade sets of 3 small stickers for a large button.  This gives her 27 / <fact6>3</fact6> = 9 large buttons.

In total, Lorraine has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.  This is a total of 29 + 60 = 89 buttons.

Each letter is <fact3>5 pages</fact3> long, so that's 12 letters * <fact3>5 pages</fact3> = 60 pages.
He can write a page every <fact1>6 minutes</fact1>, so 60 pages * <fact1>6 minutes per page</fact1> = 360 minutes.
To convert to hours: 360 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours.

Toby is reading a book that is <fact1>45 pages</fact1> long. It averages <fact2>200 words a page</fact2>. Toby can read at a rate of <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3>. It takes <fact4>10 minutes</fact4> to get to the airport. He has to be at the airport in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?


**Answer:**

The book has <fact1>45 pages</fact1> and <fact2>200 words per page</fact2>, so it contains 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby reads at a rate of <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3>, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read the book.

It takes <fact4>10 minutes</fact4> to get to the airport, and he needs to be there in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>. This means he has 60 - 10 = 50 minutes available before he needs to leave for the airport.

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read and he has 50 minutes available, he will be 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The answer is {20}.

(Round to the nearest integer.)


**Answer:**

Antoine uses <fact2>double</fact2> the amount of onions in the recipe, so he needs <fact1>2</fact1> * <fact2>2</fact2> = 4 pounds of onions.  The onions cost <fact3>$2.00</fact3> per pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 * <fact3>$2.00</fact3> = $8.00. The beef stock costs <fact6>$2.00</fact6> per box, and he needs <fact5>2 boxes</fact5>, so the total cost of the beef stock is <fact5>2</fact5> * <fact6>$2.00</fact6> = $4.00.  The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.  The soup serves <fact4>6 people</fact4>, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / <fact4>6</fact4> = $2.00. The answer is {2}.

He sells each jar for <fact4>$50</fact4>.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes <fact5>2 pounds</fact5> of passion fruit and <fact6>1.5 pounds</fact6> of jackfruit.  It also takes <fact7>2 pounds</fact7> of special honey.  How much profit does he make selling <fact8>10 jars</fact8>?


                    Answer:
The cost of passion fruit for one jar is <fact5>2 pounds</fact5> * <fact1>$6/pound</fact1> = $12.
The cost of jackfruit for one jar is <fact6>1.5 pounds</fact6> * <fact2>$8/pound</fact2> = $12.
The cost of honey for one jar is <fact7>2 pounds</fact7> * <fact3>$10/pound</fact3> = $20.

The total cost to make one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.
The total cost to make <fact8>10 jars</fact8> is $44 * <fact8>10</fact8> = $440.

The revenue from selling <fact8>10 jars</fact8> is <fact4>$50/jar</fact4> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> = $500.
The profit from selling <fact8>10 jars</fact8> is $500 - $440 = $60.

Tom went on a <fact1>two-week-long</fact1> trip through Europe. On the <fact2>seventh day</fact2>, he wasn't traveling at all. In the <fact3>first 4 days</fact3>, he traveled <fact4>200 kilometers every day</fact4>, and over the <fact5>next two days</fact5>, he totaled only <fact6>30%</fact6> of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the <fact7>second week</fact7>, he made <fact8>300 kilometers every day</fact8>. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his <fact1>two-week-long trip</fact1>?

                    Answer:
In the <fact3>first 4 days</fact3>, Tom traveled <fact4>200 kilometers/day</fact4> * <fact3>4 days</fact3> = 800 kilometers.

Over the <fact5>next two days</fact5>, he traveled <fact6>30%</fact6> of 800 kilometers, which is 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

Since he didn't travel on the <fact2>seventh day</fact2>, the total distance in the first week is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

In the <fact7>second week</fact7>, he traveled <fact8>300 kilometers/day</fact8> for 7 days (since a week has 7 days), which is <fact8>300</fact8> * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his <fact1>two-week-long trip</fact1> is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

How many <target>boys</target> are in the <target>third class</target>?


**Answer:**

1. **Total students:** There are <fact1>3 classes</fact1> with <fact2>20 students</fact2> each, so there are <fact1>3</fact1> * <fact2>20</fact2> = 60 students in the school.

2. **Total girls:** Since the school is <fact5>50% girls</fact5>, there are 60 students * 0.50 = 30 girls in total.

3. **Girls in the third class:** The first class has <fact3>15 girls</fact3> and the second class has <fact4>12 girls</fact4>.  This means there are 30 total girls - <fact3>15</fact3> - <fact4>12</fact4> = 3 girls in the third class.

How many slices of pizza were left?

**Answer:**

There were a total of 5 people (Bryce + 4 friends), and each person ordered a pizza, thus 5 total pizzas. Each pizza had <fact3>12 slices</fact3>, so 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices total.

<fact1>Bryce and two friends (3 people) ate 2/3 of their pizzas</fact1>. That's 3 people * 12 slices/pizza * (2/3) = 24 slices eaten.

<fact2>The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas</fact2>. That's 2 people * 12 slices/pizza * (3/4) = 18 slices eaten.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 total slices - 42 slices eaten = 18 slices.

Therefore, the answer is {18}.

Answer:
The cost of the plane itself was <fact3>$150,000</fact3>.  The hanger rental costs <fact1>$5000</fact1> per month. Over <fact4>a year</fact4> (12 months), the hanger cost is <fact1>$5000</fact1> * 12 = $60,000.

His fuel cost over <fact4>the year</fact4> is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.  The total cost for the <fact4>first year</fact4> is the sum of the plane cost, hanger cost, and fuel cost: <fact3>$150,000</fact3> + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.  The answer is {330000}.

James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. James currently has <fact1>4 toys</fact1> on hand for <fact2>4 dogs</fact2>, but there are <fact3>8 more dogs</fact3> in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are <fact4>twice as many more dogs</fact4> than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, <fact5>3 dogs were gone</fact5> so he no longer needed those toys. <fact6>Each dog needs one toy</fact6>. How many toys in total does James need?


Initially, James has <fact2>4 dogs</fact2> and <fact1>4 toys</fact1>. Then <fact3>8 more dogs</fact3> arrive, bringing the total to 4 + <fact3>8</fact3> = 12 dogs. Since <fact6>each dog needs one toy</fact6>, James needs 12 toys. He buys 12 - <fact1>4</fact1> = 8 toys.

Next, the number of dogs doubles, so there are now 12 * <fact4>2</fact4> = 24 dogs. This means James needs 24 toys.  He needs to buy an additional 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

Finally, <fact5>3 dogs leave</fact5>, leaving 24 - <fact5>3</fact5> = 21 dogs. Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys.

Cole hid <fact1>3 dozen</fact1> eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>.  And Mei finds <fact3>half as many as Charlie</fact3>. Stacy finds <fact4>twice as many as Lamar</fact4>.  Charlie finds <fact5>2 less than Stacy</fact5>.  <question>How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?</question>

Answer:
First, we need to figure out how many eggs were hidden initially.  A dozen contains 12 eggs, so <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, let's determine how many eggs each person found.
Lamar found <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>.
Stacy found <fact4>twice as many as Lamar</fact4>, meaning she found 2 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 10 eggs.
Charlie found <fact5>2 less than Stacy</fact5>, so he found 10 - <fact5>2</fact5> = 8 eggs.
Mei found <fact3>half as many as Charlie</fact3>, meaning she found 8 / <fact3>2</fact3> = 4 eggs.

In total, the number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since there were 36 eggs initially and 27 were found, the number of eggs still hidden is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.  Therefore, the answer is {9}.

Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee. He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses <fact1>1 pound of coffee per day</fact1>. The normal brand of coffee he buys costs <fact2>$5 per pound</fact2>.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost <fact3>20% more</fact3> since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for <fact4>$2</fact4>. How much did everything cost?


**Answer:**

Roger drinks <fact1>1 pound of coffee per day</fact1> and buys enough for a week, so he buys 1 * 7 = 7 pounds of coffee.  The more expensive coffee costs <fact3>20%</fact3> more than the usual price of <fact2>$5</fact2> per pound. This means the new price per pound is $5 * 1.20 = $6. Therefore, the coffee costs 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.  Adding the cost of the donut, <fact4>$2</fact4>, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44. The answer is {44}.

Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. <fact1>Four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>. <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>.  <fact3>Half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>. <fact4>Six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>. <fact5>Twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

**Answer:**

1. **Size Small:** <fact5>Twice as many students need size small as extra-small</fact5>, and <fact2>11 students need extra-small</fact2>.  So, 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.

2. **Size Medium:** <fact1>Four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>. There are 22 small shirts, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

3. **Size Large:** <fact3>Half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>. There are 18 medium shirts, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

4. **Size Extra-Large:** <fact4>Six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>. There are 9 large shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

5. **Total Shirts:** To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add the number of shirts needed in each size: 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) + 11 (extra-small) = 75 shirts.

Therefore, Krissa ordered 75 shirts.

Colby loves going to the movies and already saw <fact1>5 movies</fact1> on a <fact2>Friday or Saturday</fact2>, <fact3>8 movies</fact3> on <fact4>other days</fact4>, had <fact5>2 tubs of popcorn</fact5>, and <fact6>four boxes of candy</fact6> this month. Tickets for <fact2>Fridays and Saturdays</fact2> cost <fact7>$10</fact7>. Tickets for any other day cost <fact8>$7</fact8>.

He wants to make sure he gets a <fact12>popcorn and box of candy</fact12> that night. <question>How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies?</question>


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate how much Colby has already spent this month. He saw <fact1>5 movies</fact1> on <fact2>Friday or Saturday</fact2> at <fact7>$10</fact7> each, costing him 5 * $10 = $50. He also saw <fact3>8 movies</fact3> on <fact4>other days</fact4> at <fact8>$7</fact8> each, costing him 8 * $7 = $56.  He bought <fact5>2 tubs of popcorn</fact5> at <fact9>$8</fact9> each, costing him 2 * $8 = $16, and <fact6>four boxes of candy</fact6> at <fact10>$2</fact10> each, costing him 4 * $2 = $8. In total, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

His parents give him $150, and he's already spent $130, leaving him with $150 - $130 = $20.  Since it's a <fact2>Friday</fact2> (<fact11>last day of the month</fact11>) and he wants <fact12>popcorn and candy</fact12>, he needs to set aside <fact9>$8</fact9> + <fact10>$2</fact10> = $10 for those. This leaves him $20 - $10 = $10 for movie tickets. Since Friday tickets cost <fact7>$10</fact7>, he can afford one more movie.

Therefore, Colby can see 1 more movie on Friday.

Chad has a gift card for <gift_card>$5.00</gift_card> that he uses at check out. He ordered a build-your-own burrito for lunch. He adds extra meat for <extra_meat>$2.00</extra_meat>, extra cheese for <extra_cheese>$1.00</extra_cheese>, avocado for <avocado>$1.00</avocado> and 2 sauces for <sauces>$0.25</sauces> each.

How much does he still owe, if the <base_burrito>base burrito is $6.50</base_burrito>?

The base burrito costs <base_burrito>$6.50</base_burrito>.
The extra meat costs <extra_meat>$2.00</extra_meat>.
The extra cheese costs <extra_cheese>$1.00</extra_cheese>.
The avocado costs <avocado>$1.00</avocado>.
The two sauces cost 2 * <sauces>$0.25</sauces> = $0.50.
The meal upgrade costs <meal_upgrade>$3.00</meal_upgrade>.

The total cost of the burrito and additions is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a <gift_card>$5.00</gift_card> gift card.  Therefore, he still owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

How many ounces of oil does she use?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses <fact1>the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and <fact2>the same amount of salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3> each time. She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Let's use variables:
* Z = amount of zest
* F = amount of fragrance
* S = amount of salt
* Su = amount of sugar
* O = amount of oil

From <fact1>, we know Z = F.
From <fact2>, we know S = Su.
From <fact5>, we know S = 2Z.
From <fact4>, we know O = 2S.

Since the total amount of ingredients is <fact3>10 ounces</fact3>, we have Z + F + S + Su + O = 10.

Substitute the known relationships:
Z + Z + S + S + O = 10
2Z + 2S + O = 10

Now substitute S = 2Z:
2Z + 2(2Z) + O = 10
2Z + 4Z + O = 10
6Z + O = 10

Finally, substitute O = 2S = 2(2Z) = 4Z:
6Z + 4Z = 10
10Z = 10
Z = 1

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
O = 4Z = 4 * 1 = 4 ounces

**Answer:**

The sunflowers need <fact5>4</fact5> * <fact3>3 pounds/sunflower</fact3> = 12 pounds of soil.  The carnations need <fact6>10</fact6> * <fact4>1.5 pounds/carnation</fact4> = 15 pounds of soil.

If the <fact9>number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station</fact9>, calculate the <fact10>total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus</fact10>.


**Answer:**

1. **Passengers after the first stop:** <fact3>Initially</fact3>, there were <fact3>20 people</fact3> on the bus.  At the <fact4>first stop</fact4>, <fact5>40 people</fact5> boarded. So, the total number of passengers became 20 + 40 = 60 people.

2. **Passengers after the second stop:** At the <fact6>second stop</fact6>, <fact7>3/4</fact7> of the <fact5>40 people</fact5> who boarded at the <fact4>first stop</fact4> entered, which is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people.  The total number of passengers became 60 + 30 = 90 people.

3. **Passengers after the third stop:** The <fact9>number of passengers doubled</fact9> at the third station.  So, the total number of passengers became 90 * 2 = 180 people.

4. **Remaining spaces:** The bus has a capacity of <fact1>200 people</fact1>.  Currently, there are 180 people on board.  Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces is 200 - 180 = 20 people.  This addresses the question of <fact10>how many more people are needed to fill the bus</fact10>.

She also has five <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> she bought for <fact5>$16 each</fact5>. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer:
The cost of the <fact2>2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> was 10 boards * <fact3>$10/board</fact3> = $100.  The cost of the <fact4>4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> was 5 boards * <fact5>$16/board</fact5> = $80.  Her total initial cost was $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the price of lumber went up by <fact1>50%</fact1>, she sells the <fact2>2 x 4 x 10</fact2> boards for <fact3>$10</fact3> * 1.5 = $15 each.  So, she makes 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

How many medals have been given out for counting?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Ali is a superstar counter. His friend Izzy is also a really good counter and has <fact1>5 less medals than Ali</fact1>. <fact2>Ali has won 22 medals</fact2> for counting super fast. Together they have <fact3>10 times less medals</fact3> than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?


Izzy has <fact2>22</fact2> - <fact1>5</fact1> = 17 medals. Together, Ali and Izzy have <fact2>22</fact2> + 17 = 39 medals. Since they have <fact3>10 times less</fact3> medals than the total number given out, the total number of medals given out is 39 * <fact3>10</fact3> = 390 medals. The answer is {390}.

A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One crate of such fruit consists of <fact1>5 bananas</fact1>, <fact2>12 apples</fact2>, and <fact3>7 oranges</fact3>. <fact4>Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece</fact4>. <fact5>One apple costs $0.5</fact5> and <fact6>one banana costs twice as much</fact6>. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?


**Answer:**

The price of one apple is <fact5>$0.5</fact5>.  A banana costs twice as much as an apple, meaning one banana costs <fact5>$0.5</fact5> * 2 = $1 (<fact6>given</fact6>). An orange costs three times as much as a banana (<fact4>given</fact4>), so one orange costs $1 * 3 = $3.

A crate consists of <fact1>5 bananas</fact1>, so the cost of bananas in a crate is 5 * $1 = $5.  There are <fact2>12 apples</fact2> in a crate, costing 12 * <fact5>$0.5</fact5> = $6. Finally, the <fact3>7 oranges</fact3> cost 7 * $3 = $21.

Therefore, the total price of a crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

As Sally entered school, she found <fact1>8 blue balloons</fact1> caught in a tree, and she added <fact2>75%</fact2> of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  Previously, when she started walking to school, she was holding the strings to <fact3>25 red balloons</fact3>, <fact4>7 green balloons</fact4>, and <fact5>12 yellow balloons</fact5>. At this time, a gust of wind caused <fact6>40%</fact6> of the <fact3>red balloons</fact3> to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the <fact5>yellow balloons</fact5>.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

**Answer:**

1. **Blue balloons added:** Sally added <fact2>75%</fact2> of <fact1>8 blue balloons</fact1> which is (8 * 0.75) = 6 blue balloons.

2. **Red balloons remaining:** <fact6>40%</fact6> of the <fact3>25 red balloons</fact3> burst, meaning (25 * 0.40) = 10 balloons burst.  This leaves 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. **Yellow balloons remaining:** Sally released half of her <fact5>12 yellow balloons</fact5>, meaning she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

4. **Total balloons carried into school:** Sally carried 15 red + <fact4>7 green</fact4> + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons into the school.

The answer is {34}.

How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

There are <fact1>6 periods</fact1> in the day for a normal student. Each class is <fact2>40 minutes</fact2> long. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days</fact3> a week. He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on <fact5>Saturday and Sunday</fact5> as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact6>2 extra classes</fact6> a day?

                    Answer:

A normal student has <fact1>6 periods</fact1> a day, but John takes <fact6>2 extra classes</fact6>, so he has 6 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 8 classes per day.  Each class is <fact2>40 minutes</fact2> long, so he spends 8 * <fact2>40</fact2> = 320 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days</fact3> a week, meaning he spends 320 * <fact3>5</fact3> = 1600 minutes in class each week.  This is his weekly class time.

To calculate his weekend learning time, we need to find his weekly class time in minutes, which we calculated as 1600 minutes. He spends <fact4>1/16</fact4> of this time each on <fact5>Saturday and Sunday</fact5>, so he spends (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes each day of the weekend studying. Since there are two weekend days (<fact5>Saturday and Sunday</fact5>), he spends 100 * 2 = 200 minutes studying on the weekends.

His total weekly learning time is the sum of his weekday class time and weekend study time: 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

The question asks for the answer in hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, his total weekly learning time is 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{30}$

If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","**Reformatted Question:** Mr. Bert gives <fact1>six tests</fact1> each semester. Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to <fact2>remove the lowest score</fact2> from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of <fact3>89, 71, 92, 100 and 86</fact3> on the <fact4>first five tests</fact4>, what score does she need on the <fact5>sixth test</fact5> to get an <fact6>average of 93</fact6>?

**Answer:**

Brinley's lowest score on her <fact4>first five tests</fact4> is <fact3>71</fact3>. Since Mr. Bert drops the lowest score, we <fact2>remove the 71</fact2> from consideration.  The sum of her remaining <fact4>four scores</fact4> is <fact3>89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367</fact3>.

To achieve an <fact6>average of 93</fact6> over <fact1>five tests</fact1> (after the lowest is dropped), the sum of those <fact1>five scores</fact1> must be 93 * 5 = 465.

Let 'x' be the score Brinley needs on her <fact5>sixth test</fact5>.  Since we already know the sum of her four highest scores is 367,  we can set up the equation: 367 + x = 465.

Solving for x, we get x = 465 - 367 = 98. Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on her <fact5>sixth test</fact5> to have an <fact6>average of 93</fact6>. The answer is {98}.

How many bandages did they start with on the first day?


                                                Answer:

Here's how we can figure out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day:

1. **Third Day Calculations:**
    * They ordered two bulk packs, adding 2 * <fact1>50</fact1> = 100 bandages.
    * They used half a pack, meaning they used <fact1>50</fact1> / 2 = 25 bandages.

2. **Second Day Calculations:**
    * They used <fact4>ten fewer</fact4> bandages than the first day, so they used <fact5>38</fact5> - <fact4>10</fact4> = 28 bandages.

3. **First Day Calculations:**
    * They used <fact5>38 bandages</fact5>.
    * They ordered one bulk pack, adding <fact1>50</fact1> bandages.

4. **Working Backwards:**
    * At the end of the third day, they had <fact7>78</fact7> bandages.
    * Before using half a pack on the third day, they had <fact7>78</fact7> + 25 = 103 bandages.
    * Before ordering two bulk packs on the third day, they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages.
    * This means they had 3 bandages at the end of the second day.
    * Before using 28 bandages on the second day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages.
    * This means they had 31 bandages at the end of the first day.
    * Before using 38 bandages and ordering a bulk pack on the first day, they had 31 - <fact1>50</fact1> + <fact5>38</fact5> = 19 bandages.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.  The answer is {19}.

Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives <fact1>2 miles</fact1> away from the school. Steve lives <fact2>3 miles</fact2> from the school and can bike at <fact3>440 feet per minute</fact3>. If Tim can ride his skateboard at <fact4>264 feet per minute</fact4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?


**Answer:**

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, Tim's distance is <fact1>2 miles</fact1> * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. Steve's distance is <fact2>3 miles</fact2> * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet.

Next, we calculate the time it takes each person to get home.  Tim's time is 10560 feet / <fact4>264 feet/minute</fact4> = 40 minutes. Steve's time is 15840 feet / <fact3>440 feet/minute</fact3> = 36 minutes.

Since Steve takes less time (36 minutes) than Tim (40 minutes), Steve wins.  The difference in their times is 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.  Therefore, Steve will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before Tim arrives.

The answer is {4}.

The hamsters used <fact1>10 cages</fact1> * <fact2>5 pieces of straw per hamster</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw.  The rabbits used <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5>.  This means that <fact6>160</fact6> - 50 - <fact5>20</fact5> = 90 pieces of straw were used for the rats. Since <fact4>each rat gets 6 pieces of straw</fact4>, there are 90 / <fact4>6</fact4> = 15 rats in total.  Because the <fact3>rats are divided equally among 3 cages</fact3>, there are 15 / <fact3>3</fact3> = 5 rats per cage.  The answer is {5}.

Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes <fact1>75 large jelly beans</fact1> to fill Grandpa up.  And eating <fact2>3 small beans</fact2> is the same as eating <fact3>1 medium-sized bean</fact3>. He can eat <fact4>twice as many medium-sized beans</fact4> as large beans.

If <fact7>Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop</fact7>, how much money does she have in her purse?


                    Answer:
Here's how to figure out how much money Erika has in her purse:

1. **Calculate the effective price of the laptop:** The original price is <fact6>$600</fact6>, but with the trade-in, it's reduced by <fact3>$200</fact3>.  So, the effective price is $600 - $200 = $400.

2. **Calculate the total amount Erika needs:** Since she needs an extra <fact7>$50</fact7>, she must have $400 - $50 = $350.

3. **Calculate the money Erika has from sources other than her purse:** This includes her mom's contribution of <fact1>$80</fact1> and her paycheck of <fact5>$150</fact5>, totaling $80 + $150 = $230.

4. **Calculate the money in Erika's purse:** Subtract the money Erika has from other sources from the total she needs: $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.  The answer is {120}.

Rani is obsessed with sports cars. She wonders what the fastest car ever made can go so she looks it up. The average car can go <fact1>120 Miles per hour</fact1>. What she finds out is that the fastest car was <fact2>1.25 times faster</fact2> than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was <fact3>5 times faster</fact3> than the average car. How fast does the faster car go?


**Answer:**

The second fastest car goes <fact3>5</fact3> times the speed of an average car.  An average car goes <fact1>120 mph</fact1>. Therefore, the second fastest car can go <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>120 mph</fact1> = 600 mph.

The fastest car is <fact2>1.25</fact2> times faster than the second fastest car. So, the fastest car can go <fact2>1.25</fact2> * 600 mph = 750 mph.

The answer is {750}.

James gets a job selling used cars. He gets a <fact1>10% commission</fact1> on the <fact2>profits</fact2>. He sold <fact3>10 cars</fact3> that cost <fact4>$25,000 each</fact4>. The company paid <fact5>30%</fact5> of the <fact4>price</fact4> to acquire the cars. How much did he make?


**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the total revenue:** James sold <fact3>10 cars</fact3> at <fact4>$25,000 each</fact4>, so the total revenue was <fact3>10</fact3> * <fact4>$25,000</fact4> = $250,000.

2. **Calculate the company's cost:** The company paid <fact5>30%</fact5> of the <fact4>price</fact4> to acquire each car, so the cost per car was <fact5>0.30</fact5> * <fact4>$25,000</fact4> = $7,500.  The total cost for <fact3>10 cars</fact3> is <fact3>10</fact3> * $7,500 = $75,000.

3. **Calculate the profit:** The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

4. **Calculate James's commission:** James earns a <fact1>10% commission</fact1> on the <fact2>profit</fact2>, so he made <fact1>0.10</fact1> * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

Dior took <fact3>4 hours</fact3> + <fact1>well over 4 hours</fact1> to do the laundry.  Since Dior took *well over* 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours, we know Dior's time was over 8 hours.

There are <fact1>100 plants</fact1> in Mrs. Smith's garden.

What percent of the plants are <fact6>flowering plants</fact6>?


**Answer:**

1. **Indoor Plants:** One-fourth (<fact4>1/4</fact4>) of the <fact1>100 plants</fact1> are indoor plants.  This means there are (<fact4>1/4</fact4>) * <fact1>100</fact1> = 25 indoor plants (<fact5>indoor plants</fact5>).

2. **Non-Indoor Plants:** Since there are <fact1>100 total plants</fact1> and 25 <fact5>indoor plants</fact5>, there are <fact1>100</fact1> - 25 = 75 non-indoor plants.

3. **Outdoor Plants:** Two-thirds (<fact2>2/3</fact2>) of the non-indoor plants are outdoor plants. This means there are (<fact2>2/3</fact2>) * 75 = 50 outdoor plants.

4. **Flowering Plants:** The remaining non-indoor plants are flowering plants (<fact3>the rest are flowering plants</fact3>).  Since there are 75 non-indoor plants and 50 are outdoor plants, there are 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants (<fact6>flowering plants</fact6>).

5. **Percentage of Flowering Plants:** To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of <fact6>flowering plants</fact6> (25) by the <fact1>total number of plants</fact1> (100) and multiply by 100%: (25 / <fact1>100</fact1>) * 100% = 25%.

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

**Answer:**

The base installation package covers <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>, <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>, and <fact8>10 pictures</fact8>. Angela needs <fact1>6 mirrors</fact1> so she needs 2 more than the package (<fact1>6</fact1> - <fact5>4</fact5> = 2). She needs <fact2>2 chandeliers</fact2>, meaning she needs 1 more (<fact2>2</fact2> - <fact7>1</fact7> = 1). Finally, she has <fact3>20 pictures</fact3> and the package covers <fact8>10</fact8>, meaning she needs 10 more (<fact3>20</fact3> - <fact8>10</fact8> = 10).

In total, she needs 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items installed beyond the base package.  At a cost of <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9>, these extra installations will cost 13 * <fact9>$15</fact9> = $195.

What is the <fact7>total area</fact7>, in square feet, of the house?


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the area of a single bedroom: <fact6>20 feet</fact6> * <fact6>12 feet</fact6> = 240 square feet.

Since Tom has <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1>, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 square feet = 960 square feet.

The <fact2>living room</fact2> is <fact3>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact3>, so its area is 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

The <fact4>rest of the house</fact4> is <fact5>1000 square feet</fact5>.

Finally, to find the <fact7>total area</fact7> of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, living room, and the rest of the house: 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is {3160}.

He gets a <fact3>20% discount</fact3> on them. He also buys a <fact4>finale firework that costs $150</fact4>. How much did he spend in total?

Answer:
The first pack costs <fact1>$400</fact1>. The second pack costs <fact2>twice</fact2> as much as the first, so it costs <fact1>400</fact1> * 2 = $800.  Together, the two packs cost <fact1>400</fact1> + 800 = $1200. He gets a <fact3>20% discount</fact3>, meaning he saves 1200 * 0.20 = $240. The price after the discount is 1200 - 240 = $960.  Adding the cost of the <fact4>finale firework</fact4>, the total spent is 960 + <fact4>150</fact4> = $1110. The answer is {1110}.

John is a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has <fact1>1/8 the capacity</fact1> of Ali's class. Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class.  <fact2>Ali's class</fact2> has the capacity of <fact3>120 students</fact3>. What is the <fact4>combined capacity</fact4> of both schools?


**Answer:**

Ali's class has a capacity of <fact3>120 students</fact3>.  Each of John's classes has <fact1>1/8</fact1> the capacity of Ali's class, meaning each of John's classes can hold (<fact1>1/8</fact1>) * <fact3>120</fact3> = 15 students. Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is 15 * 2 = 30 students.  The <fact4>combined capacity</fact4> of both schools is the capacity of Ali's class (<fact3>120</fact3>) plus the capacity of John's school (30), which is <fact3>120</fact3> + 30 = 150 students.  The answer is {150}.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?","**Reformatted Question:**

Elaine initially had <fact1>20 Pokemon cards</fact1>. After a month, she collected <fact2>three times</fact2> that number. In the third month, she collected <fact3>twice</fact3> the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected <fact4>20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact4>. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?


**Answer:**

1. **First month's collection:** Elaine collected <fact2>three times</fact2> her initial number of cards, which was <fact1>20</fact1>. So, she collected 3 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 60 cards in the first month.

2. **Second month's collection:** Elaine collected <fact4>20 fewer cards</fact4> than the first month, which means she collected 60 - <fact4>20</fact4> = 40 cards.  It seems there is contradictory information in the prompt. The second month should have a different amount than the first, but it says she collected three times her initial 20 AND 20 fewer than the first month's amount.  We'll consider this amount as 40 for step 3 based on the 2nd month facts and not the ""three times"" part of the question, to reflect the contradictory information.

3. **Third month's collection:** Elaine collected <fact3>twice</fact3> the combined number of cards from the first and second months.  This is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

4. **Total cards:** To find the total number of cards, we add the initial number of cards plus the collections from each month:  <fact1>20</fact1> (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokemon cards.

Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the <fact1>fourth train</fact1> scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The <fact2>first train</fact2> is scheduled to arrive in <fact3>10 minutes</fact3>, and this train will stay in the station for <fact4>20 minutes</fact4>.

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?


                    Answer:
The first train arrives in <fact3>10 minutes</fact3> and stays for <fact4>20 minutes</fact4>, so it leaves after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes. The second train arrives <fact6>half an hour</fact6> (30 minutes) after the first train leaves, meaning it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The second train stays for a <fact7>quarter</fact7> of the time the first train stayed, which is <fact4>20</fact4>/4 = 5 minutes.  So, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The third train arrives <fact10>an hour</fact10> (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, meaning it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The third train leaves <fact11>immediately</fact11>. The fourth train arrives <fact8>20 minutes</fact8> after the third train leaves, meaning it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.  Therefore, Paul waits 145 minutes for his train. The answer is {145}.

**Answer:**

1. **Green cars:** The rink has <fact2>2 fewer green cars</fact2> than <fact1>red cars</fact1>, which means they have <fact1>12</fact1> - <fact2>2</fact2> = 10 green cars.

2. **Blue cars:** They have <fact4>3 times</fact4> the number of <fact5>green cars</fact5> as blue cars. This means they have 10 * <fact4>3</fact4> = 30 blue cars.

3. **Red, green, and blue cars:** In total, they have <fact1>12 red</fact1> + 10 green + 30 blue = 52 red, green, and blue cars.

4. **Yellow cars:** Since the rink has <fact6>75 cars in total</fact6>, and 52 are red, green or blue, the number of <fact3>yellow cars</fact3> is <fact6>75</fact6> - 52 = 23 yellow cars.

Answer:
Mr. Rogers bought the watch for <fact3>75%</fact3> of $<fact2>2000</fact2>, which is 0.75 * $<fact2>2000</fact2> = $1500.

James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <fact1>20-mile</fact1> lake.  He swims <fact2>60%</fact2> of the distance. He can swim at a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer:
James swims <fact2>60%</fact2> of the total <fact1>20-mile</fact1> distance which is 0.60 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 12 miles.
At a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>, it takes him 12 miles / <fact3>2 miles/hour</fact3> = 6 hours to swim this distance.

He rests for <fact4>half</fact4> the swimming time which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is <fact1>20</fact1> miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
His speed for this remaining distance is <fact5>half</fact5> his original speed, which is <fact3>2 miles/hour</fact3> / 2 = 1 mile/hour.
So, it takes him 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.

The total time to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the rest time, and the final swimming time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

**Answer:**

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound cost <fact1>$3</fact1>. The second pound was half-off, so it cost <fact1>$3</fact1> / 2 = $1.50.  The total cost of the taffy was <fact1>$3</fact1> + $1.50 = $4.50.

The <fact4>4</fact4> magnets cost <fact4>4</fact4> * <fact5>$0.25</fact5> = $1.00

Her total spending was $4.50 (taffy) + <fact3>$1.50</fact3> (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of <fact1>$200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5 for each person</fact3> who attends. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Let 'x' be the number of guests.

Cost of the first venue: <fact1>$200</fact1> (flat fee) + <fact3>$5</fact3> * x (food cost per person) = 200 + 5x

Cost of the second venue: <fact2>$25</fact2> * x (cost per person) = 25x

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 10

Therefore, with 10 guests, both venues will cost the same.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{10}$

If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?","**Reformatted Question:**
A farmer is baling hay in their field. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up <fact1>3 bales</fact1> of hay. Each hour the farmer makes <fact2>5 bales</fact2>. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a <fact3>6 hour</fact3> day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?


**Answer:**
The farmer makes <fact2>5 bales</fact2> per hour and works for <fact3>6 hours</fact3>, so they make <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 30 bales of hay.  The truck picks up <fact1>3 bales</fact1> per hour and also works for <fact3>6 hours</fact3>, so it picks up <fact1>3</fact1> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 18 bales.  Since the farmer makes 30 bales and the truck removes 18, there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales left in the field. The answer is {12}.

Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the third set, he retrieved <fact1>half as many balls</fact1> as in the second. He retrieved <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>. In the <fact3>first</fact3> of three sets, he had to retrieve <fact4>four more balls</fact4> than in the second set. <fact5>How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?</fact5>

Let $x$ be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
In the third set, Rory retrieved <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>, which is $x/2$.
In the <fact3>first</fact3> set, Rory retrieved <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>, which is $x+4$.
The total number of balls retrieved is <fact2>19</fact2>.  So we have the equation:
$x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19$
$2x + x/2 + 4 = 19$
$5x/2 + 4 = 19$
$5x/2 = 15$
$5x = 30$
$x = 6$

The number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6.
The number of balls retrieved in the <fact3>first</fact3> set is $x+4 = 6+4 = 10$.
The number of balls retrieved in the third set is $6/2 = 3$.

$10 + 6 + 3 = 19$.

<fact5>How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?</fact5> 10.

The answer is {10}.

                    Answer:                                         The makeup artist charges Jean <fact1>$250 an hour</fact1>.  Each day, the makeup takes <fact2>6 hours</fact2>, so the daily cost is <fact1>$250</fact1> * <fact2>6</fact2> = $1500.  Jean needs her makeup done <fact3>4 times a week</fact3>, so the weekly cost is $1500 * <fact3>4</fact3> = $6000.

If Sara already had <fact6>$10</fact6> saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

**Answer:**

The total cost of the jacket and two pairs of shoes is the cost of the jacket (<fact1>$30</fact1>) plus the cost of two pairs of shoes (2 * <fact2>$20</fact2> = $40), which equals $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara earned <fact4>4</fact4> * <fact5>$5</fact5> = $20 from babysitting.  She already had <fact6>$10</fact6> saved.  So, before mowing any lawns, she has $20 + <fact6>$10</fact6> = $30.

Sara needs $70 total and has $30, so she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Since she earns <fact3>$4</fact3> per lawn mowed, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / <fact3>$4</fact3> = 10 times.

What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs <fact1>$4</fact1>. A 2 x 8 costs <fact2>$6</fact2>.  He can get <fact3>200 sticks</fact3> from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and <fact4>400 sticks</fact4> from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has <fact5>$24</fact5> to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer:
The cost per stick for a 2x4 is <fact1>$4</fact1>/<fact3>200 sticks</fact3> = $0.02/stick.
The cost per stick for a 2x8 is <fact2>$6</fact2>/<fact4>400 sticks</fact4> = $0.015/stick.

Since the 2x8 has a lower cost per stick, it's the cheapest option.

With <fact5>$24</fact5>, he can buy <fact5>$24</fact5>/<fact2>$6</fact2>/2x8 = 4 2x8s.

This will give him 4 2x8s * <fact4>400 sticks</fact4>/2x8 = 1600 sticks.

The answer is {1600}.

                    Answer:
Initially, there were <fact1>12</fact1> sodas, <fact2>3</fact2> of which were shaken.  Ellen's brother took <fact3>1</fact3> shaken soda and <fact4>2</fact4> unshaken sodas, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas and 12 - 3 - 2=7 unshaken sodas.  Ellen then took <fact5>1</fact5> unshaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7-1=6 unshaken sodas. In total, there are now 2 + 6 = 8 sodas remaining. The probability that Ellen's friend grabs a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/8 = 1/4 = 25%. The answer is {25}.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>. The other is an <fact2>unknown temperature</fact2>. If he pours <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> of water from the <fact1>33-degree mug</fact1> into his water bottle and <fact4>one ounce</fact4> from the <fact2>other bottle</fact2>, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at <fact5>least 40 degrees</fact5>.  At least how many degrees is the <fact2>second bottle</fact2>?

Let 'x' be the temperature of the second bottle.
The total amount of water in the bottle is <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> + <fact4>1 ounce</fact4> = 5 ounces.
The weighted average temperature of the mixture must be at <fact5>least 40 degrees</fact5>.  We can represent this with the following inequality:

( (<fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>33</fact1>) + (<fact4>1</fact4> * x) ) / 5 >= <fact5>40</fact5>

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40

132 + x >= 200

x >= 68

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.


The answer is {68}.

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"                    Reformatted Question:                         Answer:

Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>.  Over the <fact2>first year</fact2> it depreciated <fact3>30%</fact3>.  The <fact4>second year</fact4> it depreciated another <fact5>30%</fact5>. Over the <fact6>third year</fact6> it depreciated <fact7>20%</fact7>. How much is the boat worth after the <fact8>three years</fact8>?

After <fact2>the first year</fact2>, the boat depreciated by <fact3>30%</fact3> of its original value (<fact1>$9000</fact1>). This means it lost <fact1>$9000</fact1> * 0.<fact3>30</fact3> = <fact9>$2700</fact9>.  So the boat was worth <fact1>$9000</fact1> - <fact9>$2700</fact9> = <fact10>$6300</fact10>.

After <fact4>the second year</fact4>, the boat depreciated another <fact5>30%</fact5>, but this time it's <fact5>30%</fact5> of the new value (<fact10>$6300</fact10>). This depreciation is <fact10>$6300</fact10> * 0.<fact5>30</fact5> = <fact11>$1890</fact11>. Thus the value becomes <fact10>$6300</fact10> - <fact11>$1890</fact11> = <fact12>$4410</fact12>.


Finally, after <fact6>the third year</fact6>, the boat depreciated <fact7>20%</fact7> of its then-current value (<fact12>$4410</fact12>). This is a loss of <fact12>$4410</fact12> * 0.<fact7>20</fact7> = <fact13>$882</fact13>.  Therefore, the final value of the boat is <fact12>$4410</fact12> - <fact13>$882</fact13> = <fact14>$3528</fact14>.


So, after <fact8>three years</fact8>, the boat is worth <fact14>$3528</fact14>.

How many pencils were left?","**Reformatted Question:** Each student in Marissa's class started the year with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>. After two months, <fact2>1/5 of the total pencils</fact2> in class were used. At the end of the year, only <fact3>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact3> were left. There are <fact4>30 students</fact4> in Marissa's class. <fact5>How many pencils were left</fact5>?


**Answer:**

1. **Total pencils at the start:** There were <fact4>30 students</fact4> and each started with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>, so there were 30 * 10 = 300 pencils in total.

2. **Pencils used after two months:** After two months, <fact2>1/5 of the total pencils</fact2> were used, which is (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

3. **Remaining pencils after two months:**  This means there were 300 - 60 = 240 pencils remaining.

4. **Pencils left at the end of the year:** At the end of the year, <fact3>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact3> were left, meaning (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, <fact5>80 pencils were left</fact5>.

Kim sleepwalks. To monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from <fact1>2:15 to 2:38 am</fact1>.  Also, that day she <fact2>woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual</fact2> to go to the bathroom. She <fact3>usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.</fact3> How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?


**Answer:**

Kim's usual sleep time is from <fact3>10 p.m. to 6 a.m.</fact3>, which is 8 hours or 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

She woke up <fact2>5 minutes earlier than usual</fact2>, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.  This means she slept in her bed from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.

From 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. is 4 hours, or 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.  From 2 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 15 minutes. So, from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m., she was in bed for 240 + 15 = 255 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from <fact1>2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.</fact1>, a duration of 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.

From 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., she was in bed for 3 hours and 17 minutes.  This is (3 * 60) + 17 = 180 + 17 = 197 minutes.

So, the total time she spent in bed asleep that day is 255 (time in bed until sleepwalking began) + 197 (time in bed after sleepwalking ended) = 452 minutes.


Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.
