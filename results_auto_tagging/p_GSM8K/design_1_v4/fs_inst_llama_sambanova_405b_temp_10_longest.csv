Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk rise by <fact1>$50 each time</fact1> and <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2>. She accepts the opening bid of <fact3>$200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer: 
Carmen starts with the opening bid of <fact3>$200</fact3>. Since <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2> and Carmen bids after each of them, she will bid a total of 4 times (including the initial bid). Each time the bid increases by <fact1>$50</fact1>. So, the total increase in the bid will be <fact1>$50</fact1> * 3 = $150. Therefore, the final cost of the desk will be <fact3>$200</fact3> + $150 = $350. The answer is {350}."

For the <fact2>third year he buys 4 games a month</fact2> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas every year</fact3>.  He saves up enough money to buy <fact4>1 game per month for a year</fact4>, and then the <fact5>second year he starts buying 2 games a month</fact5>.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?

Answer: 
Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1>. For the first year, he buys <fact4>1 game per month</fact4> * 12 months = 12 games and gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>, for a total of 12 + 5 = 17 games. For the <fact5>second year, he buys 2 games a month</fact5> * 12 months = 24 games and gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. For the <fact2>third year, he buys 4 games a month</fact2> * 12 months = 48 games and gets <fact3>5 games for Christmas</fact3>, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. So, after 3 years, Steve has <fact1>5</fact1> + 17 + 29 + 53 = 104 games. The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question: 
Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact2>a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but only about <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer: 
To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply it by the total number of potatoes. It takes Billy <fact2>a minute and a half (or 90 seconds) to peel a potato</fact2> and <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. Since Billy has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through, the total time it will take him to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 seconds * <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> = 5700 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes. The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: 
James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>.  He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>.  Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>.  He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>.  How much money was he out?

Answer: 
James bought <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1> at a cost of <fact4>$15</fact4> each. However, he got them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>, so he paid only 60% of the original price. The cost of each CD would be <fact4>$15</fact4> * 0.6 = $9. The total cost of the CDs would be <fact1>10</fact1> * $9 = $90. James then sold <fact2>5 of them</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>, so he recovered some of the cost. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he recovered from the total cost: $90 - <fact3>$40</fact3> = $50. The answer is {50}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1>. <fact2>One-fourth of the seats</fact2> were occupied by the administrators. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats</fact3> were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since there are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1> and the school auditorium has <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>, the total number of seats is <fact1>18</fact1> * <fact4>4</fact4> = 72 seats. <fact2>One-fourth of the seats</fact2> were occupied by the administrators, which is 72 * 1/4 = 18 seats. The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats</fact3> were occupied by the parents, which is 54 * 1/3 = 18 seats. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is 54 - 18 = 36 seats. The answer is {36}."
5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>bag of glass chips holds 72 chips</fact1>. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>. It takes <fact3>twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic</fact3>. If he has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer: Milo has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, and each <fact1>bag of glass chips holds 72 chips</fact1>, so he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 chips. Since it takes <fact3>twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic</fact3>, he can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches of mosaic. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>, the length of the mosaic will be the total area (12 square inches) divided by the height (3 inches). So, the length of the mosaic will be 12 / 3 = 4 inches. The answer is {4}."
6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Reformatted Question: 
Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The first needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>. On average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>. The third needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. How many miles does the last dog need?

Answer: 
Since there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> and we know the walking distances for 3 of them, we can calculate the total walking distance for those 3 dogs. The first dog walks <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second dog walks <fact4>4 miles</fact4>, and the third dog walks <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. So the total distance walked by the first 3 dogs is <fact2>1</fact2> + <fact4>4</fact4> + <fact5>3</fact5> = 8 miles. Since on average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3> and there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>, the total distance they need to walk is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact3>3</fact3> = 12 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles. The answer is {4}."

Answer: 
If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will save the <fact1>$450 worth of damage</fact1> to his car. However, he will have to spend <fact2>3 buckets * $25 per bucket</fact2> = $75 on asphalt and pay a fine of <fact3>$120</fact3>. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $75 + $120 = $195.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","Reformatted Question: 
Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>.  His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> to remove the old carpet, and <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer: 
To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of removing the old carpet, installing the new carpet, and the cost of the new carpet itself. 

First, we need to find the area of the bedroom, which is <fact1>18 feet</fact1> * <fact1>12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet. 

The cost of removing the old carpet is <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> * 216 square feet = $864. 

The cost of installing the new carpet is <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> * 216 square feet = $7344. 

The cost of the new carpet itself is <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> * 216 square feet = $2592. 

The cost of the padding underneath the new carpet is <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5> * 216 square feet = $432. 

Therefore, the total cost of replacing the carpet is $864 + $7344 + $2592 + $432 = $11232. 

The answer is {11232}."

While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a <fact6>combined total of 500 apples</fact6>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer: 
Joanne gathered <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1> and <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, which is <fact1>30</fact1> / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4>, which is 2 * <fact1>30</fact1> = 60 apples, and <fact5>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5>, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. So, the total number of apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is <fact1>30</fact1> + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 apples.

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Reformatted Question: Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>.  Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>.  Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: First, we need to convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> / 12 = 1 foot wide. To find the total space required for each plant, we add the width of the plant to the space between plants: 1 foot + <fact4>1.5 feet</fact4> = 2.5 feet. Now, we can divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant to find the total number of plants that can fit: <fact1>111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 plants. Each plant costs <fact5>$6</fact5>, so Pat will spend 27 * <fact5>$6</fact5> = $162. The answer is {162}."

John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>. He spent <fact2>30% of the time with the following events</fact2>. He spends <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and half that time swimming.  He also watched <fact4>3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact4>.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: 
First, we need to find the total time John spent on the other activities. He spent <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and half that time swimming, which is 6/2 = 3 hours. He also watched <fact4>3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact4>, which is 3 x 2 = 6 hours. So, the total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. 

Since John spent <fact2>30% of the time with the following events</fact2>, we can assume that the 15 hours is 30% of the total time. Let's call the total time x. Then, 30% of x is 15 hours. We can set up the equation: 0.3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15/0.3 = 50 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time John spent sightseeing. He spent <fact1>40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>, which is 40% of 50 hours. So, the time spent sightseeing is 0.4 x 50 = 20 hours. The answer is {20}."

Answer: 
Kim has <fact1>3 clients</fact1> and is including <fact2>5 potential clients</fact2> in his calculations, so he has a total of <fact1>3</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 8 clients.

If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer: 
The teacher starts with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1> and uses <fact4>45% of the chalk</fact4> on the first day. So, he has 5 - 5 * 0.45 = 2.75 inches of chalk left. The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>. So, he can use 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk before recycling it. The teacher will use <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, which is 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk per day. However, he only has 0.75 inches of chalk left to use. So, he can use the chalk for 0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days, but this is not the correct answer since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day. To find the number of days, we need to divide 0.75 inches by the amount of chalk used per day. The teacher uses 5 * 0.2 = 1 inch of chalk per day. So, the teacher has 0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days, but we should divide 0.75 by 1 to get the decimal and then round down since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, which is 0.75, so it is less than a day but we should provide the answer in integer so we should use the chalk in less than 1 day, it will be used in 1 day but since 0.75 is less than 1 so the answer should be less than 1 but since we should give the answer in integer so the answer will be the less integer which is closest to the 0.75 which is 1 but it should be less than 1 so the closest less integer to 0.75 is 0 but since we can't give 0 as an answer so we should give the answer 1 but with explanation that it will be used in less than 1 day but since we should give the answer in integer so we should give the answer 1 but we should say that this is the maximum days and it will be used in less than this day."

Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the <fact3>40-yard line</fact3> and back. She does this <fact4>34 times</fact4>. Blake runs back and forth <fact5>15 times</fact5>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Answer: 
Kelly runs back and forth once, which is <fact2>100 yards</fact2> * 2 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the <fact3>40-yard line</fact3> and back <fact4>34 times</fact4>, which is <fact3>40 yards</fact3> * 2 * <fact4>34</fact4> = 2720 yards. So Kelly runs a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards. Blake runs back and forth <fact5>15 times</fact5>, which is <fact2>100 yards</fact2> * 2 * <fact5>15</fact5> = 3000 yards. Since Blake runs more yards than Kelly, Blake is the winner. The difference between the winner and the loser is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards. The answer is {80}."

Answer: 
Jenny's husband eats a total of <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2> = 7 cookies. Her son eats a total of <fact4>4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week</fact4> = 20 cookies. So together, they eat 7 + 20 = 27 cookies. Since the bag has <fact3>36 cookies</fact3>, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. The answer is {9}."
19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted Question: 
A <fact1>gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</fact1> and <fact2>cost $12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: 
To find the cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area covered by one gallon of paint to find the number of gallons needed. Then we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost. 

The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>, so their total area is 2 x <fact3>10 x 8</fact3> = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>, so their total area is 2 x <fact4>5 x 8</fact4> = 80 square feet. The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since <fact1>a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</fact1>, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint. 

Since <fact2>each gallon costs $12</fact2>, the total cost will be 12 x <fact2>$12</fact2> = $144.

The answer is {144}."

In the afternoon <fact5>twice as many people</fact5> checked in as those who opted for a <fact6>late checkout</fact6>.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?

Answer: 
The hotel started with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. After <fact2>24 guests</fact2> checked out early, there were 100 - 24 = 76 guests. Then, in the afternoon, <fact5>twice as many people</fact5> checked in as those who opted for a <fact6>late checkout</fact6>, which is 2 * <fact3>15 guests</fact3> = 30 guests.

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Reformatted Question: 
Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact1>30 lbs</fact1>. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn <fact2>3500 calories to lose a pound</fact2>, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

Answer: 
To calculate the calorie deficit needed per day, we first need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal. Since Andy wants to lose <fact1>30 lbs</fact1> and it takes <fact2>3500 calories to lose a pound</fact2>, he needs to burn a total of <fact1>30</fact1> * <fact2>3500</fact2> = 105000 calories. 

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. From December 31st to July 19th, there are 201 days (December has 31 days, January, March, May, and July have 31 days, February has 28 days, and April and June have 30 days, so the total number of days is 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 19 = 201). 

Now, we can calculate the calorie deficit needed per day by dividing the total number of calories by the number of days: 105000 / 201 = approximately 522 calories. 

The answer is {522}."

Answer: 
In the first 30 seconds, <fact4>20 kernels popped</fact4>. In the next 30 seconds, <fact5>three times that amount</fact5> popped, which is 20 * 3 = 60 kernels.

Carl used <fact1>2 slices of cheese per sandwich</fact1> for 7 days, so he used <fact1>2 slices of cheese per sandwich</fact1> * 7 days = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches. He used <fact2>8 slices of cheese</fact2> for macaroni and cheese. For omelets, he used <fact1>2 slices of cheese per sandwich</fact1> + <fact4>1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich</fact4> = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. He ate omelets for <fact3>3 days</fact3>, so he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet * <fact3>3 days</fact3> = 9 slices of cheese for omelets. In total, Carl used 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches + <fact2>8 slices of cheese</fact2> for macaroni and cheese + 9 slices of cheese for omelets = 31 slices of cheese. The answer is {31}."

Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the <fact1>second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact1>. On the <fact2>first race, he lost $5</fact2>. On the <fact3>third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact3>. How much did he lose on average that day?

Answer: 
Johnny's dad lost <fact2>$5</fact2> on the first race. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2 * <fact2>$5</fact2> + $1 = $11. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. To find the average loss, we need to find the total loss and divide it by the number of races. The total loss is <fact2>$5</fact2> (lost on the first race) + $0 (won on the second race, so no loss) + $16.50 (lost on the third race) = $21.50. However, since he won $11 on the second race, the net loss is $21.50 - $11 = $10.50. The average loss is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50. The answer is {3.50}."

James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys <fact1>10 suits</fact1> and <fact2>10 dress pants</fact2>.  The <fact3>suits cost $750 each</fact3> and the <fact4>dress pants cost 1/5 that cost</fact4>.  He also buys <fact5>3 dress shirts per suit</fact5>.  The <fact6>dress shirts were $60 each</fact6>.  How much did everything cost?

Answer: 
To find the total cost of everything, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts. The suits cost <fact3>$750 each</fact3>, and James bought <fact1>10 suits</fact1>, so the total cost of the suits is <fact3>$750</fact3> * <fact1>10</fact1> = $7500. The dress pants cost <fact4>1/5 the cost of a suit</fact4>, which is <fact3>$750</fact3> / 5 = $150. James bought <fact2>10 dress pants</fact2>, so the total cost of the dress pants is $150 * <fact2>10</fact2> = $1500. James also bought <fact5>3 dress shirts per suit</fact5>, and he bought <fact1>10 suits</fact1>, so he bought a total of <fact5>3</fact5> * <fact1>10</fact1> = 30 dress shirts. The <fact6>dress shirts cost $60 each</fact6>, so the total cost of the dress shirts is <fact6>$60</fact6> * 30 = $1800. Therefore, the total cost of everything is $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800. The answer is {10800}."

Answer: 
Jack can play for <fact3>20 minutes</fact3> per <fact2>quarter</fact2>. Two of his friends can play for <fact3>20 minutes</fact3> * <fact4>0.5</fact4> = 10 minutes per <fact2>quarter</fact2>.

How much does replacing the movies cost if <fact6>a normal movie costs $10</fact6>?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many movies are in series and how many are not. Since <fact4>a third of the movies are in various series</fact4>, the number of movies in series is <fact1>600 movies</fact1> * 1/3 = 200 movies. The number of movies not in series is <fact1>600 movies</fact1> - 200 movies = 400 movies. 

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. Since <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies</fact2>, the number of older movies is 400 movies * 0.4 = 160 movies. 

The cost of replacing the older movies is 160 movies * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $800. 

The cost of replacing the movies in series is 200 movies * (<fact6>$10</fact6> - <fact5>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact5> * <fact6>$10</fact6> / <fact6>$10</fact6>) = 200 movies * $4 = $800.

The cost of replacing the remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies is (400 movies - 160 movies) * <fact6>$10</fact6> = 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Therefore, the total cost of replacing the movies is $800 + $800 + $2400 = $4000."

Out of the <fact4>remaining class</fact4>, <fact5>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact5>.  How many students are leaving early?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since <fact3>20% of the class are football players</fact3> and there are <fact2>30 students</fact2> in total, the number of football players is <fact3>20%</fact3> * <fact2>30</fact2> = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students. 

Now, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4>. Since there are <fact2>30 students</fact2> in total and 6 of them are football players, the number of students in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4> is <fact2>30</fact2> - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of band. Since <fact5>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact5> in the <fact4>remaining class</fact4>, the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of band is <fact5>25%</fact5> * 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. Since the students who are leaving early are <fact1>football players, cheerleaders or part of band</fact1>, the number of students leaving early is 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or part of band) = 12 students.

Answer: 
On the first day, Wanda filled <fact2>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact2>, which is <fact6>18000 gallons</fact6> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact3>3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped</fact3>, which is 4500 * <fact3>3/4</fact3> = 3375 gallons.

Answer: 
George needs to pay for <fact1>2 implants</fact1>, each with a <fact2>base price of $2000</fact2>, so the total cost for the implants is <fact1>2 implants</fact1> * <fact2>$2000 per implant</fact2> = $4000.

But, the third week, Boris produces <fact3>three times as much as the first week</fact3>. Boris produces <fact4>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact4>. How much does he produce the fourth week?

Answer: 
To find out how much Boris produces the fourth week, we first need to calculate how much he produced in the first three weeks. In the first week, Boris produced <fact4>8,000 bars of chocolate</fact4>. In the second week, he produced <fact2>half as much as the first week</fact2>, which is <fact4>8,000</fact4> / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate. In the third week, he produced <fact3>three times as much as the first week</fact3>, which is <fact4>8,000</fact4> * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate. So, in total, Boris produced 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate in the first three weeks. Since Boris produces <fact1>50,000 bars of chocolate each month</fact1>, he must produce 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The answer is {14,000}."

Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used <fact4>three of the spoons</fact4> to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as x. We know that Julia's husband bought <fact2>5 new spoons</fact2> and gave them to Julia. We also know that Julia used <fact4>three of the spoons</fact4> to sample her stew. When she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact3>12 spoons</fact3>. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially (x) plus the number of spoons her husband gave her (<fact2>5</fact2>), minus the number of spoons she used to sample the stew (<fact4>3</fact4>), is equal to the total number of spoons she had when she set the table (<fact3>12</fact3>).

What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer: 
Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x. Since the power bank was losing <fact2>9% of the total capacity each hour</fact2> for <fact4>5 hours</fact4>, it lost a total of 5 * 9% = 45% of its capacity during this time. After that, it lost <fact5>7% of the total capacity each hour</fact5> for <fact6>3 hours</fact6>, which is an additional 3 * 7% = 21% of its capacity. So, in total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its capacity. Since the charge remaining was <fact3>28%</fact3>, we can set up the equation: x - 66% * x = 28% * x.

If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?","Reformatted Question: A charity group decides to do a yard sale.  <fact1>10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each</fact1>.  They can fit <fact2>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact2>.  They also have <fact3>10 boxes of stuff already</fact3>.  If they already own <fact4>15 tables</fact4>, how many new tables do they need?

Answer: The charity group has <fact1>10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each</fact1>, so they have <fact1>10 people</fact1> * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes of stuff donated. They also have <fact3>10 boxes of stuff already</fact3>, so they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff. Since they can fit <fact2>2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact2>, they need 60 boxes / <fact2>2 boxes per table</fact2> = 30 tables. They already own <fact4>15 tables</fact4>, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables. The answer is {15}."
53,"Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. How many did each person get?","Reformatted Question: 
Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>, which was <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>. Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>. How many did each person get?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Since Carlos collected <fact3>twice as many as Carrey</fact3>, Carlos collected 2x seashells. Jim collected <fact2>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact2>, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells. We are given that Jim collected <fact1>27 seashells</fact1>, so we can set up the equation 2x + 5 = 27. Solving for x, we get x = 11. Therefore, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2x = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 2x + 5 = 27 seashells. However, the question asks how many seashells each person got after they divided them equally between themselves. To find the total number of seashells, we add 11 + 22 + 27 = 60. Dividing this total by 3, we get 60/3 = 20. Therefore, each person got 20 seashells."

Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?","Reformatted Question: 
Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees <fact1>30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours</fact1>, and then she sees <fact2>1/2 that many bees return</fact2> in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. She sees <fact3>two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive</fact3> fly from the hive and leave in the third 6 hours.

Answer: 
Debra initially saw <fact1>30 bees leave the hive</fact1>. Then, she saw <fact2>1/2 that many bees return</fact2>, which is 30/<fact2>2</fact2> = 15 bees return. In the last 6 hours, she saw <fact3>two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive</fact3> fly from the hive, which is <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>30 bees</fact1> = 60 bees leave. Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is the number of bees that left initially minus the number of bees that returned in the next 6 hours, which is <fact1>30 bees</fact1> - 15 bees = 15 bees, plus the number of bees that left in the last 6 hours, which is 60 bees. Therefore, Debra saw 15 + 60 = 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours. The answer is {75}."

Answer: 
Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house will be the selling price minus the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount. The transfer fees are <fact1>3% of the selling price</fact1>, which is <fact1>3%</fact1> * <fact3>$400 000</fact3> = $12 000. The brokerage fee is <fact2>5% of the selling price</fact2>, which is <fact2>5%</fact2> * <fact3>$400 000</fact3> = $20 000. So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house will be <fact3>$400 000</fact3> - $12 000 - $20 000 - <fact4>$250 000</fact4> = $118 000. The answer is {118000}."

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Answer: Since <fact1>Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</fact1>, Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * <fact3>20 seconds</fact3> = 40 seconds. Since <fact2>Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact2>, Igneous' howl lasts for <fact3>20 seconds</fact3> + 40 seconds = 60 seconds. The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is <fact3>20 seconds</fact3> + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes.

Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1> to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of <fact2>$25</fact2>. There is a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3> at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for <fact4>$35</fact4>. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs <fact2>$25</fact2>, and there is a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3>. So the discount is <fact2>$25</fact2> * <fact3>30%</fact3> = <fact2>$25</fact2> * 0.3 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is <fact2>$25</fact2> - $7.50 = $17.50. The total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + <fact4>$35</fact4> = $52.50. Since Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1>, he will not have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $52.50 - <fact1>$50</fact1> = $2.50. The answer is -2.50"

Answer: 
On Tuesday, Clara bought <fact2>20 pomegranates at $20 each</fact2>, so she paid 20 * $20 = $400.

The next day, Sheila bought <fact5>20 pomegranates</fact5> at <fact3>$30 per fruit</fact3>, so she paid 20 * $30 = $600. However, she also got a <fact4>10% discount on the total cost</fact4>, so she paid $600 - 0.1 * $600 = $600 - $60 = $540.

How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. The number of toys Sophie already had is the sum of the number of rings, blocks, and stuffed animals. So, the number of toys Sophie already had is <fact1>9 multicolored rings</fact1> + <fact2>31 blocks</fact2> + <fact3>8 stuffed animals</fact3> = 48 toys. Since Sophie now has a total of <fact4>62</fact4> toys, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is <fact4>62</fact4> - 48 = 14. The answer is {14}."

Answer: 
To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham. The eggs contribute <fact1>75 calories each</fact1> * <fact4>6 eggs</fact4> = 450 calories. The cheese contributes <fact2>120 calories per ounce</fact2> * <fact5>2 oz</fact5> = 240 calories. Since there is an equal amount of ham, the ham also contributes <fact3>40 calories per ounce</fact3> * <fact5>2 oz</fact5> = 80 calories. Therefore, the total calories in the omelet are 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories. The answer is {770}."

Answer: 
Sheila initially charged <fact1>$85.00 worth of merchandise</fact1> on her credit card. After returning an item that cost <fact4>$15.00</fact4>, her balance became <fact1>$85.00</fact1> - <fact4>$15.00</fact4> = $70.00. Then, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for <fact2>20% off $20.00</fact2>, which means she paid $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan. She also bought a set of towels that was <fact3>10% off $30.00</fact3>, which means she paid $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the towels.

If they are there for <fact4>3 days</fact4> how much did the trip cost?

Answer: To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the hotel and the cost of the plane tickets. The hotel is <fact1>20% more expensive than normal</fact1>, so the cost per day is <fact2>$1500</fact2> + (<fact2>$1500</fact2> * <fact1>20%</fact1>) = $1500 + $300 = $1800. Since they are staying for <fact4>3 days</fact4>, the total cost of the hotel is $1800 * <fact4>3</fact4> = $5400. The <fact3>plane tickets cost $5000 each</fact3>, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

He edits an <fact4>equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers</fact4>, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Answer: 
Since Mark edits an <fact4>equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers</fact4>, he edits <fact1>1000 sentences each week</fact1> / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. For <fact2>Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence</fact2>, so he earns 500 * <fact2>5 cents</fact2> = 2500 cents from Publisher A. Since <fact3>Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays</fact3>, Publisher B pays 2 * <fact2>5 cents</fact2> = 10 cents per sentence.

The Go-karts cost <fact4>$10 a ride</fact4>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Morgan has a budget of <fact1>$90</fact1> for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf with her friends, which costs <fact2>$5</fact2> per person. She also wants to give each friend <fact3>$5 in arcade tokens</fact3>. Additionally, she wants to ride the go-karts twice with each friend, which costs <fact4>$10</fact4> per ride, so <fact4>$10</fact4> * 2 = $20 per person for the go-karts. The total cost per person is <fact2>$5</fact2> + <fact3>$5</fact3> + $20 = $30. Since Morgan also wants to participate in these activities, she needs to include her own cost in the total. Her total cost will be $30 (her cost) + $30x (her friends' cost) = <fact1>$90</fact1>.

Answer: 
To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact2>5% of the selling price</fact2>, which is <fact2>5%</fact2> * <fact1>$350,000</fact1> = $17,500.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee: <fact1>$350,000</fact1> + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500. To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - <fact4>$400,000</fact4> = $9,500. The answer is {9500}."

Betty collected <fact4>30% more</fact4> than Adam, so she has 50 + 50 * 0.3 = 65 points. Tom has <fact3>30 points less than Betty</fact3>, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points. Marta collected <fact2>3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points. The total points collected by all students is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points. Since the <fact5>minimum threshold is 400 points</fact5>, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points. The answer is {145}."
71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Reformatted Question: 
Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out <fact1>17 fish</fact1> out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <fact2>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact2>. Bob started with <fact3>7 fish</fact3> in his pond. <fact4>3 were orange</fact4>, and <fact5>4 were white</fact5>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the store as x and the number of orange fish as y. We know that x + y = <fact1>17 fish</fact1> because that's the total number of fish he bought. We also know that after adding these fish to his pond, he had <fact2>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact2>. Initially, Bob had <fact5>4 white fish</fact5> and <fact4>3 orange fish</fact4> in his pond. So, after adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is x + <fact5>4</fact5> and the total number of orange fish is y + <fact4>3</fact4>. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation: y + <fact4>3</fact4> = 2(x + <fact5>4</fact5>). We can simplify this equation to y + 3 = 2x + 8, and then y = 2x + 5. Now we can substitute y = 2x + 5 into the first equation x + y = <fact1>17</fact1> to get x + 2x + 5 = 17. Solving for x, we get 3x = 12, so x = 4. Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. The answer is {4}."
72,"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?","Reformatted Question:

Answer: 
Two years ago, Leo had <fact1>100 stickers in his collection</fact1>. Last year, he collected <fact3>50 stickers</fact3>, so at the end of last year, he had <fact1>100 stickers</fact1> + <fact3>50 stickers</fact3> = 150 stickers. This year, he collected <fact2>twice the number of stickers as the previous year</fact2>, so he collected 2 * <fact3>50 stickers</fact3> = 100 stickers. Therefore, Leo now has 150 stickers + 100 stickers = 250 stickers in his collection. The answer is {250}."

A toy manufacturer receives an order for <fact1>400 toys</fact1>. <fact2>5 workers</fact2> are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another <fact4>20 toys</fact4> to be able to ship the order. <fact5>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, and another <fact6>2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer: 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is (<fact5>2 workers * 6 toys/hour</fact5>) + (<fact6>2 workers * 4 toys/hour</fact6>) = 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. Since they work for <fact3>10 hours</fact3>, they produce a total of 20 toys/hour * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 200 toys. The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is <fact1>400 toys</fact1> - <fact4>20 toys</fact4> = 380 toys. So, the fifth worker produces 380 - 200 = 180 toys in <fact3>10 hours</fact3>. Therefore, the fifth worker produces 180 toys / <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 18 toys per hour. The answer is {18}."

After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

Answer: 
To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total cost after adding the tip, delivery vendor fee, and delivery fees. First, we add the tip to the final bill: <fact1>$40.00</fact1> + <fact2>$4.00</fact2> = $44.00. Then, we calculate the delivery vendor fee: <fact3>25% fee</fact3> of $44.00 is 0.25 * $44.00 = $11.00. Now, we add the delivery vendor fee and delivery fees to the total cost: $44.00 + $11.00 + <fact4>$3.00</fact4> = $58.00. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.00."

Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is <fact1>.15 cubic inches</fact1>. He also knows that they get about <fact2>80% efficiency in packing</fact2>. He estimates <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>. The jar has a square base and is <fact4>6 inches by 6 inches</fact4> and <fact5>15 inches tall</fact5>.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact6>900</fact6>.  How far off was his guess?

Answer: 
To find the volume of the jar, we multiply the area of the base by the height. The area of the base is <fact4>6 inches</fact4> * <fact4>6 inches</fact4> = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height, we get 36 * <fact5>15 inches</fact5> = 540 cubic inches. Since a jelly bean is <fact1>.15 cubic inches</fact1>, we can fit 540 / <fact1>.15</fact1> = 3600 jelly beans in the jar if it were packed perfectly. However, since they only get <fact2>80% efficiency in packing</fact2>, we can fit 3600 * <fact2>.8</fact2> = 2880 jelly beans in the jar. Since <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>, there are 2880 * <fact3>.3</fact3> = 864 red jelly beans in the jar. The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact6>900</fact6>, so Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36. The answer is {36}."

Answer: 
To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time it took John to drive to his friend's house and the time it took him to drive back home. The distance to his friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5> + <fact2>10 miles</fact2> = 210 miles. The time it took him to drive to his friend's house is 210 miles / <fact1>70 mph</fact1> = 3 hours.

If he <fact4>saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4> and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Answer: 
First, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the <fact2>jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans</fact2>, and the <fact1>tattered jeans cost $28</fact1>, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. However, this is the sale price. To find the original price, we need to find the amount saved on the jogger jeans. Since Cole <fact3>saved a total of $6</fact3> and <fact4>saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4>, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 on the jogger jeans. So the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24. Now we can compare the original prices. The <fact1>tattered jeans cost $28</fact1> originally, and the jogger jeans cost $24 originally. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $24 = $4 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is {-4}."

Answer: 
The air conditioner cools the room <fact4>2 degrees an hour on low</fact4> and it ran on low for <fact1>3 hours</fact1>, so it cooled the room <fact4>2 degrees/hour</fact4> * <fact1>3 hours</fact1> = 6 degrees.

So, after running on low and high, the room was cooled 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. Afterward, it was turned off for <fact3>2 hours</fact3> and the room will warm up at <fact6>2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running</fact6>, so the room warmed up <fact6>2 degrees/hour</fact6> * <fact3>2 hours</fact3> = 4 degrees.

On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a <fact3>1-hour episode</fact3> and a <fact4>30-minute show</fact4>. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two <fact5>1-hour episodes</fact5>. If he watched <fact6>7 hours of TV</fact6> in all, how many <fact1>30-minute episodes</fact1> did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: Frankie watched a total of <fact6>7 hours of TV</fact6>, which is equivalent to 7 * 60 = 420 minutes. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a total of 2 * <fact2>1-hour episodes</fact2> = 2 hours = 120 minutes. On Thursday, he watched a <fact3>1-hour episode</fact3> and a <fact4>30-minute show</fact4>, which is a total of 90 minutes. On Friday, he watched two <fact5>1-hour episodes</fact5>, which is a total of 120 minutes. So, the total time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 120 + 90 + 120 = 330 minutes. This means that on Wednesday, Frankie watched 420 - 330 = 90 minutes of TV. Since each episode is <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> long, Frankie watched 90 / 30 = 3 episodes on Wednesday. The answer is {3}."

She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: 
Martha has <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> and she wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. To make a hat, she needs <fact2>2 skeins of wool</fact2>, so for 3 hats, she needs <fact2>2 skeins</fact2> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins. To make a scarf, she needs <fact3>4 skeins of wool</fact3>, so for 3 scarves, she needs <fact3>4 skeins</fact3> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 12 skeins. To make a sweater, she needs <fact4>12 skeins of wool</fact4>, so for 3 sweaters, she needs <fact4>12 skeins</fact4> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 36 skeins. To make a pair of mittens, she needs <fact5>1 skein of wool</fact5>, so for 3 pairs of mittens, she needs <fact5>1 skein</fact5> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 3 skeins. To make a pair of socks, she needs <fact6>2 skeins of wool</fact6>, so for 3 pairs of socks, she needs <fact6>2 skeins</fact6> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins.

Each <fact4>student earns the same amount</fact4>.  How much did each student raise?

Answer: To find out how much each student raised, we first need to find out how much money the students raised in total. We know that the charity raised a total of <fact1>$175,000</fact1> and that <fact2>$50,000 came from organizations</fact2>. So, the amount raised by the students is <fact1>$175,000</fact1> - <fact2>$50,000</fact2> = $125,000. Since there are 20 students and <fact4>each student earns the same amount</fact4>, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. Therefore, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250."

If it takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?

Answer: 
Since Bernadette wants to arrive <fact1>5 minutes before Wayne</fact1>, we need to calculate how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then subtract Wayne's time from it, and add the <fact1>5 minutes</fact1> difference. It takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes <fact2>four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel</fact2>, it will take Bernadette <fact2>four times</fact2> * <fact3>four minutes</fact3> = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Answer: 
On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>20 White Oak trees</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees</fact4>, which is 2 * <fact3>20</fact3> = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4> and he also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>.  How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer: 
John goes to work <fact1>5 days a week</fact1> for <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2>, so he goes to work a total of <fact1>5 days/week</fact1> * <fact2>50 weeks/year</fact2> = 250 days/year. Since he has to go to work and back, the total distance driven per day is <fact3>30 miles</fact3> * 2 = 60 miles. So, the total distance driven per year is 60 miles/day * 250 days/year = 15000 miles/year. He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4>, so the total cost per year for driving is 15000 miles/year * <fact4>$2/mile</fact4> = $30000/year. Additionally, he gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>, so the total bonus per year is <fact5>$150/month</fact5> * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. According to the problem, Henry wanted to make <fact4>twice as many cookies as he did last year</fact4>, so he wanted to make 2x cookies this year. However, he actually baked <fact1>15 more cookies than he meant to</fact1>, so he baked 2x + <fact1>15</fact1> cookies. After dropping <fact2>5 cookies</fact2>, he had 2x + <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> cookies left, which is equal to <fact3>110 cookies</fact3>. We can set up the equation 2x + <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact3>110</fact3> and solve for x.

Finally, <fact3>one person actually came by on a unicycle</fact3>. <fact4>Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</fact4>. How many dollars did she make that day?

Answer: 
To calculate how much money Shawnda made, we need to determine how many tires she inflated. Since bicycles have 2 tires, she inflated <fact1>5 people on bicycles</fact1> * 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires for bicycles. Since tricycles have 3 tires, she inflated <fact2>3 people on tricycles</fact2> * 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires for tricycles. Since unicycles have 1 tire, she inflated <fact3>1 person on a unicycle</fact3> * 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire for unicycles. In total, she inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Since <fact4>each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</fact4>, she made 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, she made 500 cents / 100 cents per dollar = $5. The answer is {5}."

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Reformatted Question: Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals. She feeds each of the chickens <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1>, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens <fact2>15 cups of feed</fact2>.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another <fact3>25 cups of feed</fact3>.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is <fact4>20 chickens</fact4>?

Answer: Since Wendi has <fact4>20 chickens</fact4> and each chicken needs <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1> per day, the total amount of feed needed per day is <fact4>20 chickens</fact4> * <fact1>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact1> = 60 cups.

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Reformatted Question: 
Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact1>. There's a <fact2>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</fact2>. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact3>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer: 
To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in. If the <fact1>normal teacher comes in and gives everyone an extension (40% chance)</fact1>, he won't have to turn it in. Additionally, if he has a <fact2>substitute teacher (50% chance)</fact2>, he also won't have to turn it in. However, if the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, Marcus still has a <fact3>20% chance of convincing the teacher for a personal extension</fact3>. 

First, let's find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in. The probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension is (1 - <fact2>0.5</fact2>) * (1 - <fact1>0.4</fact1>) = 0.3. Then, the probability that Marcus won't be able to convince the teacher for a personal extension is (1 - <fact3>0.2</fact3>) = 0.8. So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24.

Since there's a <fact2>50% chance of having a substitute teacher</fact2> and a 0% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework in that case, the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 0.24 * (1 - <fact2>0.5</fact2>) = 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.12 or 12% + 0% * <fact2>0.5</fact2> =  0.12 or 12%."
112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button.

How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted Question: 
Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each <fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>. A <fact2>small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. A <fact3>large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>. Lorraine starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact6>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact6> and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <fact7>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact7>. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: 
Lorraine starts with <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5> and trades <fact6>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact6>, so she gets 0.5 * <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5> = 20 large buttons. Since a <fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>, the rest of the large stickers are traded for small buttons, which is 0.5 * <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5> * 3 = 60 small buttons. Lorraine also starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and trades <fact7>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact7>, so she gets 0.9 * <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> / 3 = 9 large buttons, since a <fact3>large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>. The remaining 10% of the small stickers are traded for small buttons, which is 0.1 * <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> = 3 small buttons, since a <fact2>small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. In total, Lorraine has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons. The answer is {92}."
113,44 seniors need to receive awards.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"Reformatted Question: 
<fact1>44 seniors</fact1> need to receive awards.  <fact2>2 of the seniors</fact2> will also receive pins that are <fact3>$5</fact3>.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs <fact4>$20</fact4>.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact5>20% cost per frame</fact5>.  <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers and they will need to receive cords that are <fact7>$12 each</fact7>.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each senior receives a picture frame, we need <fact1>44</fact1> frames. Each frame costs <fact4>$20</fact4> and needs to be etched with the logo for an additional <fact5>20% cost per frame</fact5>. So, the total cost per frame is <fact4>$20</fact4> + <fact4>$20</fact4> * <fact5>20%</fact5> = $24. The total cost of the frames is <fact1>44</fact1> * $24 = $1056.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. Since <fact2>2 seniors</fact2> will receive pins, the total cost of the pins is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $10.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. Since <fact6>1/4 of the seniors</fact6> are officers, we need to calculate 1/4 of <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> to find the number of officers. 1/4 of <fact1>44</fact1> is 11. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * <fact7>$12</fact7> = $132.

Finally, we add up the costs of the frames, pins, and cords to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts. The total amount is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198. The answer is {1198}."

Answer: 
Mike can write <fact1>a page every 6 minutes</fact1>, so he can write 60 minutes per hour / <fact1>6 minutes per page</fact1> = 10 pages per hour. He was a pen pal with <fact2>5 people</fact2> but stopped being penpals with <fact3>2 of them</fact3>, so he is still penpals with <fact2>5</fact2> - <fact3>2</fact3> = 3 people. They each send <fact4>2 letters a week</fact4> that are <fact5>5 pages long</fact5>, so Mike responds with 3 people * <fact4>2 letters per week</fact4> * <fact5>5 pages per letter</fact5> = 30 pages per week. Since Mike can write 10 pages per hour, he spends 30 pages per week / 10 pages per hour = 3 hours per week writing. The answer is {3}."

Toby can read at a rate of <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3>. It takes <fact4>10 minutes to get to the airport</fact4>. He has to be at the airport in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?

Answer: To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we first need to calculate how long it will take him to finish the book. The book is <fact1>45 pages long</fact1> and averages <fact2>200 words a page</fact2>, so the total number of words in the book is <fact1>45 pages</fact1> * <fact2>200 words per page</fact2> = 9000 words. Since Toby can read at a rate of <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3>, it will take him 9000 words / <fact3>300 words per minute</fact3> = 30 minutes to finish the book. After finishing the book, it will take him <fact4>10 minutes to get to the airport</fact4>, so in total, he will need 30 minutes + <fact4>10 minutes</fact4> = 40 minutes. Since he has to be at the airport in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>, he will be <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early. The answer is {20}."

Mr. Marcellus realized <fact1>2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased</fact1> had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. A company had sold <fact2>4000 gallons of milk</fact2> in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of <fact3>$3.5 per gallon</fact3>. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.

Answer: 
To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. Since <fact1>2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased</fact1> had passed the expiry date, we can calculate the amount of sour milk as <fact2>4000 gallons of milk</fact2> * <fact1>2/5</fact1> = 1600 gallons. 

Now, we can calculate the refund amount by multiplying the amount of sour milk by the cost per gallon, which is <fact3>$3.5 per gallon</fact3>. Therefore, the refund amount is 1600 gallons * <fact3>$3.5 per gallon</fact3> = $5600. The answer is {5600}."

Answer: 
To calculate the profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making 10 jars and subtract it from the total revenue. The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is <fact5>2 pounds per jar</fact5> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact1>$6 per pound</fact1> = $120. The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is <fact6>1.5 pounds per jar</fact6> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact2>$8 per pound</fact2> = $120. The cost of honey for 10 jars is <fact7>2 pounds per jar</fact7> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact3>$10 per pound</fact3> = $200. The total cost is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

Answer: 
James pays <fact1>$5000 a month</fact1> to rent a hanger. Since there are 12 months in a year, he pays <fact1>$5000 a month</fact1> * 12 months = $60,000 per year for the hanger. He also spends <fact2>twice as much as that on fuel per month</fact2>, so he spends 2 * <fact1>$5000 a month</fact1> = $10,000 per month on fuel. For the entire year, he spends $10,000 per month * 12 months = $120,000 on fuel. The plane itself costs <fact3>$150,000</fact3>. Therefore, the total cost for the first year is $60,000 for the hanger + $120,000 for fuel + <fact3>$150,000</fact3> for the plane = $330,000. The answer is {330000}."

129,Tom plants 10 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?,"Reformatted Question: Tom plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1>. He starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2>. After <fact3>10 years</fact3>, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>. Every year he also chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5>. How many trees does he have left?

Answer: Tom starts with <fact2>50 trees</fact2> and plants <fact1>10 trees a year</fact1> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, so he has 50 + 10 * 10 = 150 trees. However, <fact4>30% of the trees die</fact4>, which is 0.3 * 150 = 45 trees. So, he has 150 - 45 = 105 trees left. Additionally, he chops down <fact5>2 trees a year</fact5> for <fact3>10 years</fact3>, which is 2 * 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he has 105 - 20 = 85 trees left. The answer is {85}."

Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1> and <fact2>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact2>. He has <fact3>55 goats in Farm X</fact3> and <fact4>45 goats in Farm Y</fact4>. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?

Answer: 
Mr. Smith originally had <fact3>55 goats in Farm X</fact3> and sold <fact1>10 goats from Farm X</fact1>, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X. He sold <fact2>twice as many goats from Farm Y</fact2> as from Farm X, so he sold 2 * <fact1>10 goats</fact1> = 20 goats from Farm Y. Since he originally had <fact4>45 goats in Farm Y</fact4>, he now has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y. Therefore, he has 45 + 25 = 70 goats left in the two farms altogether. The answer is {70}."

Answer: 
John can make logs out of <fact4>80% of the tree</fact4>, which is <fact4>80%</fact4> * <fact1>80 feet</fact1> = 64 feet. Since he cuts the tree into <fact2>4-foot logs</fact2>, he can make 64 feet / <fact2>4 feet per log</fact2> = 16 logs.

The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound. There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?,"Reformatted Question: 
Each muffaletta sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1> and would serve <fact2>4 people</fact2>.  Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. The <fact3>meat cost $7.00 per pound</fact3> and the <fact4>cheese cost $3.00 per pound</fact4>. There would be <fact5>20 people</fact5> in total watching the game.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>?

Answer: 
To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make to serve <fact5>20 people</fact5>. Since each sandwich serves <fact2>4 people</fact2>, he needs to make <fact5>20 people</fact5> / <fact2>4 people</fact2> per sandwich = 5 sandwiches. 

Since each sandwich requires <fact1>1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>, he needs 5 sandwiches * <fact1>1 pound</fact1> of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat and 5 sandwiches * <fact1>1 pound</fact1> of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

The total cost of the meat is 5 pounds of meat * <fact3>$7.00 per pound</fact3> of meat = $35. The total cost of the cheese is 5 pounds of cheese * <fact4>$3.00 per pound</fact4> of cheese = $15.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $35 + $15 = $50. The answer is {50}."

Answer: 
Since Cole hid <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> and 1 dozen is 12, then Cole hid 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <fact3>2 less than Stacy</fact3>, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. So, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden in the yard. The answer is {9}."
134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.

Each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>. Each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>.  Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>.

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need to put all his crayons into. Since Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> and he wants to separate them into groups of <fact4>8</fact4>, he will need 200/<fact4>8</fact4> = 25 boxes. 

Since each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1> and Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>, the total weight of the crayons is <fact3>200</fact3> * <fact1>1</fact1> = 200 ounces. 

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * <fact5>8 ounces</fact5> = 200 ounces.

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces. 

Since each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>, the total weight in pounds is 400/<fact2>16</fact2> = 25 pounds.

The answer is {25}."

He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost <fact4>20% more</fact4> since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for <fact5>$2</fact5>. How much did everything cost?

Answer: Roger needs <fact1>a week's worth of coffee</fact1>, which is 7 days, and he uses <fact2>1 pound of coffee per day</fact2>, so he needs 7 * <fact2>1 pound of coffee per day</fact2> = 7 pounds of coffee. The more expensive brand costs <fact4>20% more</fact4> than the normal brand, which costs <fact3>$5 per pound</fact3>. So, the more expensive brand costs <fact3>$5 per pound</fact3> + <fact3>$5 per pound</fact3> * <fact4>20% more</fact4> = $5 + $5 * 0.2 = $6 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42. Adding the cost of the donut, which is <fact5>$2</fact5>, the total cost is $42 + <fact5>$2</fact5> = $44.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

Answer: 
Since <fact5>twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5> and <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>, then 2 * <fact2>11</fact2> = 22 students need size small.

He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra <fact6>$3.00</fact6> which will add chips and a drink.   How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is <fact7>$6.50</fact7>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito. The base burrito costs <fact7>$6.50</fact7>. Adding extra meat costs <fact2>$2.00</fact2>, extra cheese costs <fact3>$1.00</fact3>, and avocado costs <fact4>$1.00</fact4>. The total cost of these extras is <fact2>$2.00</fact2> + <fact3>$1.00</fact3> + <fact4>$1.00</fact4> = $4.00. The two sauces cost <fact5>$0.25 each</fact5>, so the total cost of the sauces is 2 * <fact5>$0.25</fact5> = $0.50. The upgrade costs <fact6>$3.00</fact6>. The total cost of the burrito is <fact7>$6.50</fact7> + $4.00 + $0.50 + <fact6>$3.00</fact6> = $14.00.

Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the <fact1>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and the <fact2>same amount of salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar each time</fact3>. She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer: 
Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Since she uses the <fact1>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1>, the amount of fragrance is also x. Since she uses <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>, the amount of salt is 2x. Since she uses the <fact2>same amount of salt as sugar</fact2>, the amount of sugar is also 2x. Since she uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4>, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x. The total amount of the mixture is <fact3>10 ounces</fact3>, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. This simplifies to 10x = 10, so x = 1.

Answer: 
The bus started with <fact4>20 people</fact4>. At the first stop, <fact2>40 people entered the bus</fact2>, so there were 20 + 40 = 60 people. At the second stop, <fact3>3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station</fact3> entered the bus, which is 3/4 * <fact2>40 people</fact2> = 30 people.

How much will the party cost?

Answer: 
To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class girls, and family members. So, the total number of guests is <fact1>25 classmates</fact1> + <fact2>7 girls in her dance class</fact2> + <fact3>13 family members</fact3> = 45. Since <fact4>4 people said they could not come</fact4>, the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41. 

The fee to rent the theater is <fact5>$125 for a party of 20</fact5>, and there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. The cost for the additional guests is <fact6>$6 for each additional guest</fact6> * 21 = $126.

Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up <fact1>50%</fact1> in the last few months after she bought some lumber.

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer: 
The cost of the <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> was <fact2>10 boards</fact2> * <fact3>$10 per board</fact3> = $100. The cost of the <fact4>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> was <fact4>5 boards</fact4> * <fact5>$16 per board</fact5> = $80. So the total cost of the leftover lumber was $100 + $80 = $180. Since prices have gone up by <fact1>50%</fact1>, the new price of the <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> is <fact2>10 boards</fact2> * <fact3>$10 per board</fact3> * (1 + <fact1>50%</fact1>) = <fact2>10 boards</fact2> * <fact3>$10 per board</fact3> * 1.5 = $150. The new price of the <fact4>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> is <fact4>5 boards</fact4> * <fact5>$16 per board</fact5> * (1 + <fact1>50%</fact1>) = <fact4>5 boards</fact4> * <fact5>$16 per board</fact5> * 1.5 = $120. So the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is $150 + $120 = $270. Therefore, the profit from selling the leftover lumber is $270 - $180 = $90. The answer is {90}."

First, let's calculate how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know that <fact3>4 plants need half of a cup of water</fact3> and that there are <fact2>20 plants</fact2> in total. We also know that <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is <fact2>20</fact2> - <fact1>8</fact1> - <fact3>4</fact3> = 8 plants. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed. <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>, so that's 8 cups. <fact3>4 plants need half of a cup of water</fact3>, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups. The rest (8 plants) need <fact4>a quarter of a cup of water</fact4>, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups. 

In total, Crista needs 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants. The answer is {12}."

Caroline has 4 children. The <fact1>second child is two inches taller than the first child</fact1>. The <fact2>first child is 6 feet tall</fact2>. The <fact3>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact3>.  And the <fact4>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact4>.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?

Answer: 
To find the height of the fourth child, we need to first find the height of the first child in inches. Since the <fact2>first child is 6 feet tall</fact2>, and there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall. 

The <fact1>second child is two inches taller than the first child</fact1>, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The <fact3>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact3>, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The <fact4>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact4>, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The answer is {72}."

151,"Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?","Reformatted Question: 
Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. In one month, Marcel sold a total of <fact1>300 bikes</fact1> among the types listed. <fact2>Half of them were Trekking bikes</fact2>, and <fact3>15% were BMX bikes</fact3>. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The price of one MTB is <fact4>$500</fact4>, BMX is <fact5>half the price of an MTB</fact5>, and a Trekking bike is <fact6>$450</fact6>. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many bikes of each type Marcel sold. We know that <fact2>half of the bikes were Trekking bikes</fact2>, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is <fact1>300</fact1> / 2 = 150. We also know that <fact3>15% of the bikes were BMX bikes</fact3>, so the number of BMX bikes sold is <fact1>300</fact1> * 0.15 = 45. The rest of the bikes were MTB type, so the number of MTB bikes sold is <fact1>300</fact1> - 150 - 45 = 105. 

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Marcel earned from selling each type of bike. The price of one MTB is <fact4>$500</fact4>, so the total amount earned from selling MTB bikes is 105 * <fact4>$500</fact4> = $52,500. The price of one BMX is <fact5>half the price of an MTB</fact5>, which is <fact4>$500</fact4> / 2 = $250, so the total amount earned from selling BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of one Trekking bike is <fact6>$450</fact6>, so the total amount earned from selling Trekking bikes is 150 * <fact6>$450</fact6> = $67,500. 

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month by adding up the amounts earned from each type of bike: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250. The answer is {131250}."

Together they have <fact3>10 times less medals than have been given out for counting</fact3>. How many medals have been given out for counting?

Answer: 
Since Ali has won <fact2>22 medals for counting super fast</fact2> and Izzy has <fact1>5 less medals than Ali</fact1>, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

One <fact5>apple costs $0.5</fact5> and one <fact6>banana costs twice as much</fact6>. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?

Answer: 
Since one <fact6>banana costs twice as much as an apple</fact6> and one <fact5>apple costs $0.5</fact5>, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1. Since <fact4>oranges cost three times as much as bananas</fact4> and bananas cost $1, oranges cost 3 * $1 = $3. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate. One crate consists of <fact1>5 bananas</fact1> that cost $1 each, so the bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5. One crate also consists of <fact2>12 apples</fact2> that cost $0.5 each, so the apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6. One crate also consists of <fact3>7 oranges</fact3> that cost $3 each, so the oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21. Therefore, the total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32. The answer is {32}."

He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>?

Answer: 
A normal student has <fact1>6 periods in a day</fact1>, but John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods in a day. Since each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>, John spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class. Additionally, he spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, we need to first calculate the total weekly minutes spent in class, which is 1600 minutes. Then, we can calculate the extra learning time: 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes, and since this is spent on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply by 2 to get 200 minutes. So, the total weekly minutes spent learning is 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1800 / 60 = 30 hours. The answer is {30}."

Answer: To calculate the required score, we first need to remove the <fact1>lowest score from the average</fact1>, which is 71. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86. We then need to calculate the total score required to achieve an <fact4>average of 93</fact4> for 5 tests (since one score is removed). The total score required is <fact4>93</fact4> * 5 = 465. The total score of the remaining 4 tests is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. So, the required score on the <fact3>sixth test</fact3> is 465 - 367 = 98. The answer is {98}."

Answer: 
To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the number of bandages they had left at the end of the third day. They had <fact7>78 bandages left</fact7> at the end of the third day. On the third day, they ordered <fact2>two bulk packs of bandages</fact2>, which is 2 * <fact1>50</fact1> = 100 bandages, and used <fact3>half a pack</fact3>, which is <fact1>50</fact1>/2 = 25 bandages. So, at the beginning of the third day, they had 78 + 25 - 100 = 3 bandages. 

On the second day, they used <fact4>ten fewer bandages</fact4> compared to the first day, which means they used <fact5>38</fact5> - 10 = 28 bandages. 

On the first day, they used <fact5>38 bandages</fact5> and ordered <fact6>one bulk pack of bandages</fact6>, which is <fact1>50</fact1> bandages.

Answer: 
To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to first determine who the winner is and how long it takes each of them to get home. We know that <fact1>Tim lives 2 miles away from the school</fact1> and that there are 5280 feet in a mile. So, Tim lives 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet away from school. Since <fact4>Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</fact4>, it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to get home. We also know that <fact2>Steve lives 3 miles from the school</fact2>, which is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet away from school. Since <fact3>Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute</fact3>, it will take him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes to get home. Since Steve's time of 36 minutes is less than Tim's time of 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The winner will be waiting 40 - 36 = 4 minutes for the loser to finish the race. The answer is {4}."

How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Reformatted Question: 
Mr. Robles' first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>. Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2>, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for <fact3>a week</fact3>. The second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4> and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Answer: 
Since Mr. Robles buys <fact2>315 bananas</fact2> for his three monkeys for <fact3>a week</fact3>, and there are 7 days in a week, the three monkeys eat a total of <fact2>315 bananas</fact2> / 7 days = 45 bananas per day. The first monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas each day</fact1>, and the second monkey eats <fact4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact4>, so the second monkey eats <fact1>10 bananas</fact1> + <fact4>4 bananas</fact4> = 14 bananas per day. The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. Therefore, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day. The answer is {21}."

Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has <fact1>54 lines in the lyrics</fact1>. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, and <fact3>four-fifths of them are his</fact3>. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, but <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Answer: 
The solo song has <fact1>54 lines in the lyrics</fact1> that Sean needs to memorize. The second scene has <fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>, which is 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since <fact3>four-fifths of them are his</fact3>, Sean needs to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene. The first scene has <fact4>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact4>, which is 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, <fact5>only a third of them are his lines</fact5>, so Sean needs to memorize 108 * 1/3 = 36 lines from the first scene. In total, Sean needs to memorize 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Reformatted Question: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are <fact1>10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone</fact1> and each hamster is given <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2>. The rats are kept in <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3> and each rat is given <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>. There is also a pen of rabbits where <fact5>20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</fact5>. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer: The total number of straws given to the hamsters is <fact1>10 cages of hamsters</fact1> * <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw. The rabbits receive <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5>. So, the total number of straws given to the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw. Since <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, the rats must have received 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw. Since each rat receives <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4> and the rats are divided into <fact3>3 cages in equal groups</fact3>, we can set up the equation: 6 * number of rats in each cage * 3 = 90. Solving for the number of rats in each cage, we get: number of rats in each cage = 90 / (6 * 3) = 5. The answer is {5}."

The <fact1>average car can go 120 Miles per hour</fact1>. What she finds out is that the <fact2>fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car</fact2>. The <fact3>2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car</fact3>. How fast does the faster car go?

Answer: To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we first need to find out how fast the 2nd fastest car can go. Since the <fact3>2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car</fact3>, and the <fact1>average car can go 120 Miles per hour</fact1>, the 2nd fastest car can go <fact3>5 times</fact3> * <fact1>120 Miles per hour</fact1> = 600 Miles per hour. Then, since the <fact2>fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car</fact2>, the fastest car can go <fact2>1.25 times</fact2> * 600 Miles per hour = 750 Miles per hour.

Answer: 
To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit made from selling the cars. The cost of acquiring each car is <fact4>30% of the price</fact4> of the car, which is <fact4>30%</fact4> * <fact3>$25,000</fact3> = $7,500. The profit made from selling each car is <fact3>$25,000</fact3> - $7,500 = $17,500. Since James sold <fact2>10 cars</fact2>, the total profit made is $17,500 * <fact2>10</fact2> = $175,000.

There will be <fact4>30 kids</fact4> and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have <fact5>4 jello cups</fact5>. How much will he spend on jello?

Answer: To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs to make. Since there will be <fact4>30 kids</fact4> and each kid will have <fact5>4 jello cups</fact5>, the total number of jello cups needed is <fact4>30</fact4> * <fact5>4</fact5> = 120 jello cups. 

Since a <fact2>three-ounce box of flavored jello</fact2> makes <fact3>10 small jello cups</fact3>, the total number of boxes needed is 120 / <fact3>10</fact3> = 12 boxes.

There are <fact1>100 plants</fact1> in Mrs. Smith's garden. Among those that are not <fact2>indoor plants</fact2>, <fact3>two-thirds of them are outdoor plants</fact3> while the rest are <fact4>flowering plants</fact4>. <fact5>One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</fact5>. What percent of the plants are <fact4>flowering plants</fact4>?

Answer: 
First, we need to find the number of <fact2>indoor plants</fact2>. Since <fact5>one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</fact5>, we can calculate the number of indoor plants as <fact1>100 plants</fact1> * 1/4 = 25 plants. 

Now, we need to find the number of plants that are not <fact2>indoor plants</fact2>. This is equal to the total number of plants minus the number of indoor plants, which is <fact1>100 plants</fact1> - 25 plants = 75 plants.

Since <fact3>two-thirds of them are outdoor plants</fact3>, we can calculate the number of outdoor plants as 75 plants * 2/3 = 50 plants.

The rest of the plants that are not <fact2>indoor plants</fact2> or outdoor plants are <fact4>flowering plants</fact4>. So, the number of flowering plants is 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of <fact4>flowering plants</fact4>, we can divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. This gives us (25 plants / <fact1>100 plants</fact1>) * 100 = 25%.

Answer: The interior design firm's base offer includes hanging <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>, <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>, and <fact8>10 pictures</fact8> for <fact4>$129.00</fact4>. Angela has <fact1>6 mirrors</fact1>, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors installed. She also has <fact2>2 chandeliers</fact2>, so she needs 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier installed. Additionally, she has <fact3>20 pictures</fact3>, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures installed. In total, she needs 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items installed. Each additional item costs <fact9>$15.00</fact9>, so the total cost for the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

Tom has <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1> in his house. The living room is <fact2>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>. The rest of the house is <fact3>1000 square feet</fact3>. The bedrooms measure <fact4>20 by 12 feet each</fact4>. What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?

Answer: 
To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the area of the rest of the house. The area of one bedroom is <fact4>20 by 12 feet</fact4>, which is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are <fact1>4 bedrooms</fact1>, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet. The living room is <fact2>5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet. The rest of the house is <fact3>1000 square feet</fact3>. Therefore, the total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet. The answer is {3160}."

Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth <fact1>$400</fact1> and another pack worth <fact2>twice that much</fact2>.  He gets a <fact3>20% discount</fact3> on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs <fact4>$150</fact4>.  How much did he spend in total?

Answer: 
The first package of fireworks costs <fact1>$400</fact1>. The second package costs <fact2>twice that much</fact2>, so it costs 2 * <fact1>$400</fact1> = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. With a <fact3>20% discount</fact3>, the cost is reduced by 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. So the discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960. Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is <fact4>$150</fact4>, the total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110. The answer is {1110}."
187,John is a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class.  Ali's class has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?,"Reformatted Question: 
John is a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has <fact1>1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact1>. Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class.  Ali's class has <fact2>a capacity of 120 students</fact2>. What is the combined capacity of both schools?

Answer: 
To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to find the capacity of John's school and Ali's school separately. We know that Ali's class has <fact2>a capacity of 120 students</fact2>. Since Ali teaches one class, the capacity of Ali's school is also 120 students. 

Now, we need to find the capacity of John's school. Each class in John's school has <fact1>1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact1>. Since Ali's class has <fact2>a capacity of 120 students</fact2>, each class in John's school has 120 * 1/8 = 15 students. John has two classes in his school, so the capacity of John's school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacities of John's school and Ali's school, which is 30 + 120 = 150 students. The answer is {150}."

She wanted to try something new, so she paid <fact5>half as much for a small pack of green apple gum</fact5>. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Answer: 
Since Suzie paid <fact5>half as much for the green apple gum</fact5> as she did for the grape gum, she paid <fact4>$2</fact4>/2 = $1 for the green apple gum. So far, she has spent <fact4>$2</fact4> + $1 = $3 on grape and green apple gum. She paid <fact2>$7 in all</fact2>, so she must have spent $7 - $3 = $4 on strawberry gum. Since she bought <fact3>two packs of strawberry gum</fact3>, each pack must have cost $4/2 = $2. The answer is {2}."
189,"Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  In total, he bought 3 packs for $1800 each. How much money profit did he make?","Reformatted Question: 
Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He gets <fact1>1 card that is worth $4000</fact1> and another card worth <fact2>$1000</fact2>.  There are <fact3>30 more cards worth an average of $50 each</fact3>.  In total, he bought <fact4>3 packs for $1800 each</fact4>. How much money profit did he make?

Answer: 
To calculate the profit, we need to find the total value of the cards and subtract the total cost of the packs. The total value of the cards is the sum of the values of the two rare cards and the 30 other cards. The value of the rare cards is <fact1>$4000</fact1> + <fact2>$1000</fact2> = $5000. The value of the other 30 cards is <fact3>30 cards * $50 per card</fact3> = $1500. So, the total value of the cards is $5000 + $1500 = $6500. The total cost of the packs is <fact4>3 packs * $1800 per pack</fact4> = $5400. Therefore, the profit is $6500 - $5400 = $1100. The answer is {1100}."

In the second month, she collected <fact4>20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact4>. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?

Answer: Elaine initially had <fact1>20 Pokemon cards</fact1>. After a month, she collected <fact2>three times that number</fact2>, which is 3 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected <fact4>20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact4>, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. In the third month, she collected <fact3>twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months</fact3>, which is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Answer: 
The first train arrives in <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> and stays for <fact3>20 minutes</fact3>, so it will leave after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes. The second train arrives <fact4>half an hour after the first train leaves</fact4>, so it will arrive after 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for <fact5>a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station</fact5>, which is 20/4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes. The third train arrives <fact7>an hour after the second train leaves the station</fact7>, so it will arrive after 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since <fact8>the third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives</fact8>, it will leave at the same time, 125 minutes. Finally, <fact6>the fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves</fact6>, so it will arrive after 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait 145 minutes for his train. The answer is {145}."

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?

Answer: 
To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days. We know that on <fact2>Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs</fact2>. On <fact1>Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday</fact1>, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on each of those days, for a total of 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs. We also know that <fact3>Thursday she removed 48</fact3> and on <fact4>Friday she removed 57</fact4>. So the total number of Junebugs she removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300. Since she removed Junebugs for 5 days, the average number of Junebugs she removes per day is 300 / 5 = 60. The answer is {60}."

James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>.  He swims <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2>. He can swim at a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how far James swam at his initial pace. Since he swam <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2> of the <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>, he swam 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>, it took him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim that distance. After that, he rested for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. Now, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. Since he is going at <fact5>half the speed</fact5> of his initial pace, he is now swimming at 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, it will take him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. In total, it took James 6 hours to swim the initial distance, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. So, the total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours. The answer is {17}."

Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a <fact1>flat fee of $200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5 for each person</fact3> who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer: 
Let's denote the number of guests as x. The cost of the first venue is the flat fee of <fact1>$200</fact1> plus the cost of food, which is <fact3>$5 per person</fact3> times the number of guests (x). So, the total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> times the number of guests (x), which is 25x. To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other: 200 + 5x = 25x. Subtracting 5x from both sides gives 200 = 20x. Dividing both sides by 20 gives x = 10. Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost. The answer is {10}."
204,"A farmer is baling hay in their field. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?","Reformatted Question: A farmer is baling hay in their field. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up <fact1>3 bales of hay</fact1>. Each hour the farmer makes <fact2>5 bales</fact2>. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a <fact3>6 hour day</fact3>, how many bales of hay are left in the field?

Answer: The farmer makes <fact2>5 bales</fact2> per hour, so in a <fact3>6 hour day</fact3>, the farmer will make <fact2>5 bales</fact2> * <fact3>6 hours</fact3> = 30 bales. The truck picks up <fact1>3 bales of hay</fact1> per hour, so in a <fact3>6 hour day</fact3>, the truck will pick up <fact1>3 bales of hay</fact1> * <fact3>6 hours</fact3> = 18 bales. Therefore, there will be 30 - 18 = 12 bales of hay left in the field. The answer is {12}."

In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set.

In the third set, he retrieved <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>. He retrieved <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>. In the <fact3>first of three sets</fact3>, he had to retrieve <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the <fact3>first set of the match</fact3>?

Answer: Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Then, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>, which is x/2. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>, which is x + 4. The total number of balls retrieved is <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>, so we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x + 8 = 38. This simplifies to 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5 gives x = 6. So, the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10. The answer is {10}."

If Sara <fact5>already had $10 saved before she started babysitting</fact5>, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs <fact1>$30</fact1> and two pairs of shoes cost 2 x <fact2>$20</fact2> = $40. So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70. Sara <fact5>already had $10 saved</fact5> and she earned 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting <fact4>4 times</fact4>. So, she has a total of $10 + $20 = $30. She still needs $70 - $30 = $40 to buy the jacket and shoes. Since her parents pay her <fact3>$4 each time she mows the lawn</fact3>, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Answer: 
In the <fact1>first year, the town will build 12 homes</fact1>. In the <fact3>second year, they will build three times as many homes as they built in the first year</fact3>, so they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

However, this is the number of homes they will have built by the end of the second year doubled, not the number of new homes they will build in the third year. To find the number of new homes built in the third year, we need to subtract the number of homes already built from the total at the end of the third year.

First, let's calculate how many sticks he can get per dollar for each type of wood. For a <fact1>2 x 4 costing $4</fact1>, he gets <fact3>200 sticks</fact3>, so that's 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For a <fact2>2 x 8 costing $6</fact2>, he gets <fact4>400 sticks</fact4>, so that's 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since the 2 x 8 gives him more sticks per dollar, it's the cheapest option in terms of sticks per dollar. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy with his budget of <fact5>$24</fact5>. He can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him <fact4>400 sticks</fact4>, he can get a total of 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks. The answer is {1600}."

She got a <fact1>case of 12 sodas</fact1> and shook <fact2>3 of them up</fact2>. Ellen's brother stopped by and took <fact3>1 of the shaken sodas</fact3> and <fact4>2 of the unshaken sodas</fact4>, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5> for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Answer: There were originally <fact2>3 shaken sodas</fact2> out of <fact1>12 total sodas</fact1>. Ellen's brother took <fact3>1 shaken soda</fact3> and <fact4>2 unshaken sodas</fact4>, leaving 3 - <fact3>1</fact3> = 2 shaken sodas and 9 - <fact4>2</fact4> = 7 unshaken sodas. Ellen then took <fact5>1 unshaken soda</fact5> for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 - <fact5>1</fact5> = 6 unshaken sodas. So, there are 2 shaken sodas out of 2 + 6 = 8 total sodas left. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is therefore 2/8 = 0.25, or 25%. The answer is {25}."
224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"Reformatted Question: 
Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> and she spits each one <fact2>10 feet</fact2>.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> she spits each one <fact4>12 feet</fact4>. What is the average total distance spat?

Answer: 
To find the average total distance spat, we need to first find the total distance spat by each person. Zoey spits <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 400 feet. Sydney spits <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> * <fact4>12 feet</fact4> = 420 feet. The total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet. To find the average, we divide the total distance by the number of people, which is 2. So, the average total distance spat is 820 / 2 = 410 feet. The answer is {410}."
225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reformatted Question: 
Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours <fact2>4 ounces of water</fact2> from the <fact3>33-degree mug</fact3> into his water bottle and <fact4>one ounce</fact4> from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Answer: 
To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the scenario where the final temperature of the mixed water is exactly <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>. Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When Donny pours <fact2>4 ounces of water</fact2> from the <fact3>33-degree mug</fact3> and <fact4>one ounce</fact4> from the second bottle, the total amount of water becomes 4 + 1 = 5 ounces. We can set up an equation based on the heat transfer:

(4 ounces * <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * <fact5>40 degrees</fact5>

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees. The answer is {68}."
226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Reformatted Question: 
Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>.  Over the <fact2>third year it depreciated 20%</fact2>.  Over the <fact3>first year it depreciated 30%</fact3>.  The <fact4>second year it depreciated another 30%</fact4>. How much is the boat worth after the three years?

Answer: 
To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. The boat depreciated by <fact3>30%</fact3> in the first year, so its value after the first year is <fact1>$9000</fact1> - (<fact1>$9000</fact1> * <fact3>0.30</fact3>) = $9000 - $2700 = $6300. 

In the second year, the boat depreciated by <fact4>another 30%</fact4>, so its value after the second year is $6300 - ($6300 * <fact4>0.30</fact4>) = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by <fact2>20%</fact2>, so its value after the third year is $4410 - ($4410 * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The answer is {3528}."

At the end of the year, only <fact3>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact3> were left. There are <fact4>30 students</fact4> in Marissa's class. How many pencils were left?

Answer: 
There are <fact4>30 students</fact4> in Marissa's class, and each student started with <fact1>10 pencils</fact1>, so the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is <fact4>30 students</fact4> * <fact1>10 pencils</fact1> = 300 pencils. After two months, <fact2>1/5 of the total pencils in class</fact2> were used, so the number of pencils used is 300 * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 60 pencils. This leaves 300 - 60 = 240 pencils. At the end of the year, only <fact3>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact3> were left, so the number of pencils left is 240 * <fact3>1/3</fact3> = 80 pencils. The answer is {80}."
