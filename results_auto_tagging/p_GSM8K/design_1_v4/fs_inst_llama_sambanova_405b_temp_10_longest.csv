She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Reformatted Question: Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. The bids on the desk <fact1>rise by $50 each time</fact1> and <fact2>3 other people each bid once</fact2>. She accepts the <fact3>opening bid of $200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Answer: The opening bid is <fact3>$200</fact3>. Each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2> will increase the bid by <fact1>$50</fact1>, so after they have all bid, the total will be <fact3>$200</fact3> + <fact2>3 people</fact2> * <fact1>$50 per person</fact1> = $350. Since Carmen bids after each of the <fact2>3 other people</fact2>, she will have to bid 3 more times, adding <fact1>$50</fact1> * <fact2>3 people</fact2> = $150 to the total. Therefore, the desk will cost her $350 + $150 = $500. The answer is {500}."

For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Reformatted Question: Steve loves playing video games. His parents get him a console along with <fact1>5 games for his birthday</fact1>. For the <fact2>third year</fact2> he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money. He also gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>. He saves up enough money to buy <fact5>1 game per month for a year</fact5>, and then the <fact6>second year</fact6> he starts buying <fact7>2 games a month</fact7>. How many games does Steve have after <fact8>3 years</fact8>?

Answer: Steve starts with <fact1>5 games</fact1>. For the first year, he buys <fact5>1 game per month</fact5> * 12 months = 12 games and gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas</fact4>, for a total of 12 + 5 = 17 games. For the <fact6>second year</fact6>, he buys <fact7>2 games a month</fact7> * 12 months = 24 games and gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas</fact4>, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. For the <fact2>third year</fact2>, he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3> * 12 months = 48 games and gets <fact4>5 games for Christmas</fact4>, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. So, after <fact8>3 years</fact8>, Steve has 5 + 17 + 29 + 53 = 104 games. The answer is {104}."
2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted Question: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. It takes Billy about <fact2>a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but only about <fact3>5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Answer: It takes Billy <fact2>1.5 minutes to peel a potato</fact2> and <fact3>5 seconds (which is 5/60=1/12 minutes) to cut it up</fact3>. So, it takes him 1.5 + 1/12 = 1.5833 minutes to peel and cut a potato. Since he has <fact1>60 potatoes</fact1> to get through, it will take him 1.5833 * <fact1>60</fact1> = 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. The answer is {95}."
3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted Question: James gets <fact1>10 new CDs</fact1>. He decides he doesn't like <fact2>5 of them</fact2> and sells them for <fact3>$40</fact3>. Each CD cost <fact4>$15</fact4>. He gets them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>. How much money was he out?

Answer: James bought <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> at <fact4>$15</fact4> each, but he got them for <fact5>40% off</fact5>, so he paid only 60% of the original price. The original price of the CDs was <fact1>10</fact1> * <fact4>$15</fact4> = $150. James paid 60% of this, which is 0.6 * $150 = $90. He then sold <fact2>5 CDs</fact2> for <fact3>$40</fact3>, so he got some of his money back. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - <fact3>$40</fact3> = $50. The answer is {50}."
4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1>. <fact2>One-fourth of the seats</fact2> were occupied by the administrators. <fact3>One-third of the remaining seats</fact3> were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1> and <fact4>4 rows of seats</fact4>, the total number of seats is <fact1>18</fact1> * <fact4>4</fact4> = 72 seats. 

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since <fact2>one-fourth of the seats</fact2> were occupied by the administrators, the number of seats occupied by the administrators is 72 * 1/4 = 18 seats.

Now, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. Since <fact3>one-third of the remaining seats</fact3> were occupied by the parents, we first need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats. The number of remaining seats is 72 - 18 = 54 seats. Then, the number of seats occupied by the parents is 54 * 1/3 = 18 seats.

Finally, we can find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the administrators and the parents from the total number of seats. The number of seats occupied by the students is 72 - 18 - 18 = 36 seats.

The answer is {36}."
5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>bag of glass chips holds 72 chips</fact1>. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2>three inches tall</fact2>. It takes <fact3>twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic</fact3>. If he has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer: Milo has <fact4>two bags of glass chips</fact4> * <fact1>72 chips per bag</fact1> = 144 chips. Since it takes <fact3>12 chips per square inch</fact3>, he can make 144 / <fact3>12 chips per square inch</fact3> = 12 square inches. Since the mosaic is <fact2>3 inches tall</fact2>, he can make it 12 / <fact2>3 inches tall</fact2> = 4 inches long. The answer is {4}."
6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","Reformatted Question: Bernie has <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>. The first needs to walk <fact2>1 mile</fact2>. On average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk <fact4>4 miles</fact4>. The third needs to walk <fact5>3 miles</fact5>. How many miles does the last dog need?

Answer: Since there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> and we know the walking distances for 3 of them, we can calculate the total walking distance for those 3 dogs. The total distance is <fact2>1 mile</fact2> + <fact4>4 miles</fact4> + <fact5>3 miles</fact5> = 8 miles. Since on average, they need to walk <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3>, the total distance for all 4 dogs should be <fact1>4 dogs</fact1> * <fact3>3 miles per day</fact3> = 12 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles. The answer is {4}."
7,"A perfume company is trying to create new scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?","Reformatted Question: A perfume company is trying to create new scents.

They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?

Answer: The total number of vanilla scents sold is <fact1>5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> * <fact3>4 vanilla scents</fact3> = 20 vanilla scents. The total number of fruity scents sold is <fact2>2 of each of the fruity scents</fact2> * <fact4>8 fruity scents</fact4> = 16 fruity scents. Therefore, the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4. The answer is {4}."
8,"Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","Reformatted Question: Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do <fact1>$450 worth of damage</fact1> to his car. Ron will also have to buy <fact2>3 buckets of asphalt</fact2> that each cost <fact3>$25</fact3> to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron <fact4>$120</fact4> for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Answer: If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will have to pay for the asphalt, which costs <fact2>3 buckets</fact2> * <fact3>$25 per bucket</fact3> = $75. He will also have to pay the fine, which is <fact4>$120</fact4>. So the total cost of fixing the pothole himself is $75 + $120 = $195. If he doesn't fix the pothole, he will have to pay for the damage to his car, which is <fact1>$450</fact1>. Therefore, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255 by fixing the pothole. The answer is {255}."
9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","Reformatted Question: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom. His bedroom measures <fact1>18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>. His contractor charges <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> to remove the old carpet, and <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> to install the new carpet. The new carpet he's chosen costs <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5>$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>. How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

Answer: To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom first. The area is <fact1>18 feet</fact1> * <fact1>12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet. The cost to remove the old carpet is <fact2>$4 per square foot</fact2> * 216 square feet = $864. The cost to install the new carpet is <fact3>$34 per square foot</fact3> * 216 square feet = $7344. The cost of the new carpet itself is <fact4>$12 per square foot</fact4> * 216 square feet = $2592. The cost of the padding is <fact5>$2 per square foot</fact5> * 216 square feet = $432. Therefore, the total cost is $864 + $7344 + $2592 + $432 = $11232. The answer is {11232}."

If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted Question: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers <fact3>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact3> and <fact4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact4>. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of <fact5>500 apples</fact5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Answer: Joanne gathered <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1> and <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, which is <fact1>30</fact1>/2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered <fact3>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact3>, which is <fact1>30</fact1>*2 = 60 apples, and <fact4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact4>, which is 15*3 = 45 apples. So, in total, Joanne and her sister gathered <fact1>30</fact1> + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. Since they gathered a combined total of <fact5>500 apples</fact5>, Joanne must have gathered 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is {350}."
11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.

Pat's flowers grow <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: Pat's flowers are <fact3>12 inches wide</fact3>, which is 1 foot wide. Since she needs to leave <fact4>1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>, each flower will take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet of space. Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1>111 feet long</fact1>, so she can fit 111 / 2.5 = 44.4 flowers in her bed. Since she can't buy a fraction of a flower, she can fit 44 flowers in her bed. Pat already owns <fact2>17 flowers</fact2>, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 flowers. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$6 at the store</fact5>, so she will spend 27 x $6 = $162.

He also watched <fact4>3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact4>. How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Answer: To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on vacation. We know that he spent <fact2>30% of the time</fact2> on events, and we can calculate the total time spent on these events. He spent <fact3>6 hours boating</fact3> and half that time swimming, which is 6/2 = 3 hours. He also watched <fact4>3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact4>, for a total of 3 x 2 = 6 hours. So the total time spent on these events is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. Since this is <fact2>30% of the time</fact2>, we can set up the equation 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation. Solving for x, we get x = 15/0.3 = 50 hours. Now that we know the total time spent on vacation, we can find the time spent sightseeing. <fact1>40% of his time</fact1> was spent sightseeing, so we can calculate 0.4 x 50 = 20 hours. The answer is {20}."

Answer: Kim has a total of <fact1>3 clients</fact1> + <fact2>5 potential clients</fact2> = 8 clients. Each client requires <fact6>2 bottles of bleach</fact6> * <fact3>$2 per bottle</fact3> = $4 of bleach and <fact7>a pack of cloths</fact7> * <fact4>$5 per pack</fact4> = $5 of cloths.

Answer: Since <fact3>50% of the choir members are girls</fact3>, the number of girls in the choir is <fact1>52</fact1> * <fact3>0.5</fact3> = 26. Since the choir decides to perform with just its <fact4>female members</fact4>, 26 girls are supposed to perform. However, <fact6>half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show</fact6>, so only 26 / 2 = 13 girls can perform. The choir's <fact5>3 teachers</fact5> also decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16. The answer is {16}."

If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer: The teacher started with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1> and used <fact4>45% of the chalk</fact4> on the first day. So he has 5 - 5 * <fact4>0.45</fact4> = 2.75 inches of chalk left. The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>. So he can use 2.75 - <fact2>2</fact2> = 0.75 inches of chalk before recycling it. The teacher will use <fact3>20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, which is 5 * <fact3>0.2</fact3> = 1 inch per day for a new piece of chalk. However, the chalk is not new and only 0.75 inches can be used. So the teacher can use the chalk for 0.75 / 1 * 5 = 3.75 days for a new piece of chalk. Since the chalk is not new, the teacher can use the chalk for 3.75 / 5 * 5 = 3.75 days for the remaining 5 inches, but for only 0.75 inch of chalk that can be used, the teacher can use it for 3.75 / 5 * (5/0.75) = 3 days before it is smaller than <fact2>2 inches</fact2>."

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.  How many cookies does Jenny eat?,"Reformatted Question: Jenny buys <fact1>1 bag of cookies a week</fact1>. Her husband eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>. The bag has <fact3>36 cookies</fact3> and she puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>. Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. How many cookies does Jenny eat?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. He eats <fact2>1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies. Next, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box in a week. She puts <fact4>4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>, so she puts 4 * 5 = 20 cookies in her son's lunch box. Now, let's calculate how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat. There are <fact3>36 cookies</fact3> in the bag, and her husband eats 7 cookies and her son eats 20 cookies, so there are 36 - 7 - 20 = 9 cookies left for Jenny to eat. The answer is {9}."
19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted Question: A gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1> and cost <fact2>$12</fact2>. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Answer: To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. The north and south walls are <fact3>10 x 8 feet</fact3>, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are <fact4>5 x 8 feet</fact4>, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet. The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since a gallon of paint can cover <fact1>20 square feet</fact1>, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint. Each gallon costs <fact2>$12</fact2>, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144. The answer is {144}."

In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","Reformatted Question: On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. <fact2>24 guests elected an early checkout</fact2> and <fact3>15 elected for a late checkout</fact3>. <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner</fact4> was served. In the afternoon <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>. How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?

Answer: The hotel started with <fact1>100 guests</fact1>. After <fact2>24 guests elected an early checkout</fact2>, there were 100 - 24 = 76 guests. Then, in the afternoon, <fact5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>, which is 2 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 30 guests. So, the total number of guests became 76 + 30 = 106. After <fact3>15 elected for a late checkout</fact3>, the number of guests became 106 - 15 = 91. Finally, after <fact4>7 more people checked in after dinner</fact4>, the total number of guests became 91 + 7 = 98. The answer is {98}."

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","Reformatted Question: Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose <fact1>30 lbs</fact1>. by his birthday, which is <fact2>July 19th</fact2>. If Andy needs to burn <fact3>3500 calories</fact3> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many days Andy has to reach his goal. Since today is December 31st and his birthday is <fact2>July 19th</fact2>, we can count the days in between. December has 31 days, so the rest of December is 0 days. January (31 days), February (28 days), March (31 days), April (30 days), May (31 days), June (30 days), and July (19 days) add up to 200 days. So, Andy has 200 days to lose <fact1>30 lbs</fact1>. Since Andy needs to burn <fact3>3500 calories</fact3> to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of <fact1>30</fact1> x <fact3>3500</fact3> = 105000 calories. To find out how much of a calorie deficit he needs each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105000 / 200 = 525 calories. The answer is {525}."

Answer: Artie sells <fact1>marigolds for $2.74 per pot</fact1>, but he rounds to the nearest dollar, so he sells them for $3. He sells <fact4>12 pots of marigolds</fact4>, so he makes $3 * <fact4>12</fact4> = $36 from marigolds. Artie sells <fact2>petunias for $1.87 per pot</fact2>, but he rounds to the nearest dollar, so he sells them for $2. He sells <fact5>9 pots of petunias</fact5>, so he makes $2 * <fact5>9</fact5> = $18 from petunias.

Answer: In the first 30 seconds, <fact4>20 kernels popped</fact4>. In the next 30 seconds, <fact5>three times that amount</fact5> popped, which is 20 * 3 = 60 kernels. So in the first 60 seconds, 20 + 60 = 80 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is <fact1>four times the initial popping rate</fact1>, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

A watermelon costs <fact5>three times what each pepper costs</fact5>. What's the total amount of money he will spend if <fact6>each pepper costs 15$</fact6>?

Answer: Since <fact5>a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs</fact5> and <fact6>each pepper costs 15$</fact6>, a watermelon costs 3 * <fact6>15$</fact6> = 45$. Since <fact1>an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost</fact1>, an orange costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$. The total cost of <fact2>4 watermelons</fact2> is 4 * 45$ = 180$.

Answer: Johnny's dad lost <fact2>$5</fact2> on the first race. On the second race, he won <fact1>$1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</fact1>, which is 2 * <fact2>$5</fact2> + $1 = $11. On the third race, he lost <fact3>1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</fact3>, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. So, he lost a total of <fact2>$5</fact2> + $16.50 = $21.50. Since he won $11, his net loss is $21.50 - $11 = $10.50. To find the average loss, we divide the net loss by the number of races, which is 3. Therefore, the average loss is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50. The answer is {3.50}."

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"Reformatted Question: A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends. Jack can play a game with <fact1>1 quarter</fact1> for <fact2>20 minutes</fact2>. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play <fact3>half as long</fact3>. They play for <fact4>4 hours</fact4>. One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <fact5>1.5 times as long</fact5>. How much money is used?

Answer: Jack can play for <fact2>20 minutes</fact2> per quarter. Two of his friends can play for <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact3>0.5</fact3> = 10 minutes per quarter. One of his friends can play for <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact5>1.5</fact5> = 30 minutes per quarter. They play for <fact4>4 hours</fact4>, which is 240 minutes. Jack will use 240 / <fact2>20</fact2> = 12 quarters. Two of his friends will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. One of his friends will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters. In total, they will use 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they will use 68 * $0.25 = $17. The answer is {17}."

A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"Reformatted Question: Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has <fact1>600 movies</fact1>.  <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series</fact2> are older movies which are <fact3>$5</fact3>.  <fact4>A third of the movies are in various series</fact4> and he knows he can get those for only <fact5>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact5> by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if <fact6>a normal movie costs $10</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many movies are in series and how many are not. Since <fact4>a third of the movies are in series</fact4>, the number of movies in series is <fact1>600</fact1> / 3 = 200. The number of movies not in series is <fact1>600</fact1> - 200 = 400. Then, we can calculate the number of older movies that are not in series, which is <fact2>40% of the remaining movies that are not in series</fact2>, or 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies. These movies cost <fact3>$5</fact3> each, so the total cost for these movies is 160 * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $800. The remaining movies that are not in series are 400 - 160 = 240, and they cost <fact6>$10</fact6> each, so the total cost for these movies is 240 * <fact6>$10</fact6> = $2400. The movies in series cost <fact5>$6 of the cost of a normal movie</fact5>, or 200 * (<fact6>$10</fact6> - <fact5>$6</fact5>) = 200 * $4 = $800. Therefore, the total cost of replacing the movies is $800 + $2400 + $800 = $4000. The answer is {4000}."

Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact4>. How many students are leaving early?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are football players. <fact2>20% of the class are football players</fact2>, so the number of football players is <fact2>20%</fact2> * <fact1>30 students</fact1> = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students. The <fact3>remaining class</fact3> will be <fact1>30 students</fact1> - 6 students = 24 students. Then, we need to find out how many students are cheerleaders or part of the band. <fact4>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact4> in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, so the number of cheerleaders or part of the band is <fact4>25%</fact4> * 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Answer: On the first day, Wanda filled <fact1>1/4 of the tank's capacity</fact1>, which is <fact1>1/4</fact1> * <fact5>18000 gallons</fact5> = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact2>3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped</fact2>, which is <fact2>3/4</fact2> * 4500 = 3375 gallons. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact3>2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact3>, which is <fact3>2/3</fact3> * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped <fact4>1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact4>, which is <fact4>1/3</fact4> * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. Since the tank has a <fact5>capacity of 18000 gallons</fact5>, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons. The answer is {6000}."

In the end, the charge remaining was <fact3>28%</fact3>. <fact4>5 hours</fact4> after charging the battery started to lose instead <fact5>7% of the total capacity each hour</fact5> for about <fact6>3 hours</fact6>. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer: Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x. Since the power bank was losing <fact2>9% of the total capacity each hour</fact2> for <fact4>5 hours</fact4>, it lost a total of 5 * 9% = 45% of its capacity. After that, it lost <fact5>7% of the total capacity each hour</fact5> for <fact6>3 hours</fact6>, which is an additional 21% of its capacity. So, the total capacity lost is 45% + 21% = 66%. Since the charge remaining was <fact3>28%</fact3>, we can set up the equation: x - 66% * x = 28% * x. Solving for x, we get x = 28% / (1 - 0.66) = 82.35%. However, since the power bank <fact1>wasn't fully charged yet</fact1> when Maria went out, the initial charge must be less than 100%. Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is 82.35%. The answer is {82.35}."

Before gathering, Jim collected <fact2>27 seashells</fact2>, which was <fact3>5 more than what Carlos collected</fact3>. Carlos collected <fact4>twice as many as Carrey</fact4>. How many did each person get?

Answer: Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Since <fact4>Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact4>, Carlos collected 2x seashells. As <fact3>Jim collected 5 more than what Carlos collected</fact3>, Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells. We are given that <fact2>Jim collected 27 seashells</fact2>, so 2x + 5 = 27. Solving for x, we get x = 11. Therefore, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2x = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells. Since they <fact1>divided them equally between themselves</fact1>, the total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60. Dividing this total by 3, each person gets 60/3 = 20 seashells.

In the last 6 hours, she saw <fact3>two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive</fact3> fly from the hive, which is <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>30</fact1> = 60 bees leave. Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours minus the number of bees that returned in the second 6 hours, which is <fact1>30</fact1> - 15 = 15. However, this is not the total number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, because the 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours are not relevant to the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours. But the question states that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. So the 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours are the bees that left after the first and second 6 hours, the bees that are not included in the <fact1>30 bees</fact1> that left in the first 6 hours are the bees that left in the third 6 hours, the bees that left in the second 6 hours are included in the <fact1>30 bees</fact1> that left in the first 6 hours, the bees that left in the second 6 hours are the bees that returned in the second 6 hours, so the bees that left in the second 6 hours are the 15 bees that returned in the second 6 hours, the bees that left in the second 6 hours are not the bees that left in the first 6 hours, the bees that left in the first 6 hours are the bees that did not return in the second 6 hours, the bees that did not return in the second 6 hours are the bees that returned in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours minus the number of bees that returned in the second 6 hours, the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours is <fact1>30 bees</fact1>, the number of bees that returned in the second 6 hours is 15, so the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is <fact1>30</fact1> - 15 = 15, plus the number of bees that left in the second 6 hours, the number of bees that left in the second 6 hours is the number of bees that returned in the second 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the second 6 hours is 15. The answer is {30}."

Answer: Mr. Tan paid <fact1>3% of the selling price</fact1> for transfer fees, which is <fact1>3%</fact1> * <fact3>$400 000</fact3> = $12 000. He also paid <fact2>5% of the selling price</fact2> for brokerage fees, which is <fact2>5%</fact2> * <fact3>$400 000</fact3> = $20 000. So the total fees paid is $12 000 + $20 000 = $32 000. Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is <fact3>$400 000</fact3> - $32 000 - <fact4>$250 000</fact4> = $118 000. The answer is {118000}."

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Answer: Since <fact3>Tobias howls for 20 seconds</fact3>, and <fact1>Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</fact1>, Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Since <fact2>Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact2>, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 120 / 60 = 2 minutes. The answer is {2}."

Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Answer: The shirt originally costs <fact2>$25</fact2>, but with the <fact3>30% off sale</fact3>, Joe will only pay 70% of the original price. 70% of <fact2>$25</fact2> is 0.7 x <fact2>25</fact2> = $17.50.

Each of the <fact3>middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books</fact3>. If she has <fact4>110 books</fact4>, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Answer: Since the <fact3>middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books</fact3> each, and the <fact1>bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf</fact1>, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The <fact2>top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf</fact2>, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books. Each bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the <fact5>minimum threshold is 400 points</fact5>?

Answer: To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by all students. We know that <fact1>Adam has 50 points</fact1>. We also know that <fact4>Betty collected 30% more points than Adam</fact4>, so Betty has 50 + 0.3 * 50 = 65 points. Since <fact3>Tom has 30 points less than Betty</fact3>, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. We also know that <fact2>Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points. Now, we can calculate the total points collected by all students: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

Bob started with <fact3>7 fish in his pond</fact3>. <fact4>3 were orange</fact4>, and <fact5>4 were white</fact5>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Answer: Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as x and the number of orange fish he bought as y. We know that x + y = <fact1>17</fact1>. We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had <fact2>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact2>. Initially, Bob had <fact4>3 orange fish</fact4> and <fact5>4 white fish</fact5>. So, the total number of orange fish after adding the new fish is <fact4>3</fact4> + y, and the total number of white fish is <fact5>4</fact5> + x. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation: <fact4>3</fact4> + y = 2*(<fact5>4</fact5> + x). We can simplify this equation to y = 2x + <fact5>5</fact5>. Now we can substitute y = 2x + <fact5>5</fact5> into the equation x + y = <fact1>17</fact1> to get x + 2x + <fact5>5</fact5> = <fact1>17</fact1>. Solving for x, we get 3x = <fact1>17</fact1> - <fact5>5</fact5> = 12, so x = 4. The answer is {4}."

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Reformatted Question: A toy manufacturer receives an order for <fact1>400 toys</fact1>. <fact2>5 workers</fact2> are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their <fact3>10-hour shift</fact3>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another <fact4>20 toys</fact4> to be able to ship the order. <fact5>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, and another <fact6>2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Answer: The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is (<fact5>2 workers</fact5> * 6 toys/hour) + (<fact6>2 workers</fact6> * 4 toys/hour) = 12 + 8 = 20 toys/hour. The total number of toys produced by all workers in <fact3>10 hours</fact3> is <fact1>400 toys</fact1> - <fact4>20 toys</fact4> = 380 toys. The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in <fact3>10 hours</fact3> is 20 toys/hour * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 200 toys. The total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in <fact3>10 hours</fact3> is 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys. The number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 180 toys / <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 18 toys/hour. The answer is {18}."
74,"Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.   Stephen added a $4.00 tip. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final bill and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","Reformatted Question: Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to <fact1>$40.00</fact1>.   Stephen added a <fact2>$4.00 tip</fact2>. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a <fact3>25% fee</fact3> to his final bill and charged him <fact4>$3.00 in delivery fees</fact4>.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

Answer: The total cost of the groceries before the extra fees is <fact1>$40.00</fact1> + <fact2>$4.00</fact2> = $44.00. The <fact3>25% fee</fact3> is equal to 0.25 * $44.00 = $11.00.

76,Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"Reformatted Question: Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is <fact1>.15 cubic inches</fact1>. He also knows that they get about <fact2>80% efficiency in packing</fact2>. He estimates <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>. The jar has a square base and is <fact4>6 inches by 6 inches</fact4> and <fact5>15 inches tall</fact5>. The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact6>900</fact6>. How far off was his guess?

Answer: To find the volume of the jar, we multiply the area of the base by the height. The area of the base is <fact4>6 inches</fact4> * <fact4>6 inches</fact4> = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height, we get 36 * <fact5>15 inches</fact5> = 540 cubic inches. Since a jelly bean is <fact1>.15 cubic inches</fact1>, we can fit 540 / <fact1>.15</fact1> = 3600 jelly beans in the jar if it were packed perfectly. However, since the jar is only packed with <fact2>80% efficiency</fact2>, we can only fit 3600 * <fact2>.8</fact2> = 2880 jelly beans in the jar. Since <fact3>30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>, there are 2880 * <fact3>.3</fact3> = 864 red jelly beans in the jar. The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact6>900</fact6>, so Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36. The answer is {36}."

She also ordered <fact2>200 pink calla lilies</fact2>, which were <fact3>five times the number of white carnations</fact3>. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?

Answer: Since Sandra ordered <fact2>200 pink calla lilies</fact2> and this is <fact3>five times the number of white carnations</fact3>, then the number of white carnations is <fact2>200</fact2>/<fact3>5</fact3> = 40. Since Sandra ordered <fact1>four times as many red roses as white carnations</fact1>, then the number of red roses is <fact1>four times</fact1> the number of white carnations, which is 4 * 40 = 160.

78,Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.  One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"Reformatted Question: Sidney ordered <fact1>3 less than ten</fact1> meatball sub sandwiches.

How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?

Answer: Sidney initially ordered <fact1>3 less than ten</fact1> = 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since one meatball sub sandwich contains <fact2>4 meatballs</fact2>, Sidney initially had 7 * <fact2>4</fact2> = 28 meatballs. Mark ate <fact3>4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches</fact3>, which means Mark ate 4 * <fact2>4</fact2> = 16 meatballs. After Mark ate, Sidney had 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs left. Then, Sidney ordered another <fact4>three sub sandwiches</fact4>, which means he got 3 * <fact2>4</fact2> = 12 more meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 12 + 12 = 24. The answer is {24}."

The friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5> away. How long did the trip take?

Answer: The trip to his friend's house is <fact5>200 miles</fact5> + <fact2>10 miles</fact2> = 210 miles. At a speed of <fact1>70 mph</fact1>, it will take him 210 miles / <fact1>70 mph</fact1> = 3 hours to get to his friend's house. The trip back home is <fact3>240 miles</fact3> at a speed of <fact4>80 mph</fact4>, so it will take him <fact3>240 miles</fact3> / <fact4>80 mph</fact4> = 3 hours to get back home.

The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","Reformatted Question: Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The <fact1>tattered jeans cost $28</fact1> while the <fact2>jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans</fact2>. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He <fact3>saved a total of $6</fact3>. If he <fact4>saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4> and <fact5>the rest from the tattered jeans</fact5>, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Answer: The jogger jeans originally cost <fact1>$28</fact1> - <fact2>$6</fact2> = $22. Since Cole <fact3>saved a total of $6</fact3>, and he <fact4>saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4>, he saved 1/3 * <fact3>$6</fact3> = $2 from the jogger jeans. This means the jogger jeans were on sale for $22 - $2 = $20. He saved the rest, <fact3>$6</fact3> - $2 = $4, from the tattered jeans. So the tattered jeans were on sale for <fact1>$28</fact1> - $4 = $24. To find the difference in original price, we need to compare the original prices. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, but since the jogger jeans are actually cheaper, we need to reverse the comparison. The tattered jeans originally cost $28, and the jogger jeans originally cost $22, so the tattered jeans cost $28 - $22 = $6 more than the jogger jeans. Since the question asks for the opposite, we can say the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, but to answer the question directly, we need to say the jogger jeans cost -$6 more than the tattered jeans. However, since a negative answer does not make sense in this context, we can rephrase the answer to say that the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is {-6}."
81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000.

He uses <fact2>60% of that</fact2> to pay off his debts. His house is worth <fact3>$250,000</fact3>. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?

Answer: John's house is worth <fact3>$250,000</fact3>, so he gets a loan of <fact1>40%</fact1> * <fact3>$250,000</fact3> = $100,000.

The room will warm up at <fact6>2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running</fact6>. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

Answer: The air conditioner cools the room <fact4>2 degrees an hour on low</fact4> * <fact1>3 hours</fact1> = 6 degrees while it was on low. It then cools the room <fact5>3 degrees an hour on high</fact5> * <fact2>4 hours</fact2> = 12 degrees while it was on high. So, in total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. Afterward, the room warmed up <fact6>2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running</fact6> * <fact3>2 hours</fact3> = 4 degrees.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","Reformatted Question: Martha is knitting winter wear for her <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1>. It takes <fact2>2 skeins of wool to make a hat</fact2>, <fact3>4 for a scarf</fact3>, <fact4>12 for a sweater</fact4>, <fact5>1 for a pair of mittens</fact5>, and <fact6>2 for a pair of socks</fact6>. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of wool required for each item of clothing for her <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1>. For hats, she will need <fact2>2 skeins of wool</fact2> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins. For scarves, she will need <fact3>4 skeins of wool</fact3> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 12 skeins. For sweaters, she will need <fact4>12 skeins of wool</fact4> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 36 skeins. For mittens, she will need <fact5>1 skein of wool</fact5> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 3 skeins. For socks, she will need <fact6>2 skeins of wool</fact6> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins. Therefore, the total number of skeins of wool she needs to buy is 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63. The answer is {63}."

If it takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?

Answer: Since Bernadette wants to arrive <fact1>5 minutes before Wayne</fact1>, and it takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater in <fact3>4</fact3> - <fact1>5</fact1> = -1 minute, relative to Wayne's arrival time. However, the question asks for how much earlier Bernadette should leave, not arrive. The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes <fact2>four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel</fact2>, so it will take Bernadette <fact2>four times</fact2> * <fact3>four minutes</fact3> = 16 minutes to be driven to the theater. Since it takes Wayne <fact3>four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, Bernadette needs to leave 16 - <fact3>4</fact3> + <fact1>5</fact1> = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne. The answer is {17}."

Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.

Answer: On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact3>20 White Oak trees</fact3> and <fact4>twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees</fact4>, which is 2 * <fact3>20</fact3> = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the first day, he planted <fact3>20</fact3> + 40 = 60 trees. On the second day, Mr. Julius planted <fact1>10 more White Oak trees</fact1> than the first day, which is <fact3>20</fact3> + <fact1>10</fact1> = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted <fact2>1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees</fact2> than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the second day, he planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4> and he also gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer: John goes to work <fact1>5 days a week</fact1> for <fact2>50 weeks a year</fact2>, so he goes to work a total of <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact2>50</fact2> = 250 days per year. Since his work is <fact3>30 miles away</fact3> and he has to go there and back each day, the total distance driven per day is <fact3>30</fact3> * 2 = 60 miles. He gets charged <fact4>$2 per mile driven</fact4>, so the cost per day is 60 * <fact4>$2</fact4> = $120. The total cost for 250 days is $120 * 250 = $30,000. Additionally, he gives his driver a <fact5>$150 bonus per month</fact5>, so the total bonus per year is <fact5>$150</fact5> * 12 = $1,800.

Originally, he wanted to make <fact4>twice as many as he did last year</fact4>. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. This year, he wanted to bake <fact4>twice as many as he did last year</fact4>, so he wanted to bake 2x cookies. However, he actually baked <fact1>15 more cookies than he meant to</fact1>, so he baked 2x + <fact1>15</fact1> cookies. After dropping <fact2>5 cookies</fact2>, he had 2x + <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact3>110</fact3> cookies. We can set up the equation 2x + <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = <fact3>110</fact3> and solve for x. 2x + 10 = 110, so 2x = 100, and x = 50. The answer is {50}."

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact3>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer: There is a <fact2>50% chance of having a substitute teacher</fact2> who won't collect homework, so in that case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there is a <fact1>40% chance of a class extension</fact1>, and if that doesn't happen, there is a <fact3>20% chance of a personal extension</fact3>. So the chance of not having to turn in homework with the normal teacher is <fact1>40%</fact1> + (<fact3>20%</fact3> * (100% - <fact1>40%</fact1>)) = 40% + (20% * 60%) = 40% + 12% = 52%. The overall chance of not having to turn in homework is <fact2>50%</fact2> + (50% * 52%) = 50% + 26% = 76%. Therefore, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%. The answer is {24}."
112,Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted Question: Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each <fact1>large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>. A <fact2>small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>. A <fact3>large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>. Lorraine starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact6>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact6> and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades <fact7>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact7>. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Answer: Lorraine starts with <fact5>40 large stickers</fact5> and trades <fact6>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact6>, so she gets 0.5 * <fact5>40</fact5> = 20 large buttons. Since <fact1>a large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact1>, the rest of the large stickers are worth 3 small buttons each. So, the remaining 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. Lorraine also starts with <fact4>30 small stickers</fact4> and trades <fact7>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact7>, so she gets 0.9 * <fact4>30</fact4> = 27 large buttons. Since <fact3>a large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>, the remaining 3 small stickers are worth 3 / 3 = 1 large button, but since Lorraine can't trade the remaining small stickers for a large button, she will keep them as small buttons. Since <fact2>a small sticker is worth one small button</fact2>, she will get 3 small buttons. In total, Lorraine has 20 + 27 = 47 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons. The answer is {110}."

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Answer: The total cost of the picture frames is <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> * <fact4>$20</fact4> = $880. The additional cost for etching is $880 * <fact5>20%</fact5> = $880 * 0.2 = $176. The total cost for the picture frames is $880 + $176 = $1056. The cost of the pins is <fact2>2 seniors</fact2> * <fact3>$5</fact3> = $10. The number of officers is <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> * <fact6>1/4</fact6> = 11, and the cost of the cords is 11 * <fact7>$12</fact7> = $132. The total cost is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

How much profit does he make selling <fact8>10 jars</fact8>?

Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making 10 jars and subtract it from the total revenue. The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is <fact5>2 pounds</fact5> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact1>$6 per pound</fact1> = $120. The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is <fact6>1.5 pounds</fact6> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact2>$8 per pound</fact2> = $120. The cost of honey for 10 jars is <fact7>2 pounds</fact7> * <fact8>10 jars</fact8> * <fact3>$10 per pound</fact3> = $200. The total cost is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

During the <fact6>second week</fact6>, he made <fact7>300 kilometers every day</fact7>. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his <fact1>two-week-long trip</fact1>?

Answer: In the <fact2>first 4 days</fact2>, Tom traveled <fact3>200 kilometers every day</fact3>, so he traveled a total of <fact3>200</fact3> * 4 = 800 kilometers. Over the <fact4>next two days</fact4>, he traveled <fact5>30% of the distance traveled over the first four days</fact5>, which is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, in the first week, he traveled a total of 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers. In the <fact6>second week</fact6>, he made <fact7>300 kilometers every day</fact7>, so he traveled a total of <fact7>300</fact7> * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

The second class has <fact4>12 girls</fact4>. The school as a whole is <fact5>50% boys and 50% girls</fact5>. How many boys are in the third class?

Answer: Since the school is <fact5>50% boys and 50% girls</fact5> and there are <fact1>3 classes</fact1> with <fact2>20 students</fact2> each, the total number of students is <fact1>3</fact1> * <fact2>20</fact2> = 60. Half of these students are girls, so there are 60 / 2 = 30 girls in total. We know that the first class has <fact3>15 girls</fact3> and the second class has <fact4>12 girls</fact4>, so the third class must have 30 - <fact3>15</fact3> - <fact4>12</fact4> = 3 girls.

And Mei finds <fact3>half as many as Charlie</fact3>. Stacy finds <fact4>twice as many as Lamar</fact4>. Charlie finds <fact5>2 less than Stacy</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many eggs were hidden in total. Since <fact1>3 dozen eggs</fact1> were hidden, and 1 dozen equals 12, then 3 x 12 = 36 eggs were hidden. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Stacy finds <fact4>twice as many as Lamar</fact4>, so Stacy finds 2 x <fact2>5</fact2> = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <fact5>2 less than Stacy</fact5>, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds <fact3>half as many as Charlie</fact3>, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","Reformatted Question: Each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>. Each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>. Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3>. He wants to separate them into groups of <fact4>8</fact4> and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>?

Answer: Nik has <fact3>200 crayons</fact3> and each crayon weighs <fact1>1 ounce</fact1>, so the total weight of the crayons is <fact3>200</fact3> * <fact1>1</fact1> = 200 ounces. Since each box holds <fact4>8</fact4> crayons, Nik will need <fact3>200</fact3> / <fact4>8</fact4> = 25 boxes. Each box weighs <fact5>8 ounces</fact5>, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * <fact5>8</fact5> = 200 ounces. The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces. Since each pound is <fact2>16 ounces</fact2>, the total weight in pounds is 400 / <fact2>16</fact2> = 25 pounds. The answer is {25}."

How much did everything cost?,"Reformatted Question: Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee. He decides to buy <fact1>a week's worth of coffee</fact1> and he uses <fact2>1 pound of coffee per day</fact2>. The normal brand of coffee he buys cost <fact3>$5 per pound</fact3>.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost <fact4>20% more</fact4> since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for <fact5>$2</fact5>. How much did everything cost?

Answer: Roger needs <fact2>1 pound of coffee per day</fact2> for <fact1>a week's worth of coffee</fact1>, which is 7 days. So he needs 7 pounds of coffee. His normal brand of coffee costs <fact3>$5 per pound</fact3>, but the more expensive brand costs <fact4>20% more</fact4>, which is 5 + 5 * 0.2 = $6 per pound. So 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee will cost 7 * 6 = $42. Adding the cost of the donut, which is <fact5>$2</fact5>, the total cost is 42 + 2 = $44. The answer is {44}."
136,"Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. 11 students need size extra-small.  Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Twice as many students need size small as extra small.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","Reformatted Question: Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. <fact1>Four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>. <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>. <fact3>Half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>. <fact4>Six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>. <fact5>Twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>. Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?

Answer: Let's start by determining the number of students who need size small shirts. We know that <fact5>twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>, and <fact2>11 students need size extra-small</fact2>. Therefore, the number of students who need size small shirts is 2 x <fact2>11</fact2> = 22.

Next, we can determine the number of students who need size medium shirts. We know that <fact1>four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>, so the number of students who need size medium shirts is 22 - 4 = 18.

Now, we can determine the number of students who need size large shirts. We know that <fact3>half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>, so the number of students who need size large shirts is 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, we can determine the number of students who need size extra-large shirts. We know that <fact4>six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>, so the number of students who need size extra-large shirts is 9 + 6 = 15.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add the number of students who need each size: 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) + <fact2>11</fact2> (extra-small) = 75. The answer is {75}."

It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a <fact9>popcorn and box of candy that night</fact9>. How many movies can he see if every month his parents give him <fact10>$150 to spend at the movies</fact10>?

Answer: Colby has already spent <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact5>$10</fact5> = $50 on Friday and Saturday tickets and <fact2>8</fact2> * <fact6>$7</fact6> = $56 on other day tickets. He has also spent <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact7>$8</fact7> = $16 on popcorn and <fact4>4</fact4> * <fact8>$2</fact8> = $8 on candy. This month, he wants to buy <fact9>1 popcorn and 1 box of candy</fact9>, which will cost <fact7>$8</fact7> + <fact8>$2</fact8> = $10. So far, he has spent a total of $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130. He also wants to buy 1 more ticket for a Friday, which will cost <fact5>$10</fact5>. He has <fact10>$150</fact10> to spend each month. $150 - $130 - $10 - $10 = $0. This leaves him with no money left to spend on tickets for other days. Therefore, he can only see 1 more movie. The answer is {1}."

He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra <fact6>$3.00</fact6> which will add chips and a drink.   How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is <fact7>$6.50</fact7>?

Answer: First, calculate the total cost of the burrito. The base burrito costs <fact7>$6.50</fact7>. Adding extra meat costs <fact2>$2.00</fact2>, extra cheese costs <fact3>$1.00</fact3>, and avocado costs <fact4>$1.00</fact4>. The two sauces cost <fact5>$0.25 each</fact5>, so that's <fact5>$0.25</fact5> * 2 = $0.50. Upgrading the meal costs <fact6>$3.00</fact6>. So the total cost is <fact7>$6.50</fact7> + <fact2>$2.00</fact2> + <fact3>$1.00</fact3> + <fact4>$1.00</fact4> + $0.50 + <fact6>$3.00</fact6> = $14.00.

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Reformatted Question: Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses <fact1>the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and <fact2>the same amount of salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3>10-ounce jar</fact3> each time. She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Since <fact1>the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance</fact1>, the amount of fragrance is also x. Since <fact5>the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest</fact5>, the amount of salt is 2x. Since <fact2>the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar</fact2>, the amount of sugar is also 2x. Since <fact4>the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt</fact4>, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x. The total amount of the mixture is <fact3>10 ounces</fact3>, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, so x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. This simplifies to 10x = 10, so x = 1. Therefore, the amount of oil is 4x = 4 * 1 = 4 ounces. The answer is {4}."

The fee to rent the theater is <fact5>$125 for a party of 20</fact5>, plus <fact6>$6 for each additional guest</fact6>. How much will the party cost?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of guests. Kayla invited <fact1>25 classmates</fact1>, <fact2>7 girls in her dance class</fact2>, and <fact3>13 family members</fact3>, for a total of <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 45 guests. However, <fact4>4 people said they could not come</fact4>, so the actual number of guests is 45 - <fact4>4</fact4> = 41. The fee to rent the theater is <fact5>$125 for a party of 20</fact5>, and since there are 41 guests, there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. The cost for these additional guests is <fact6>$6 for each additional guest</fact6> * 21 = $126. Therefore, the total cost of the party is <fact5>$125</fact5> + $126 = $251. The answer is {251}."

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Answer: The cost of the <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> was <fact2>10</fact2> * <fact3>$10</fact3> = $100. The cost of the <fact4>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact4> was <fact4>5</fact4> * <fact5>$16</fact5> = $80. So the total cost of the leftover lumber was $100 + $80 = $180. The selling price of the <fact2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact2> is <fact2>10</fact2> * <fact3>$10</fact3> * (1 + <fact1>50%</fact1>) = $150.

How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Since <fact2>20 plants</fact2> - <fact3>4 plants</fact3> = 16 plants, and we know that <fact1>8 plants need 1 cup of water</fact1>, this means that 16 plants need 2 cups of water. But these 16 plants need only <fact4>a quarter of a cup of water</fact4>, so they need 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 cups of water. The other <fact3>4 plants need half of a cup of water</fact3>, so they need 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water. Therefore, Crista needs 0.5 + 2 = 2.5 cups of water every day for her plants.

In one month, Marcel sold a total of <fact1>300 bikes</fact1> among the types listed. <fact2>Half of them were Trekking bikes</fact2>, and <fact3>15% were BMX bikes</fact3>. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. The <fact4>price of one MTB is $500</fact4>, <fact5>BMX is half the price of an MTB</fact5>, and <fact6>a Trekking bike is $450</fact6>. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bikes of each type Marcel sold. We know that <fact2>half of the bikes were Trekking bikes</fact2>, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is <fact1>300</fact1> / 2 = 150. We also know that <fact3>15% of the bikes were BMX bikes</fact3>, so the number of BMX bikes sold is <fact1>300</fact1> * 0.15 = 45. The rest of the bikes were MTB type, so the number of MTB bikes sold is <fact1>300</fact1> - 150 - 45 = 105. Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Marcel earned from selling each type of bike. The total amount earned from selling MTB bikes is 105 * <fact4>$500</fact4> = $52,500. The total amount earned from selling BMX bikes is 45 * (<fact4>$500</fact4> / 2) = 45 * <fact5>$250</fact5> = $11,250. The total amount earned from selling Trekking bikes is 150 * <fact6>$450</fact6> = $67,500. Finally, we can add up the amounts earned from selling each type of bike to find the total amount Marcel earned: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250. The answer is {131250}."

Therefore, the price of one crate of fruit is <fact1>5 bananas</fact1> * $1 + <fact2>12 apples</fact2> * $0.5 + <fact3>7 oranges</fact3> * $3 = $5 + $6 + $21 = $32. The answer is {32}."

The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released <fact7>half of the yellow balloons</fact7>. What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

Answer: Sally started with <fact3>25 red balloons</fact3> but lost <fact6>40% of the red balloons</fact6>, so she had <fact3>25</fact3> - <fact3>25</fact3> * <fact6>0.4</fact6> = 15 red balloons left. She also started with <fact5>12 yellow balloons</fact5> but lost <fact7>half of the yellow balloons</fact7>, so she had <fact5>12</fact5> - <fact5>12</fact5> / 2 = 6 yellow balloons left. The number of green balloons didn't change, so she still had <fact4>7 green balloons</fact4>. She found <fact1>8 blue balloons</fact1> and took <fact2>75% of them</fact2>, so she had <fact1>8</fact1> * <fact2>0.75</fact2> = 6 blue balloons.

157,"There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>6 periods in the day</fact1> for a normal student. Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>. He then spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact5>2 extra classes a day</fact5>?

Answer: John has <fact1>6 periods</fact1> + <fact5>2 extra classes</fact5> = 8 classes per day. Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>, so he spends 8 x <fact2>40 minutes</fact2> = 320 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, so he spends 320 x <fact3>5</fact3> = 1600 minutes per week in class. He also spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. His weekly minutes are 1600 minutes (from class) + 2 x <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> (from Saturday and Sunday). Let x be his weekly minutes. Then x = 1600 + 2 x <fact4>1/16</fact4> x x. Solving for x, we get x = 1600 / (1 - 2 x <fact4>1/16</fact4>) = 1600 / (1 - 1/8) = 1600 / (7/8) = 1600 x (8/7) = 1828.57 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 1828.57 / 60 = 30.48 hours. The answer is {30.48}."

Answer: Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as x. On the first day, they used <fact5>38 bandages</fact5> and ordered <fact6>one bulk pack of bandages</fact6> which is <fact1>50 bandages</fact1>, so they had x - <fact5>38</fact5> + <fact1>50</fact1> bandages left. On the second day, they used <fact5>38</fact5> - <fact4>10</fact4> = 28 bandages, so they had x - <fact5>38</fact5> + <fact1>50</fact1> - 28 bandages left.

So, at the end of the third day, they had x - <fact5>38</fact5> + <fact1>50</fact1> - 28 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left. Since they had <fact7>78 bandages left</fact7> at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation x + 59 = <fact7>78</fact7> and solve for x. x = <fact7>78</fact7> - 59 = 19.

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","Reformatted Question: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives <fact1>2 miles away from the school</fact1>. Steve lives <fact2>3 miles from the school</fact2> and can bike at <fact3>440 feet per minute</fact3>. If Tim can ride his skateboard at <fact4>264 feet per minute</fact4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, Tim lives <fact1>2 miles</fact1> * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet away from school, and Steve lives <fact2>3 miles</fact2> * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet away from school. Now we can calculate the time it takes each of them to get home. Tim will take 10560 feet / <fact4>264 feet per minute</fact4> = 40 minutes to get home, and Steve will take 15840 feet / <fact3>440 feet per minute</fact3> = 36 minutes to get home. Since Steve is the winner, he will be waiting 40 - 36 = 4 minutes for Tim to finish. The answer is {4}."

If <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, how many rats are in each cage?

Answer: The total number of straws given to the hamsters is <fact1>10 cages</fact1> * <fact2>5 pieces of straw</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw. The rabbits receive <fact5>20 pieces of straw</fact5>. So the total number of straws given to the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw. Since <fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, the rats must have received 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw. Since each rat receives <fact4>6 pieces of straw</fact4>, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

There will be <fact4>30 kids</fact4> and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have <fact5>4 jello cups</fact5>. How much will he spend on jello?

Answer: To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate how many boxes of jello he needs to buy. Since there will be <fact4>30 kids</fact4> and each kid will have <fact5>4 jello cups</fact5>, the total number of jello cups needed is <fact4>30</fact4> x <fact5>4</fact5> = 120.

Answer: Since Lucy got <fact4>$56 from selling the apples picked on Monday</fact4> and each apple is sold at <fact1>$4 per piece</fact1>, she must have picked 56/<fact1>4</fact1> = 14 apples on Monday.

Answer: Mary originally had <fact3>2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges</fact3> = 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. She then received <fact1>18 new potted plants</fact1>, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

What percent of the plants are <fact4>flowering plants</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of <fact2>indoor plants</fact2>. Since <fact5>one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</fact5>, we can calculate the number of indoor plants as <fact1>100</fact1> * 1/4 = 25. Now, we need to find the number of plants that are not indoor plants, which is <fact1>100</fact1> - 25 = 75. Among these 75 plants, <fact3>two-thirds of them are outdoor plants</fact3>, so the number of outdoor plants is 75 * 2/3 = 50. This means that the number of <fact4>flowering plants</fact4> is 75 - 50 = 25. To find the percentage of flowering plants, we can divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / <fact1>100</fact1>) * 100 = 25%. The answer is {25}."

They will install additional items for an extra <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9>. How much will this cost her?

Answer: Angela has <fact1>6 mirrors</fact1> but the installation package only includes hanging <fact5>4 mirrors</fact5>, so she will need to pay extra for 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. She also has <fact2>2 chandeliers</fact2> but the package only includes hanging <fact7>1 chandelier</fact7>, so she will need to pay extra for 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The package includes hanging <fact8>10 pictures</fact8> but Angela has <fact3>20 pictures</fact3>, so she will need to pay extra for 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. In total, Angela will need to pay extra for 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items. At <fact9>$15.00 per item</fact9>, this will cost her 13 x 15 = $195.

He has a fish tank with <fact5>three times the number of fish as rabbits</fact5>. How many pets does Larry have?

Answer: Larry has <fact1>3 cats</fact1>. He has <fact2>3 times as many dogs as cats</fact2>, so he has <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact1>3</fact1> = 9 dogs. He has <fact3>2 fewer rabbits than dogs</fact3>, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. He has a fish tank with <fact5>three times the number of fish as rabbits</fact5>, so he has <fact5>3</fact5> * 7 = 21 fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's <fact4>1/3 the number of fish he has</fact4>, so he has 21 / <fact4>3</fact4> = 7 gerbils. Therefore, Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.

Of the people who receive interviews, <fact3>20% receive a job offer</fact3>. How many people accept the position?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many people received interviews. Since there were 100 applicants and <fact1>30% receive interviews</fact1>, the number of people who received interviews is 100 * 0.3 = 30. Next, we need to find out how many people received a job offer. Since <fact3>20% receive a job offer</fact3> out of the people who received interviews, the number of people who received a job offer is 30 * 0.2 = 6. Finally, we need to find out how many people accepted the position.

What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?

Answer: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at <fact3>75% of its original price</fact3>, which is <fact3>75%</fact3> * <fact2>$2000</fact2> = $1500. He then sold it to his friend at <fact1>120% of the price that he bought it</fact1>, which is <fact1>120%</fact1> * $1500 = $1800.

How long did it take him to get across the lake?","Reformatted Question: James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>. He swims <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2>. He can swim at a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>. He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5>half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer: First, we need to find out how far James swam at his initial pace. Since he swam <fact2>60% of the distance</fact2> of the <fact1>20-mile lake</fact1>, he swam 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>, this took him 12 / 2 = 6 hours. After this, he rested for <fact4>half as long as the swimming time</fact4>, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. Now, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. Since he is going at <fact5>half the speed</fact5> of his initial pace of <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3>, he is now swimming at 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, it will take him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. In total, it took James 6 hours to swim the first part, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to swim the second part. So, it took him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake. The answer is {17}."

However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Reformatted Question: Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a <fact1>flat fee of $200</fact1>, regardless of how many guests attend. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges <fact2>$25 per person</fact2> who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost <fact3>$5 for each person</fact3> who attends. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Answer: Let's denote the number of guests as x. The cost of the first venue is the flat fee plus the cost of food for each guest, which is <fact1>$200</fact1> + <fact3>$5</fact3>x. The cost of the second venue is the charge per person times the number of guests, which is <fact2>$25</fact2>x. To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for x: 200 + 5x = 25x. Subtracting 5x from both sides gives 200 = 20x. Dividing both sides by 20 gives x = 10. The answer is {10}."

In the <fact3>first of three sets</fact3>, he had to retrieve <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the <fact3>first set of the match</fact3>?

Answer: Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Then, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is <fact1>half as many balls as in the second</fact1>, which is x/2. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is <fact4>four more balls than in the second set</fact4>, which is x + 4. The total number of balls retrieved is <fact2>19 tennis balls in all</fact2>, so we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x + 8 = 38. This simplifies to 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5 gives x = 6. So, the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10. The answer is {10}."

Since only <fact1>8 students can try the escape room at a time</fact1>, the students will need to be divided into groups of <fact1>8</fact1>. 40 / <fact1>8</fact1> = 5, so there will be 5 groups of students trying the escape room. Each group will use their full <fact2>45 minutes</fact2> to try and escape. Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 x <fact2>45 minutes</fact2> = 225 minutes. The answer is {225}."

Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  After 2 months, Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?","Reformatted Question: When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of <fact1>$10 per hour</fact1>. Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is <fact2>$0.50 more per hour</fact2> than Billy's starting salary was. After <fact3>2 months</fact3>, Billy was given a raise of <fact4>$0.50 per hour</fact4>. On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of <fact5>$1.00 per hour</fact5>. If both Billy and Sally work <fact6>20 hours</fact6>, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?

Answer: Sally earns <fact1>$10</fact1> + <fact2>$0.50</fact2> = $10.50 per hour. Billy was given two raises, so he earns <fact1>$10</fact1> + <fact4>$0.50</fact4> + <fact5>$1.00</fact5> = $11.50 per hour. If they both work <fact6>20 hours</fact6>, Sally will earn $10.50 * <fact6>20</fact6> = $210 and Billy will earn $11.50 * <fact6>20</fact6> = $230. Therefore, Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally. The answer is {20}."
215,"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","Reformatted Question: Carlos is planting a lemon tree. Each year it will grow <fact1>7 lemons</fact1>, which he can sell for <fact2>$1.5 each</fact2>. It costs <fact3>$3 a year</fact3> to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost <fact4>$90 to plant</fact4>. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

Answer: To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate how much money he earns per year from selling lemons and subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree. Carlos earns <fact1>7 lemons</fact1> * <fact2>$1.5 per lemon</fact2> = $10.5 per year from selling lemons. After subtracting the cost of watering and feeding the tree, <fact3>$3 per year</fact3>, he earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year. To find the break-even point, we need to divide the cost of planting the tree, <fact4>$90</fact4>, by the annual earnings, $7.5. $90 / $7.5 = 12 years. The answer is {12}."

They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"Reformatted Question: Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs <fact1>$11</fact1>. They also bought <fact2>1 dozen balloons</fact2> which were sold for <fact3>$0.5 for 2 balloons</fact3>. The remaining money was used to buy <fact4>2 tubs of ice cream</fact4> for <fact5>$7 each</fact5>. The two girls were given the <fact6>same amount of allowance</fact6> by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Answer: The cost of the balloons is <fact2>1 dozen balloons</fact2> / 2 * <fact3>$0.5 for 2 balloons</fact3> = $3. The cost of the ice cream is <fact4>2 tubs of ice cream</fact4> * <fact5>$7 each</fact5> = $14. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is <fact1>$11</fact1> + $3 + $14 = $28. Since the two girls were given the <fact6>same amount of allowance</fact6>, the total allowance is 2x. The total allowance equals the total cost, so 2x = $28. Solving for x, x = $28 / 2 = $14. The answer is {14}."
217,"Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?","Reformatted Question: Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The <fact1>jacket she wants costs $30</fact1> and <fact2>each pair of shoes cost $20</fact2>. Her parents pay her <fact3>$4 each time she mows the lawn</fact3>. Sara <fact4>babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them</fact4>. If Sara <fact5>already had $10 saved before she started babysitting</fact5>, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Answer: The jacket costs <fact1>$30</fact1> and the shoes cost 2 x <fact2>$20</fact2> = $40. So the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70. Sara earns <fact4>$5 each time she babysits</fact4> and she <fact4>babysits 4 times</fact4>, so she earns 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting. Adding this to the <fact5>$10 she already had</fact5>, she now has a total of $20 + $10 = $30. So she still needs $70 - $30 = $40. Since she earns <fact3>$4 each time she mows the lawn</fact3>, she will need to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times. The answer is {10}."

221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"Reformatted Question: Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps on the track in one hour</fact1>. Quinn can run <fact2>2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</fact2>. Shaelyn can run <fact3>half as many laps as Trey</fact3>. Trey can run <fact4>4 more laps than Bethany</fact4>. How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many laps Trey can run. Since Trey can run <fact4>4 more laps than Bethany</fact4> and Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps</fact1>, Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. Then, we find out how many laps Shaelyn can run. Since Shaelyn can run <fact3>half as many laps as Trey</fact3> and Trey can run 14 laps, Shaelyn can run 14/2 = 7 laps. Now, we find out how many laps Quinn can run. Since Quinn can run <fact2>2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</fact2> and Shaelyn can run 7 laps, Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps. Finally, we compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps. Bethany can run <fact1>10 laps</fact1> and Quinn can run 5 laps, so Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. The answer is {5}."
222,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"Reformatted Question: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. A <fact1>2 x 4 costs $4</fact1>. A <fact2>2 x 8 costs $6</fact2>.  He can get <fact3>200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood</fact3> and <fact4>400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood</fact4>. He has <fact5>$24 to buy wood for sticks</fact5>. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer: To determine the cheapest lumber, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood. For the 2 x 4, the cost per stick is <fact1>$4</fact1> / <fact3>200 sticks</fact3> = $0.02 per stick. For the 2 x 8, the cost per stick is <fact2>$6</fact2> / <fact4>400 sticks</fact4> = $0.015 per stick. Since the 2 x 8 has a lower cost per stick, it is the cheapest lumber. With <fact5>$24</fact5>, Frederick can buy <fact5>$24</fact5> / <fact2>$6</fact2> = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. This will give him 4 x <fact4>400 sticks</fact4> = 1600 sticks. The answer is {1600}."

Sydney's has <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> she spits each one <fact4>12 feet</fact4>. What is the average total distance spat?

Answer: To find the average total distance spat, we need to first find the total distance spat by each person. Zoey spits <fact1>40 seeds</fact1> * <fact2>10 feet</fact2> = 400 feet. Sydney spits <fact3>35 seeds</fact3> * <fact4>12 feet</fact4> = 420 feet. The total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet. Since there are 2 people, the average total distance spat is 820 / 2 = 410 feet. The answer is {410}."

If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reformatted Question: Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is <fact1>33 degrees</fact1>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours <fact2>4 ounces of water</fact2> from the <fact1>33-degree mug</fact1> into his water bottle and <fact3>one ounce from the other bottle</fact3>, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least <fact4>40 degrees</fact4>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Answer: Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x. When Donny pours <fact2>4 ounces of water</fact2> from the <fact1>33-degree mug</fact1> and <fact3>one ounce from the other bottle</fact3>, the total amount of water becomes 4 + 1 = 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixed water should be at least <fact4>40 degrees</fact4> for Donny to drink it. We can set up an equation using the concept of weighted averages: (4 * <fact1>33</fact1> + 1 * x) / 5 >= <fact4>40</fact4>. Solving for x, we get: 132 + x >= 200, x >= 68. The answer is {68}."
226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"Reformatted Question: Gary bought a boat for <fact1>$9000</fact1>. Over the <fact2>third year it depreciated 20%</fact2>. Over the <fact3>first year it depreciated 30%</fact3>. The <fact4>second year it depreciated another 30%</fact4>. How much is the boat worth after the three years?

Answer: To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. The boat depreciated by <fact3>30%</fact3> in the first year, so its value after the first year is <fact1>$9000</fact1> - (<fact1>$9000</fact1> * <fact3>0.30</fact3>) = $9000 - $2700 = $6300. In the second year, it depreciated by <fact4>30%</fact4>, so its value after the second year is $6300 - ($6300 * <fact4>0.30</fact4>) = $6300 - $1890 = $4410. In the third year, it depreciated by <fact2>20%</fact2>, so its value after the third year is $4410 - ($4410 * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = $4410 - $882 = $3528. The answer is {3528}."

She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?","Reformatted Question: Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from <fact1>2:15 to 2:38 am</fact1>. Also, that day she woke up <fact2>5 minutes earlier than usual</fact2> to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at <fact3>10 p.m.</fact3> and wakes up at <fact4>6 a.m.</fact4>. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total time Kim usually sleeps. She sleeps from <fact3>10 p.m.</fact3> to <fact4>6 a.m.</fact4>, which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps 8 x 60 = 480 minutes. However, on this particular day, she woke up <fact2>5 minutes earlier than usual</fact2>, so she slept 480 - 5 = 475 minutes. Additionally, she was sleepwalking from <fact1>2:15 to 2:38 am</fact1>, which is 23 minutes. Therefore, she was not sleeping on her bed during those 23 minutes. So, we need to subtract those 23 minutes from her total sleep time. 475 - 23 = 452 minutes. The answer is {452}."
