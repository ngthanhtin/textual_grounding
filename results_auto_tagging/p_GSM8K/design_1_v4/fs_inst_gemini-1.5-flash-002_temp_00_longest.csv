She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","**Reformatted Question:**

At an auction, Carmen bids on an antique desk.  The opening bid is `$200`. Each subsequent bid increases by `$50`. Three other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the three other people and wins the auction. How much money does the desk cost Carmen?


**Answer:**

The opening bid is `$200`.  Since three other people bid once each, and Carmen bids after each of them, the bids increase by `$50` three times.  Therefore, the final bid price is $200 + ($50 * 3) = $350.  Carmen wins the auction, so the desk costs her `$350`.

1,"Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","**Reformatted Question:**

Steve receives a game console and [5 initial games] for his birthday.  For the next three years, he buys [4 games/month for the first year], receives [5 games for Christmas each year], saves up to buy [1 game/month for the second year], and then [2 games/month for the third year]. How many games does Steve have after 3 years?


**Answer:**

Let's break down Steve's game acquisition year by year:

* **Year 1:** Steve starts with 5 initial games. He buys 4 games/month * 12 months/year = 48 games. He also receives 5 Christmas games.  Total for Year 1: 5 + 48 + 5 = 58 games.

* **Year 2:** Steve buys 1 game/month * 12 months/year = 12 games. He also receives 5 Christmas games. Total for Year 2: 12 + 5 = 17 games *added* to his collection.

* **Year 3:** Steve buys 2 games/month * 12 months/year = 24 games. He also receives 5 Christmas games. Total for Year 3: 24 + 5 = 29 games *added* to his collection.

To find the total number of games after 3 years, we add up the games from each year: 58 (Year 1) + 17 (Year 2) + 29 (Year 3) = 104 games.

Therefore, Steve has a total of 104 games after 3 years.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","**Reformatted Question:**

Billy is preparing potatoes for a potato salad.  [Number of Potatoes]: He has 60 potatoes. [Peeling Time]: It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. [Cutting Time]: It takes him 5 seconds to cut a potato.  [Potato Size]: Potatoes are roughly the same size. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?


**Answer:**

To determine how long it will take Billy to prep all the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and the total time for cutting, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the peeling time.  Billy has 60 potatoes and it takes him 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel each one.  Therefore, the total peeling time is 60 potatoes * 90 seconds/potato = 5400 seconds.

Next, let's calculate the cutting time. It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut each potato, and he has 60 potatoes.  So the total cutting time is 60 potatoes * 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds.

Finally, we add the peeling and cutting times together: 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"**Reformatted Question:**

James gets [Number of CDs: 10] new CDs. He decides he doesn't like [Number of CDs sold: 5] of them and sells them for [Selling Price: $40]. Each CD cost [Original Price per CD: $15]. He gets them for [Discount Percentage: 40%] off. How much money was he out?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the original cost of the 10 CDs before the discount.  Each CD cost [Original Price per CD: $15], so the total original cost would have been 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150.

Next, we need to account for the discount.  James received a [Discount Percentage: 40%] discount, meaning he paid only 60% of the original price.  His actual cost was $150 * 0.60 = $90.

Now, let's consider the CDs he sold. He sold [Number of CDs sold: 5] CDs for [Selling Price: $40].

To determine how much money James was out, we subtract his revenue from his cost:  $90 (cost of all CDs) - $40 (revenue from selling CDs) = $50.

Therefore, James was out $50.

4,There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?,"**Reformatted Question:**

A school auditorium has 4 rows of seats, with 18 seats in each row.  [Number of seats per row]: 18, [Number of rows]: 4. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. [Administrator occupancy fraction]: 1/4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. [Parent occupancy fraction (of remaining seats)]: 1/3. The rest of the seats were occupied by students. How many students were there in the school auditorium?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the total number of seats in the auditorium.  The auditorium has [Number of rows]: 4 rows with [Number of seats per row]: 18 seats per row, so there are 4 * 18 = 72 total seats.

Next, let's determine the number of seats occupied by administrators.  [Administrator occupancy fraction]: 1/4 of the 72 seats were occupied by administrators, which is (1/4) * 72 = 18 seats.

Now, let's find the number of remaining seats after the administrators were seated.  There were 72 total seats - 18 seats occupied by administrators = 54 remaining seats.

Then, let's calculate the number of seats occupied by parents. [Parent occupancy fraction (of remaining seats)]: 1/3 of the remaining 54 seats were occupied by parents, which is (1/3) * 54 = 18 seats.

Finally, to find the number of students, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents from the total number of seats.  There were 72 total seats - 18 seats (administrators) - 18 seats (parents) = 36 seats occupied by students.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

5,"A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?","**Reformatted Question:**

A bag of glass chips contains [number_of_chips_per_bag: 72] chips. Milo is making a mosaic that is [height_of_mosaic: 3] inches tall.  It takes [chips_per_square_inch: 12] glass chips to make one square inch of the mosaic.  If Milo has [number_of_bags: 2] bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?


**Answer:**

Milo has [number_of_bags: 2] bags of glass chips, and each bag contains [number_of_chips_per_bag: 72] chips.  Therefore, he has a total of 2 * [number_of_chips_per_bag: 72] = 144 glass chips.

The mosaic is [height_of_mosaic: 3] inches tall.  The area of the mosaic is the length multiplied by the height.  We know that it takes [chips_per_square_inch: 12] chips to make one square inch of the mosaic.

Let's denote the length of the mosaic as 'L' inches.  The area of the mosaic is then 3L square inches.  The total number of chips needed is the area multiplied by the number of chips per square inch: 3L * [chips_per_square_inch: 12] = 36L.

Since Milo has 144 chips, we can set up the equation: 36L = 144.  Solving for L, we get L = 144 / 36 = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.  The answer is {4}.

6,"Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?","**Reformatted Question:**

Bernie has 4 dogs.  [Dog 1 needs 1 mile of walking]. [Average daily walk is 3 miles per dog]. [Dog 2 needs 4 miles of walking]. [Dog 3 needs 3 miles of walking]. How many miles does the last dog need?


**Answer:**

The problem states that Bernie has 4 dogs and that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day.  This means the total daily walking distance for all four dogs is 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

We know the walking requirements for three of the dogs:

* Dog 1: 1 mile
* Dog 2: 4 miles
* Dog 3: 3 miles

The total miles walked by these three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total daily walking requirement:

12 miles (total) - 8 miles (dogs 1, 2, and 3) = 4 miles.

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

A perfume company sells [vanilla scents] and [fruity scents].  By the end of the day, they sell [5 of each vanilla scent] and [2 of each fruity scent]. They have [4 vanilla scents] and [8 fruity scents] available. How many more [vanilla scents] sold compared with [fruity scents]?


**Answer:**

The question asks for the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents.  The company sold 5 of each vanilla scent, and they had 4 vanilla scents available. This means they sold a total of 5 vanilla scents * 4 vanilla scents = 20 vanilla scents.  They sold 2 of each fruity scent, and they had 8 fruity scents available. This means they sold a total of 2 fruity scents * 8 fruity scents = 16 fruity scents.  Therefore, the difference in sales is 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more vanilla scents sold than fruity scents.  The answer is {4}.

Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?","**Reformatted Question:**

Ron's car will incur [$450] damage from a pothole if left unfixed.  He can fix it himself using [3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each], but faces a [$120] fine for unauthorized road work. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole himself?


**Answer:**

If Ron leaves the pothole unfixed, he will incur [$450] in car damage.  The cost of fixing the pothole himself is [3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75] plus the [$120] fine, totaling $75 + $120 = $195.  By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $450 (cost of car damage) - $195 (cost of self-repair) = $255. Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

9,"Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","**Reformatted Question:**

Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom [bedroom dimensions]: 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor [contractor charges for removal]: charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and [contractor charges for installation]: $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet [carpet cost]: he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus [padding cost]: $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom:

* Area = length × width = 18 feet × 12 feet = 216 square feet

Next, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

* Removal cost = Area × cost per square foot = 216 square feet × $4/square foot = $864

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

* Carpet cost per square foot = $12/square foot + $2/square foot = $14/square foot
* Total carpet and padding cost = Area × cost per square foot = 216 square feet × $14/square foot = $3024

Finally, let's calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

* Installation cost = Area × cost per square foot = 216 square feet × $34/square foot = $7344

To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we add up all the costs:

* Total cost = Removal cost + Total carpet and padding cost + Installation cost = $864 + $3024 + $7344 = $11232

Therefore, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.

10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","**Reformatted Question:**

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and *an unknown number of apples* from the average trees.  Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees.  She doesn't take any from the average trees.  The sisters gathered a combined total of 500 apples. How many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the apple gathering:

* **Joanne's Tallest Trees:** Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Joanne's Shortest Trees:** Joanne gathered half the amount from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
* **Joanne's Average Trees:** Let's represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as ""x"".
* **Sister's Tallest Trees:** Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** Joanne's sister gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
* **Sister's Average Trees:** Joanne's sister gathered 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered is 500.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:

30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500

Combining like terms, we get:

150 + x = 500

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we find:

x = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The answer is {350}.

11,"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","**Reformatted Question:**

Pat has a flower bed that is [flower_bed_length: 111 feet] long. Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Pat already owns [existing_flowers: 17] flowers. Pat's flowers grow [flower_width: 12 inches] wide, so she needs to leave [spacing: 1.5 feet] between every plant. Each flowering plant costs [plant_cost: $6] at the store. How much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed.  Pat's flowers are [flower_width: 12 inches] wide, which is equal to 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot.  Therefore, each plant, including the spacing, requires 1 foot + [spacing: 1.5 feet] = 2.5 feet of space.

Next, we calculate how many plants can fit in the [flower_bed_length: 111-foot] long flower bed.  We divide the total length by the space required per plant: 111 feet / 2.5 feet/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants.

Pat already owns [existing_flowers: 17] flowers, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each plant costs [plant_cost: $6], so Pat will spend 27 plants * $6/plant = $162 at the store.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?,"**Reformatted Question:**

John spent 40% of his vacation time sightseeing.  He spent 30% of his time on other activities including 6 hours boating, half that time swimming (3 hours), and watching 3 shows at 2 hours each (6 hours). How much time did John spend sightseeing?


**Answer:**

The question states that John spent 30% of his vacation time on activities other than sightseeing.  These activities included boating (6 hours), swimming (3 hours), and watching shows (6 hours).  In total, these activities took 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his vacation time equals 15 hours, we can calculate the total vacation time as follows:

15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours

John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

15,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","**Reformatted Question:**

A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk.  He recycles chalk smaller than 2 inches. He aims to use 20% of the chalk daily, but on Monday used 45%.  How many days will the chalk last *after* Monday, using only 20% per day?


**Answer:**

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch piece of chalk.  This means he used 0.45 * 5 inches = 2.25 inches of chalk.

The remaining length of the chalk is 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

The teacher recycles chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.  He now aims to use only 20% of the chalk each day.

Let's calculate how much chalk remains after each day:

* **Day 1 (Tuesday):** 2.75 inches * 0.20 = 0.55 inches used. Remaining: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches.
* **Day 2 (Wednesday):** 2.2 inches * 0.20 = 0.44 inches used. Remaining: 2.2 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches.

Since the remaining chalk (1.76 inches) is already less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after **two** more days (Tuesday and Wednesday).  Therefore, he has 2 days before he needs to recycle the chalk.

17,"Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","**Reformatted Question:**

Blake and Kelly are having a running contest for 15 minutes on a 100-yard football field.  [Kelly's first run]: Kelly runs the length of the field once. [Kelly's subsequent runs]: She then runs from the goal line to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. [Blake's runs]: Blake runs the length of the field back and forth 15 times.  How much farther does the winner run than the loser?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Kelly's total distance.  Her first run ([Kelly's first run]) covers 100 yards.  Her subsequent runs ([Kelly's subsequent runs]) consist of 34 repetitions of a 40-yard run and back, which is 80 yards per repetition.  So, her subsequent runs total 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.  Therefore, Kelly's total distance is 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Next, let's calculate Blake's total distance.  He runs the length of the field back and forth 15 times ([Blake's runs]), meaning he runs 100 yards 30 times (15 back-and-forths * 2 directions).  So, Blake's total distance is 30 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Comparing their distances, Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2820 yards.  Therefore, Blake ran farther than Kelly. The difference is 3000 - 2820 = 180 yards.

Therefore, the winner (Blake) ran 180 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

**Answer:** {180}

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats: [1 cookie/day] * [7 days/week] = 7 cookies per week.

Next, let's calculate how many cookies go into her son's lunchbox: [4 cookies/day] * [5 days/week] = 20 cookies per week.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's husband and son: 7 cookies + 20 cookies = 27 cookies.

Finally, let's subtract the cookies eaten by Jenny's husband and son from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many Jenny eats: [36 cookies] - 27 cookies = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

The north and south walls [north/south wall dimensions] are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls [east/west wall dimensions] are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost [total cost] to paint the room?


**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls to be painted.

* **North and South Walls:** Each of these walls has an area of 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, their combined area is 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.
* **East and West Walls:** Each of these walls has an area of 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, their combined area is 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.
* **Total Area:** The total area to be painted is 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Next, we determine how many gallons of paint are needed.  Since one gallon covers 20 square feet [area per gallon], Tony will need 240 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each gallon costs $12 [paint cost], so 12 gallons will cost 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

Therefore, it will cost Tony $144 to paint the room.

20,"On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?","**Reformatted Question:**

On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with [initial_guests:100] guests. [early_checkout:24] guests elected an early checkout and [late_checkout:15] elected for a late checkout. [additional_checkin:7] more people checked in after dinner was served. In the afternoon, [afternoon_checkin] twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?


**Answer:**

To determine the number of guests after dinner, we need to account for the initial number of guests, those who checked out early, those who checked out late, and those who checked in after dinner.

1. **Start with the initial number of guests:** The hotel began with [initial_guests:100] guests.

2. **Subtract early checkouts:**  [early_checkout:24] guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

3. **Subtract late checkouts:** This step is irrelevant because the late checkouts happened *after* dinner.

4. **Add afternoon check-ins:** Twice as many people checked in during the afternoon as those who opted for a late checkout ([late_checkout:15]).  This means 15 * 2 = 30 additional guests checked in during the afternoon.  The total number of guests before dinner is now 76 + 30 = 106 guests.

5. **Add post-dinner check-ins:** Finally, [additional_checkin:7] more people checked in after dinner.

6. **Final count:** Therefore, the total number of guests after dinner is 106 + 7 = 113 guests.

The answer is {113}.

Brendan [starts with] a bag of [10 marbles]. He [drops half], [picks up 3], one of which is a [bead], and discards it. How many [marbles] did Brendan end up with?


**Answer:**

Brendan initially had 10 marbles.  He dropped half, meaning he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.  After the drop, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles remaining. He picked up 3 items, but one was a bead, not a marble. Therefore, he only recovered 3 - 1 = 2 marbles.  In total, he ended up with 5 (marbles remaining after the drop) + 2 (marbles picked up) = 7 marbles.

22,"Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","**Reformatted Question:**

[Weight Loss Goal] Andy wants to lose 30 lbs by his birthday, July 19th (from December 31st).  [Calorie Deficit] It takes 3500 calories burned to lose one pound.  [Daily Deficit Calculation] How many calories does he need to have as a daily deficit to reach his goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight.  His birthday is July 19th, and today is December 31st.  Counting the days from December 31st to July 19th gives us a total of 200 days ([Timeframe]).

Next, we calculate the total calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs.  Since it takes 3500 calories to lose one pound ([Calorie Deficit]), he needs a total deficit of 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105000 calories ([Total Calorie Deficit]).

Finally, to find the required daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days he has to achieve it: 105000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day ([Daily Deficit Calculation]).

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by his birthday.  The answer is {525}.

He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?","**Reformatted Question:**

Artie sells marigolds for [$2.74] per pot, petunias for [$1.87] per pot, and begonias for [$2.12] per pot.  He rounds prices to the nearest dollar.  If Artie sells [12 pots of marigolds], [9 pots of petunias], and [17 pots of begonias], how much will he make?


**Answer:**

Artie rounds his prices to the nearest dollar. Therefore:

* **Marigolds:**  $2.74 rounds up to $3 per pot.  Selling 12 pots of marigolds will earn him 12 * $3 = $36.
* **Petunias:** $1.87 rounds up to $2 per pot. Selling 9 pots of petunias will earn him 9 * $2 = $18.
* **Begonias:** $2.12 rounds up to $2 per pot. Selling 17 pots of begonias will earn him 17 * $2 = $34.

His total earnings will be $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

Therefore, Artie will make $88.

Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?","**Reformatted Question:**

Given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey?


**Answer:**

The problem states that Jason carried 2 balls.  Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 balls * 2 = 4 balls.  Because Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 balls / 2 = 1 ball.

Therefore, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 balls (Jason) + 4 balls (Jordan) + 1 ball (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.  The question states that ""the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip,"" so the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

Mack counted birds each day for a week.  [Day 1 & 2]: He saw a total of 50 birds. [Day 3]: He saw 0 birds. [Days 4 & 5]: He saw 120 birds. [Day 6]: He saw 20 birds. [Day 7]: He saw 90 birds.  What is the average number of birds Mack saw per day?


**Answer:**

To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to determine the total number of birds seen over the week and then divide by the number of days.

* **Days 1 & 2:** Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
* **Day 3:** Mack saw 0 birds.
* **Days 4 & 5:** Mack saw a total of 120 birds.
* **Day 6:** Mack saw 20 birds.
* **Day 7:** Mack saw 90 birds.

The total number of birds seen over the seven days is 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds/day.

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.

**Answer:**

First, let's determine how many problems Chris completed on Tuesday.  The question states that he completed ""3 times as many problems as he did on Monday,"" and he did 12 problems on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

Next, let's find the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday.  This is the sum of Monday's and Tuesday's work: 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, let's calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday.  Chris started with 100 problems and completed 48, leaving 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.  One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

Finally, to find the number of problems left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the number of problems completed on Wednesday from the number remaining after Tuesday: 52 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

29,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","**Reformatted Question:**

Garrett is popping popcorn.  [Popping Rate Increase]: Kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after 60 seconds. [Popping Rate Decrease]: In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. [Initial Popping Rate]: Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds. [Second Popping Rate]: Three times that amount pop in the next 30 seconds. [Residual Popping]: After removing from heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the popcorn popping into stages based on the provided information:

* **Stage 1 (First 30 seconds):** 20 kernels pop.
* **Stage 2 (Next 30 seconds):** Three times the amount of Stage 1, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.  This is consistent with the fact that the popping rate increases.
* **Stage 3 (Final 30 seconds):** The rate is half that of Stage 2, so 60 / 2 = 30 kernels pop. This reflects the slowing down of the popping rate mentioned in the problem.
* **Stage 4 (Residual Heat):** A quarter of the kernels from Stage 3 pop, so 30 / 4 = 7.5 kernels. Since we can't have half a kernel, we round this down to 7 kernels.

To find the total number of popcorn kernels, we add the kernels from each stage: 20 + 60 + 30 + 7 = 117 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has 117 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","**Reformatted Question:**

A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.  Each pepper costs $15. An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine the cost of a watermelon.  The problem states that ""A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs,"" and that ""each pepper costs $15"". Therefore, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. The problem says ""An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon,"" so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now we can calculate the total cost of Dillon's purchases:

* **Watermelons:** 4 watermelons * $45/watermelon = $180
* **Peppers:** 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300
* **Oranges:** 10 oranges * $40/orange = $400

Finally, we add up the cost of each item to find the total amount Dillon will spend: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Therefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880.

When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?","Reformatted Question: Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day.  [First alarm ring duration]: The first time it rang four times. [Second alarm ring duration]: The second time it rang for three times as long as the first time. [Third alarm ring duration]: The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?


Answer:

The question states that the first time the alarm rang, it rang four times.  This is our baseline ([First alarm ring duration]).

The second time it rang for three times as long as the first time ([Second alarm ring duration]).  Since the first time it rang four times, the second time it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time it rang for half as long as the second time ([Third alarm ring duration]).  The second time it rang 12 times, so the third time it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

**Answer:**

1. **Gum given to sister:** Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.  He gives half to his sister, leaving him with 20 / 2 = 10 pieces.

2. **Gum chewed at school:**  He's at school for 8 hours and chews 1 piece every 2 hours. This means he chews 8 hours / 2 hours/piece = 4 pieces of gum at school.

3. **Gum chewed after school:** He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, for a total of 2 pieces.

4. **Total gum chewed:** In total, Jim chews 4 (school) + 2 (home/dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

5. **Gum remaining:** After giving gum to his sister and chewing, Jim has 10 (remaining after sister) - 6 (chewed) = 4 pieces of gum left.

Therefore, Jim has 4 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

A farmer buys feed for his horses: two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes, twenty 65-pound sacks of oats, forty-two 75-pound bales of hay, and four 12-pound bags of carrots.  His farm truck has a 2250-pound weight capacity. How many trips are needed to transport all the feed?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
* **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

Next, we find the total weight of all the feed:

* Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 1300 pounds (oats) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 48 pounds (carrots) = 4500 pounds

Finally, we determine the number of trips needed.  The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds per trip. Therefore, the farmer needs 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips to transport all the feed.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast <tag4>3 days this week</tag4> using <tag5>one more slice per omelet</tag5> than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cheese used for sandwiches.  Carl ate a sandwich <tag1>every day this week</tag1>, which is 7 days, and used <tag2>2 slices of cheese</tag2> per sandwich.  Therefore, he used 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

Next, we consider the macaroni and cheese.  He used <tag3>8 slices of cheese</tag3> in the macaroni and cheese.

Finally, let's calculate the cheese used for omelets. He ate omelets for breakfast <tag4>3 days this week</tag4>, and each omelet used <tag5>one more slice</tag5> than a sandwich (which was 2 slices).  So, each omelet used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.  Over 3 days, he used 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

To find the total amount of cheese used, we add the cheese from all sources: 14 slices (sandwiches) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) + 9 slices (omelets) = 31 slices.

Therefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is {31}.

[Third Race Loss]: On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.  What was his average loss for the day?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the winnings from the second race.  His dad lost $5 in the first race, so according to [Second Race Winnings], he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

Next, let's determine his loss in the third race.  According to [Third Race Loss], he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate his total winnings and losses for the day. He lost $5 [First Race Loss], won $11 [Second Race Winnings], and lost $16.50 [Third Race Loss].  Therefore, his total loss is $5 + $16.50 - $11 = $10.50.

Finally, to find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $10.50 / 3 races = $3.50 per race.

Therefore, his average loss for the day was $3.50.  The answer is {3.50}.

James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys [Number of Suits] 10 suits and [Number of Dress Pants] 10 dress pants.  The suits cost [$750 per suit] $750 each and the dress pants cost [Fraction of Suit Cost] 1/5 that cost.  He also buys [Number of Shirts per Suit] 3 dress shirts per suit.  The dress shirts were [$60 per shirt] $60 each.  How much did everything cost?


**Key Phrases:**

* Number of Suits
* Number of Dress Pants
* $750 per suit
* 1/5 that cost (dress pants cost)
* Number of Shirts per Suit
* $60 per shirt


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants.  The question states that the dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of a suit, and the suits cost $750 each. Therefore, each pair of dress pants cost (1/5) * $750 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the dress pants. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the suits.  James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to determine the total cost of the dress shirts.  The problem states that James bought 3 dress shirts per suit, and he bought 10 suits.  This means he bought 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.  Since each shirt cost $60, the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, to find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

Therefore, everything cost $10800.

Randy has [initial_oatmeal: 9] oatmeal cookies, [initial_chocolate_chip: 4] chocolate chip cookies, and [initial_sugar: 5] sugar cookies. He ate [snack_cookies: 3] cookies for a snack, one of each flavor. He gives [given_sugar: 2] sugar cookies to his friends. Then, he bakes [baked_cookies: 4] of each flavor for dinner. He ate [lunch_oatmeal: 2] oatmeal cookies for lunch. How many cookies does he have now?


**Answer:**

Let's track each cookie type separately:

* **Oatmeal Cookies:** Randy started with [initial_oatmeal: 9] oatmeal cookies. He ate 1 for a snack ([snack_cookies: 3]), leaving 8. He baked 4 more ([baked_cookies: 4]), bringing the total to 12. He then ate 2 for lunch ([lunch_oatmeal: 2]), leaving him with 10 oatmeal cookies.

* **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** Randy started with [initial_chocolate_chip: 4] chocolate chip cookies. He ate 1 for a snack ([snack_cookies: 3]), leaving 3. He baked 4 more ([baked_cookies: 4]), giving him a total of 7 chocolate chip cookies.

* **Sugar Cookies:** Randy started with [initial_sugar: 5] sugar cookies. He ate 1 for a snack ([snack_cookies: 3]), leaving 4. He gave 2 away ([given_sugar: 2]), leaving 2. He baked 4 more ([baked_cookies: 4]), resulting in a total of 6 sugar cookies.

To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we add the number of each type: 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23 cookies.

Therefore, Randy has a total of **23** cookies now.

39,"Jamaal is at the gym. At the beginning, he was using an 8-pound weight. After 2 hours, it turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than before. After one hour, he increases the weight that he uses by 50%. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?","**Reformatted Question:**

Jamaal [starts with an 8-pound weight] [after 2 hours switches to a weight two pounds lighter] [after one hour increases the weight by 50%]. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?


**Answer:**

At the beginning, Jamaal uses an 8-pound weight.  After 2 hours, he switches to a weight that is two pounds lighter. This means he is now using 8 - 2 = 6 pounds.  After one more hour, he increases this weight by 50%. A 50% increase of 6 pounds is 6 * 0.5 = 3 pounds. Therefore, his final weight is 6 + 3 = 9 pounds.
The answer is {9}.

40,A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"**Reformatted Question:**

At a new arcade, Jack and his three friends play games.  Jack's game time per quarter: [Jack's game time], Two friends' game time per quarter: [Worse friends' game time], One friend's game time per quarter: [Better friend's game time], Total playtime: [Total playtime], How much money was spent?


**Key Phrases:**

* Jack's game time
* Worse friends' game time
* Better friend's game time
* Total playtime


**Answer:**

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.  Two of his friends play half as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.  His other friend plays 1.5 times as long as Jack, or 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

They played for a total of 4 hours, which is 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Let's calculate the game time for each person:

* **Jack:**  He plays for 240 minutes.  Since he plays 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* **Worse friends:** Each of the two worse friends plays for 240 minutes. Since they play 10 minutes per quarter, each uses 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters.  Together, they use 24 quarters/friend * 2 friends = 48 quarters.
* **Better friend:** The better friend plays for 240 minutes. Since he plays 30 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they used 12 quarters + 48 quarters + 8 quarters = 68 quarters.

Assuming each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money spent is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is $\boxed{$17}$.

41,Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  40% of the remaining movies that are not in series are older movies which are $5.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Mike wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has a total of [Total Movies: 600] movies. [Series Movies Percentage: A third] of his movies are in various series, and he can buy those for [Series Discount: $6] less than the cost of a normal movie.  [Non-Series Movies Percentage: 40%] of the remaining movies (those not in series) are older movies costing [Older Movie Price: $5] each.  A normal movie costs [Normal Movie Price: $10]. How much does replacing the movies cost?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine the number of movies in series.  Since a third of Mike's [Total Movies: 600] movies are in series, he has (1/3) * 600 = 200 movies in series.

Next, let's find the number of movies *not* in series.  This is the total number of movies minus the number of series movies: 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

Now, let's calculate the number of older movies.  [Non-Series Movies Percentage: 40%] of the non-series movies are older movies, so there are 0.40 * 400 = 160 older movies.

The number of newer non-series movies is 400 - 160 = 240 movies.

The cost of the series movies is 200 movies * ([Normal Movie Price: $10] - [Series Discount: $6]) = 200 * $4 = $800.

The cost of the older movies is 160 movies * [Older Movie Price: $5] = $800.

The cost of the newer non-series movies is 240 movies * [Normal Movie Price: $10] = $2400.

Therefore, the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is $800 + $800 + $2400 = $4000.

43,Walter is collecting money for charity. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. First Walter collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Walter is collecting money for charity.  [Donation Amount from Neighbors]: His neighbors donate $500. [Donation Amount from Online Fund]: He collects $1500 from an online fund. [Friend's Donation]: A friend donates $200. [Lawyer's Donation]: His lawyer will donate three times the total amount from other sources.  How much will Walter's lawyer contribute?


**Answer:**

To determine the lawyer's contribution, we need to calculate the total amount donated from sources other than the lawyer.  This includes the donations from Walter's neighbors, the online fund, and his friend.

* [Donation Amount from Neighbors]: Neighbors donated $500.
* [Donation Amount from Online Fund]: Online fund donated $1500.
* [Friend's Donation]: Friend donated $200.

The total from these sources is $500 + $1500 + $200 = $2200.

The lawyer's donation is three times this amount: 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6600.

In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  How many students are leaving early?","**Reformatted Question:**

In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, <fact1>20% are football players</fact1>.  <fact2>Out of the remaining class, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band</fact2>. How many students are leaving early?  (<fact3>Students who are football players, cheerleaders, or part of the band are leaving early</fact3>).


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine the number of football players leaving early.  <fact1>20% of the 30 students are football players</fact1>, so there are 0.20 * 30 = 6 football players.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after the football players leave.  This is 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders and band members leaving early. <fact2>25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or in the band</fact2>, so there are 0.25 * 24 = 6 cheerleaders and band members.

Finally, to find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders/band members: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

Therefore, <fact3>12 students are leaving early</fact3>.  The answer is {12}.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","**Reformatted Question:**

Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill a tank with a capacity of [Tank Capacity: 18000 gallons] in two days. On the first day, Wanda filled [Wanda Day 1: 1/4] of the tank's capacity. Ms. B pumped [Ms. B Day 1: 3/4 of Wanda's Day 1 amount]. On the second day, Wanda pumped [Wanda Day 2: 2/3 of Wanda's Day 1 amount], while Ms. B pumped [Ms. B Day 2: 1/3 of Ms. B's Day 1 amount]. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate how much water Wanda pumped on the first day:

* Wanda Day 1: (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons

Next, let's calculate how much water Ms. B pumped on the first day:

* Ms. B Day 1: (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons

Now, let's calculate how much water Wanda pumped on the second day:

* Wanda Day 2: (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons

And let's calculate how much water Ms. B pumped on the second day:

* Ms. B Day 2: (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons

Now we can find the total amount of water pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:

* Total gallons pumped: 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons

Finally, to find out how many gallons are remaining to fill the tank, we subtract the total gallons pumped from the tank's capacity:

* Gallons remaining: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons

Therefore, 6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.

He's already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?","**Reformatted Question:**

George needs to pay for dental work.  He needs [Number of Implants] 2 implants. Each implant has a [Base Price] base price of $2000. The crown costs an extra [Crown Cost] $500. For [Number of Porcelain Crowns] one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. He's already put down a [Deposit] deposit of $600. He makes [Hourly Wage] $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.  George needs 2 implants, each costing $2000: 2 implants * $2000/implant = $4000.

One implant needs a porcelain crown costing an additional $500.  Therefore, the total cost of the implants and crowns is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600.  This means he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George earns $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15/hour = 260 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for his dental work.

But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?","**Reformatted Question:**

Boris owns a chocolate factory.  He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. [Production Goal: 50,000 bars/month] The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. [Week 2 Production: Half of Week 1] But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. [Week 3 Production: Triple Week 1] Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. [Week 1 Production: 8,000 bars] How much does he produce the fourth week? [Week 4 Production: ?]


**Answer:**

The question states that Boris produces a total of 50,000 chocolate bars each month.  We are given the production for the first week (8,000 bars).

* **Week 2 Production:**  The second week's production is half of the first week's production: 8,000 bars / 2 = 4,000 bars.

* **Week 3 Production:** The third week's production is three times the first week's production: 8,000 bars * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the fourth week's production, we need to consider the total monthly production.  The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since the total monthly production is 50,000 bars, the fourth week's production must be the difference between the total monthly production and the sum of the first three weeks' production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

**Answer: {14000}**

Julia, preparing for a dinner party, [noticed she was out of plastic spoons] and [bought a new package of spoons].  Her husband later gave her [5 new spoons].  She then [used three spoons to sample her stew], and finally had [12 spoons] total. How many spoons were in the package Julia initially bought?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Final Spoon Count:** Julia ended up with 12 spoons.

2. **Husband's Spoons:** Her husband gave her 5 spoons.  This means that before her husband's contribution, she had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons.

3. **Spoons Used for Stew:** Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.  This means that before using the spoons for the stew, she had 7 + 3 = 10 spoons.

4. **Initial Package:**  The 10 spoons Julia had before sampling the stew represent the number of spoons in the package she initially bought.

Therefore, there were 10 spoons in the package Julia bought.

A jellyfish tank contains numerous jellyfish.  [Fraction of large jellyfish]: A fifth of the jellyfish are large. [Fraction of color-changing jellyfish]: A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. [Number of color-changing jellyfish]: When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. [Other jellyfish]: The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.  [Total number of jellyfish]: How many jellyfish are in the tank?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step using the information provided:

1. **Number of color-changing jellyfish:** We know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.  This represents the jellyfish that are both large and change color.

2. **Number of large jellyfish:** Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color (from the [Fraction of color-changing jellyfish] statement), and 6 jellyfish changed color, there must be 6 jellyfish * 3 = 18 large jellyfish in total.

3. **Total number of jellyfish:**  A fifth of the jellyfish are large ([Fraction of large jellyfish] statement).  Since there are 18 large jellyfish, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 18 jellyfish * 5 = 90 jellyfish.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.  The answer is {90}.

50,"Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?","**Reformatted Question:**

Maria's power bank was not fully charged before she left for the park.  At the park, her friends charged their phones, causing the power bank to lose 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours. After 5 hours, the remaining charge was 28%.  For the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?


**Answer:**

Let's work backward from the final charge to determine the initial charge.

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge after the 7% loss:**  After 3 hours of losing 7% per hour, the power bank lost a total of 7% * 3 hours = 21%.  Since the final charge was 28%, the charge *before* this 3-hour period was 28% + 21% = 49%.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge before the 5-hour 9% loss:** This 49% represents the charge remaining *after* the 5-hour period where the power bank lost 9% per hour.  Over 5 hours, the power bank lost a total of 9% * 5 hours = 45%.  Therefore, the charge *before* this 5-hour period (i.e., when Maria left for the park) was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","**Reformatted Question:**

Rose picks [flowers with 5 petals]: 3 flowers, [flowers with 6 petals]: 4 flowers, [flowers with 4 petals]: 5 flowers.  She drops 1 of each type. Then she picks [flowers with 7 petals]: 6 flowers and drops 1. How many petals are in the vase?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the petals from the initial flower picking:

*   Flowers with 5 petals: 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
*   Flowers with 6 petals: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
*   Flowers with 4 petals: 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

Next, let's account for the dropped flowers:

*   Dropped flowers: 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, and 1 flower with 4 petals.  This is a total of 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals lost.

Now, let's calculate the petals from the second flower picking:

*   Flowers with 7 petals: 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Finally, let's account for the dropped flower from the second picking:

*   Dropped flower: 1 flower with 7 petals = 7 petals lost.

To find the total number of petals in the vase, we add the petals from the initial picking, subtract the dropped flowers from the initial picking, add the petals from the second picking, and subtract the dropped flower from the second picking:

Total petals = (15 + 24 + 20) - 15 + 42 - 7 = 59 + 42 - 7 = 84 petals

Therefore, there are a total of 84 petals on the flowers in the vase.

The answer is {84}.

A charity group is having a yard sale.  [People donating boxes]: 10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each. [Existing boxes]: They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. [Boxes per table]: They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table. [Existing tables]: They already own 15 tables.  [Question]: How many new tables do they need?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes from donations: [People donating boxes] 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

Next, let's find the total number of boxes:  50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 boxes.

Now, let's determine how many tables are needed for those boxes: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

Finally, let's calculate how many *new* tables are needed: 30 tables (needed) - 15 tables (already owned) = 15 tables.

Carlos, Jim, and Carrey collected seashells at the beach.  [Jim's Seashells]: Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than Carlos. [Carlos' Seashells]: Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. [Equal Division]: They divided the total seashells equally.  How many seashells did each person get?


**Answer:**

First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected.  Jim collected 27 seashells, and this was 5 more than Carlos ([Jim's Seashells]). Therefore, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Next, we need to determine how many seashells Carrey collected. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey ([Carlos' Seashells]).  So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now we can calculate the total number of seashells collected.  The total is 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Finally, since they divided the seashells equally ([Equal Division]), each person received 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?


**Answer:**

In the first 6 hours, <fact1>30 bees left the hive</fact1>.

In the second 6 hours, <fact2>1/2 * 30 = 15 bees returned</fact2>.

This means that 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours had not yet returned.

In the third 6 hours, <fact4>2 * 30 = 60 bees left the hive</fact4>.

<fact3>In the last 6 hours, all the bees that had left and not yet returned came back</fact3>.  This includes the 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and had not returned, and the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours.

How many checks does Buford write per year, given that he writes many checks (unspecified number) yearly, one check monthly for gas, one check monthly for electricity, two checks monthly for church, and one check quarterly for pest and lawn service?


**Answer:**

Let's break down Buford's check writing:

* **Gas bill:** 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks per year
* **Electricity bill:** 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks per year
* **Church:** 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks per year
* **Pest and lawn service:** 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks per year

The question states Buford writes ""many checks every year,"" but doesn't give a number.  Therefore, we can only calculate the checks written for the specified bills.  Adding those together: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.  The total number of checks written is at least 52.

Mr. Tan sold his house for [$400,000] (selling price).  He paid transfer fees of [3%] of the selling price and a brokerage fee of [5%] of the selling price.  He also paid [$250,000] to settle the remaining loan.  What are Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total of fees and loan repayment is $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Finally, to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

57,"Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?","**Reformatted Question:**

Three little wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous, howl at the moon every night.  `Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias`. `Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined`.  `Each of Tobias' howls lasts 20 seconds`. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the howling time for each wolf:

* **Tobias:** Each howl lasts 20 seconds.  We need to know *how many* howls Tobias does to determine his total howling time.  The problem doesn't specify the number of howls, so we'll assume it's one howl for simplicity.  Therefore, Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

* **Chikote:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias (`Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias`).  Since Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

* **Igneous:** Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined (`Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined`).  This means Igneous howls for 20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

To find the combined howling time, we add the howling times of all three wolves: 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

Finally, we convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

58,"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?","**Reformatted Question:**

Joe has [$50] to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out costs [$25]. There is a [30% off sale] at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for [$35].  Assuming that [sales tax is included], how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt.  The shirt costs $25, and there's a 30% discount, so the discount amount is 30% of $25:  0.30 * $25 = $7.50.  Subtracting the discount from the original price, the shirt's final price is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, let's find the total cost of the outfit. Joe buys a shirt for $17.50 and shorts for $35, so the total cost is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Finally, let's determine how much money Joe has left. He started with $50 and spent $52.50.  Since he spent more than he had, he will be short $2.50.  Therefore, Joe will have -$2.50 left after the purchase (meaning he needs an additional $2.50).

59,"On Tuesday, Clara got $2 off at the till because she had a voucher. She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","**Reformatted Question:**

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday, receiving a $2 voucher discount.  On Wednesday, the price increased to $30 per pomegranate with a 10% discount offered. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates on Wednesday. What is the difference between the final prices Clara and Sheila paid?


**Answer:**

Let's calculate Clara's total cost first.  She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, resulting in a pre-discount cost of 20 * $20 = $400. With her $2 voucher discount, her final cost was $400 - $2 = $398.

Now let's calculate Sheila's total cost. She bought 20 pomegranates at the new price of $30 each, for a pre-discount cost of 20 * $30 = $600.  The store offered a 10% discount, so Sheila received a discount of $600 * 0.10 = $60.  Therefore, her final cost was $600 - $60 = $540.

Finally, to find the difference between the final prices, we subtract Clara's cost from Sheila's cost: $540 - $398 = $142.

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

60,"Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?","**Reformatted Question:**

Ellie is organizing her books.  [Shelf Capacity]: The bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf. [Top Shelf Capacity]: The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. [Middle Shelf Capacity]: Each middle shelf holds 10 books. [Total Books]: She has 110 books. [Question]: How many bookcases does she need?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf.  Since each of the two middle shelves holds 10 books ([Middle Shelf Capacity]), a single middle shelf holds 10 books. The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf ([Shelf Capacity]), so it holds 10 books * 2 = 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf ([Top Shelf Capacity]), meaning it holds 20 books - 5 books = 15 books.

Now let's calculate the total capacity of a single bookcase: 20 books (bottom) + 10 books (middle) + 10 books (middle) + 15 books (top) = 55 books.

Finally, to find out how many bookcases Ellie needs, we divide her total number of books by the capacity of a single bookcase: 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

Therefore, Ellie needs 2 bookcases to hold all 110 of her books.

The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","**Reformatted Question:**

[Toy Count] Sophie has a tower of stacking rings with [Ring Count] 9 rings, a bag of building blocks with [Block Count] 31 blocks, and a bin of stuffed animals with [Animal Count] 8 stuffed animals.  After buying a tube of bouncy balls, she has a total of [Total Toy Count] 62 toys.  How many bouncy balls [Bouncy Ball Count] are in the tube?


**Answer:**

To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we need to subtract the number of other toys Sophie already had from her total number of toys.

Sophie had:

* [Ring Count] 9 stacking rings
* [Block Count] 31 building blocks
* [Animal Count] 8 stuffed animals

The total number of these toys is 9 + 31 + 8 = 48 toys.

After buying the bouncy balls, Sophie had [Total Toy Count] 62 toys.  Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is the difference between the total number of toys and the number of other toys:

[Total Toy Count] 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls

Therefore, there are [Bouncy Ball Count] 14 bouncy balls in the tube.

62,Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce. John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  How many calories is the omelet?,"**Reformatted Question:**

[Calories][Eggs] Eggs are 75 calories each. [Calories][Cheese] Cheese is 120 calories per ounce. [Calories][Ham] Ham is 40 calories per ounce. [Omelet] John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham. How many calories is the omelet?


**Answer:**

The omelet contains 6 eggs.  Since each egg is 75 calories ([Calories][Eggs]), the eggs contribute 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

The omelet includes 2 ounces of cheese.  With cheese being 120 calories per ounce ([Calories][Cheese]), the cheese contributes 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

The omelet has an equal amount of ham as cheese, meaning 2 ounces of ham.  Since ham is 40 calories per ounce ([Calories][Ham]), the ham contributes 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the omelet is the sum of the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

The answer is {770}.

She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  The returned item cost $15.00. What is the new balance on her credit card?","**Reformatted Question:**

Sheila's initial credit card balance was $85.00.  She then returned an item costing $15.00. Subsequently, she purchased a frying pan (20% off $20.00) and a set of towels (10% off $30.00), adding these purchases to her credit card. What is Sheila's new credit card balance?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the returned item:  The question states the returned item cost $15.00.  Subtracting this from the initial balance gives us: $85.00 (initial balance) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the frying pan: The frying pan was 20% off $20.00.  A 20% discount means the discount amount is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the final cost of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the towels: The towels were 10% off $30.00.  A 10% discount means the discount amount is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00.  Therefore, the final cost of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the frying pan and towels to the adjusted balance after the return: $70.00 (adjusted balance) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00.

Therefore, Sheila's new credit card balance is $113.00.

A hotel costs [$1500] per day normally, but is [20%] more expensive on a busy weekend.  Plane tickets cost [$5000] each.  If a trip lasts [3 days], what is the total cost?


**Answer:**

The normal daily hotel cost is [$1500].  Because it's a busy weekend, the cost is increased by [20%], which is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.  Therefore, the daily cost is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For a [3-day] trip, the hotel cost is $1800/day * 3 days = $5400.

The plane tickets cost [$5000] each, and there are two tickets, so the total cost for plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

The total cost of the trip is the hotel cost plus the plane ticket cost: $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15400.

He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mark, a copy-editor, edits a total of [Total Sentences: 1000] sentences each week.  Publisher A pays him [Publisher A Rate: 5 cents] per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark [Publisher B Rate: twice what Publisher A pays]. He edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?


**Answer:**

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week ([Total Sentences: 1000]).  He divides his work equally between Publisher A and Publisher B, meaning he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence ([Publisher A Rate: 5 cents]). Therefore, Mark earns 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays ([Publisher B Rate: twice what Publisher A pays]), so Publisher B pays 5 cents/sentence * 2 = 10 cents/sentence.  Mark earns 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

In total, Mark makes 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents per week.

How many friends can she invite?","**Reformatted Question:**

Morgan has a birthday party budget of [$90].  Mini-golf costs [$5] per round. She wants [$5] in arcade tokens. Go-karts cost [$10] per ride, and she wants to ride them twice. How many friends can she invite if everyone plays mini-golf once?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Morgan's total expenses for go-karts:  Go-karts cost $10 per ride, and she wants two rides, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, let's add up her fixed costs:  She needs $5 for arcade tokens and $20 for go-karts, totaling $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, let's account for mini-golf.  Mini-golf costs $5 per person, and Morgan herself will play, so that's $5.  This means that the remaining budget for her friends' mini-golf is $90 (total budget) - $25 (fixed costs) - $5 (Morgan's mini-golf) = $60.

Finally, to find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining mini-golf budget by the cost per friend: $60 / $5 = 12 friends.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party.

[Soccer Game] [Pizza Cost] [Number of People] [Team Members] [Coaches]  If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?


**Answer:**

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches at the soccer game, for a total of 12 + 3 = 15 people.  Each team member brings 2 guests, so there are an additional 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  This means there are a total of 15 + 24 = 39 people at the game.

Each pizza serves 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $\boxed{195}$ dollars.

[Budget Constraint]: Mrs. Cruz has a budget of $400,000 for a house.  [Property Price]: A property is listed at $350,000. [Brokerage Fee]: A 5% brokerage fee is added to the selling price. [Transfer Fee]: A 12% transfer fee is added to the selling price.  [Question]: How much more is the total price of the house (including fees) than Mrs. Cruz's budget?


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of the $350,000 selling price is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

Next, we calculate the transfer fee: 12% of the $350,000 selling price is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we find the total cost of the house by adding the selling price and both fees: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Finally, we determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Cruz's budget: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

A blog article takes an average of [article_writing_time: 4 hours] to research and write. Meredith, a freelance blogger, wrote [monday_articles: 5 articles] on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote [tuesday_articles: 2/5 times more articles than Monday]. On Wednesday, she wrote [wednesday_articles: twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday]. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.


**Answer:**

First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.  She wrote 2/5 times *more* articles on Tuesday than on Monday, meaning she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

Next, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday. She wrote twice the number of articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday, so she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now we know the total number of articles written over the three days: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Finally, since each article takes [article_writing_time: 4 hours] to write, Meredith spent a total of 26 articles * [article_writing_time: 4 hours/article] = 104 hours writing articles over the three days.

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours.

[Class 3B][School Points][Behavior Points][Trip Threshold] Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior.  Adam has collected 50 points. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.  [Minimum Points Required] The minimum threshold for a class trip is 400 points. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Betty's points.  Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, who has 50 points.  A 30% increase on 50 points is (30/100) * 50 = 15 points. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Next, let's find Tom's points. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Now, let's calculate Marta's points. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, who has 35 points.  Therefore, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class are Adam's points (50) + Marta's points (105) + Betty's points (65) + Tom's points (35) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the class trip is 400 points.  Therefore, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

The answer is {145}.

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","**Reformatted Question:**

Bob, starting with a pond containing [initial_fish_count] fish ([initial_orange_fish] orange and [initial_white_fish] white), bought [bought_fish_count] fish from a pet store.  After adding the [bought_fish_count] fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?  ([initial_fish_count]=7, [initial_orange_fish]=3, [initial_white_fish]=4, [bought_fish_count]=17)


**Answer:**

Bob started with [initial_white_fish] = 4 white fish and [initial_orange_fish] = 3 orange fish in his pond.  He bought a total of [bought_fish_count] = 17 fish. Let's say he bought 'x' white fish and 'y' orange fish.  Therefore, x + y = 17.

After adding the new fish, Bob had (4 + x) white fish and (3 + y) orange fish.  The problem states that he then had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be written as an equation:

(3 + y) = 2(4 + x)

We have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) x + y = 17
2) 3 + y = 8 + 2x

We can solve for x (the number of white fish bought) by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From equation (1), we can express y as: y = 17 - x.  Substitute this into equation (2):

3 + (17 - x) = 8 + 2x
20 - x = 8 + 2x
12 = 3x
x = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish.
The answer is {4}.

**Answer:**

To determine the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to consider the stickers collected over the three years.

* **Two years ago:** Leo had [Time_Period_1: 100 stickers].
* **Last year:** Leo collected [Collection_Last_Year: 50 stickers].
* **This year:**  Leo collected [Collection_This_Year: twice the number of stickers as the previous year], which means he collected 2 * [Collection_Last_Year: 50 stickers] = 100 stickers.

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is the sum of stickers from all three years: [Time_Period_1: 100 stickers] + [Collection_Last_Year: 50 stickers] + 100 stickers = 250 stickers.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","**Reformatted Question:**

A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys.  [Number of toys ordered: 400] 5 workers are available to work on the order. [Number of workers: 5] They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, [Shift length: 10 hours] and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. [Unshipped toys: 20] 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, [Worker productivity group 1: 6 toys/hour] and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. [Worker productivity group 2: 4 toys/hour] How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce? [Target: Fifth worker's productivity]


**Answer:**

The total number of toys needed is 400.  Since 20 toys are still needed after the 10-hour shift, the workers produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys during the shift.

Two workers produced 6 toys/hour each, for a combined output of 2 workers * 6 toys/hour/worker = 12 toys/hour.  Over 10 hours, they produced 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

Two other workers produced 4 toys/hour each, for a combined output of 2 workers * 4 toys/hour/worker = 8 toys/hour. Over 10 hours, they produced 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

The total output of the first four workers was 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

The fifth worker, therefore, produced 380 toys (total produced) - 200 toys (output of the first four workers) = 180 toys during the 10-hour shift.

To find the fifth worker's hourly production rate, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

[Delivery Fee]:  There was a flat [$3.00] delivery fee.  [Final Price]: What was the final price of Stephen's groceries after all fees?


**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the total cost before the delivery vendor's fees.  This is the sum of Stephen's initial grocery bill and his tip: $40.00 (Grocery Bill) + $4.00 (Tip) = $44.00.

Next, we calculate the 25% fee charged by the delivery vendor: $44.00 * 0.25 (Delivery Fee Percentage) = $11.00.

Finally, we add the delivery vendor's fee and the flat delivery fee to the total cost before fees: $44.00 + $11.00 + $3.00 (Delivery Fee) = $58.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all fees was $58.00.

76,Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"**Reformatted Question:**

A jar with a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches contains jelly beans.  Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency.  30% of the jelly beans are red. Tim estimates the number of red jelly beans. The true number of red jelly beans is 900. How far off was Tim's guess?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total volume of the jar:

* Jar volume: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

Next, we account for the packing efficiency:

* Effective volume: 540 cubic inches * 80% = 432 cubic inches

Now, we determine the number of jelly beans the jar can hold:

* Number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

Then, we calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans:

* Estimated red jelly beans: 2880 jelly beans * 30% = 864 red jelly beans

Finally, we find the difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans:

* Difference: |864 red jelly beans - 900 red jelly beans| = 36 red jelly beans

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 jelly beans.

77,"Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?","**Reformatted Question:**

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.  Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?


**Answer:**

We know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, and this amount was five times the number of white carnations.  Therefore, the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 40 * 4 = 160.

To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

78,Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.  One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Sidney ordered [Number of sandwiches initially ordered] meatball sub sandwiches, where [Number of sandwiches initially ordered] is 3 less than ten. Each sandwich contains [Number of meatballs per sandwich] meatballs. Mark ate [Number of sandwiches eaten by Mark] sandwiches. Sidney then ordered [Number of sandwiches reordered] more sandwiches.  How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine how many sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:  10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Next, let's calculate the total number of meatballs in those initial sandwiches: 7 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 sandwiches, removing 4 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate some, Sidney had 28 meatballs - 16 meatballs = 12 meatballs remaining.

Sidney then ordered 3 more sandwiches, adding 3 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 12 meatballs.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches is 12 meatballs + 12 meatballs = 24 meatballs.

The answer is {24}.

79,John drives to his friend's house. He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph. The friend's house is 200 miles away. How long did the trip take?,"**Reformatted Question:**

John drives to his friend's house [**distance to friend's house: 200 miles**], driving at a speed of [**speed to friend's house: 70 mph**]. He takes a detour adding [**detour distance: 10 miles**] to his trip.  The return trip home is [**distance home: 240 miles**] at a speed of [**speed home: 80 mph**]. How long did the entire trip take?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the time it took John to drive to his friend's house.  The detour added 10 miles to the original 200-mile distance, resulting in a total distance of 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles.  Using the formula time = distance / speed, the time to his friend's house was 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time it took John to drive home.  The distance home was 240 miles, and his speed was 80 mph.  Therefore, the time taken for the return trip was 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Finally, to find the total trip time, we add the time to his friend's house and the time back home: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Therefore, the entire trip took John 6 hours.

80,"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?","**Reformatted Question:**

Cole bought tattered jeans costing $28 and jogger jeans costing $6 less than the tattered jeans.  He saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans, with 1/3 of the total savings coming from the jogger jeans and the remaining 2/3 from the tattered jeans. How much more did the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans before the sale?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans.  The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Next, let's determine how much Cole saved on each pair of jeans.  He saved a total of $6. Since 1/3 of the savings came from the jogger jeans, he saved (1/3) * $6 = $2 on the jogger jeans.  The remaining savings on the tattered jeans was $6 - $2 = $4.

Now we can calculate the sale price of each pair of jeans.  The sale price of the jogger jeans was $22 - $2 = $20. The sale price of the tattered jeans was $28 - $4 = $24.

Finally, to find the difference in the original prices, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans: $22 (original jogger jeans price) - $28 (original tattered jeans price) = -$6.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 *less* than the tattered jeans.  The question asks for the difference, which is $6.  The wording is a bit tricky, as it implies a positive difference, but the actual difference is -$6.

81,"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  He gets a loan worth 40% of his house.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?","**Reformatted Question:**

John's house is worth [$250,000]. He gets a loan worth [40%] of his house's value. He uses [60%] of the loan amount to pay off his debts. How much money did he have leftover after paying his debts?


**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the total loan amount John received.  His house is worth $250,000, and he received a loan worth 40% of that value.  Therefore, the loan amount is 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.

Next, we determine how much of the loan John used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount for this purpose.  So, the amount used to pay debts is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Finally, to find out how much money John had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying his debts.

82,"An air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","**Reformatted Question:**

An air conditioner ran on low for [Time_Low: 3 hours], then it was turned up to high for [Time_High: 4 hours]. Afterward, it was turned off for [Time_Off: 2 hours]. The air conditioner cools the room [Cooling_Rate_Low: 2 degrees] an hour on low and [Cooling_Rate_High: 3 degrees] an hour on high. The room will warm up at [Warming_Rate: 2 degrees] an hour with no air conditioner running. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cooling effect during the time the air conditioner was on.

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner ran on low for [Time_Low: 3 hours] at a rate of [Cooling_Rate_Low: 2 degrees/hour].  This resulted in a cooling of 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

* **High setting:** The air conditioner ran on high for [Time_High: 4 hours] at a rate of [Cooling_Rate_High: 3 degrees/hour]. This resulted in a cooling of 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect from the air conditioner is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the warming effect while the air conditioner was off.

* **Off:** The air conditioner was off for [Time_Off: 2 hours], and the room warmed up at a rate of [Warming_Rate: 2 degrees/hour]. This resulted in a warming of 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

Finally, to find the net change in temperature, we subtract the warming effect from the cooling effect:

Net temperature change = Total cooling - Total warming = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The answer is {14}.

Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?","**Reformatted Question:**

Jason, a car salesperson, needs to sell 15 cars this month.  For every two customers, one buys a car. For every 25 telephone calls, one customer visits the dealership. How many telephone calls must Jason make to sell 15 cars?


**Answer:**

To sell 15 cars, Jason needs twice as many customers because ""for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car"".  Therefore, he needs 15 cars * 2 customers/car = 30 customers.

Since ""for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership"", he needs 30 customers * 25 calls/customer = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

84,"Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.  She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","**Reformatted Question:**

Millie's Lemonade Stand:  [Cost of Supplies] [Lemonade per Pitcher] [Cups Sold per Hour] [Price per Cup] [Number of Pitchers]  If Millie sells all the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie makes.  She makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, let's determine her total revenue. She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's calculate her total costs.  She spends $18 on supplies.

Therefore, her total profit is her total revenue minus her total costs: $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, we need to find her profit per hour.  She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups to sell.  Therefore, she will spend 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours selling all her lemonade.

Her profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours she works: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour.

He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?","**Reformatted Question:**

Tim needs to make lemonade for a pool party.  [Lemons to Juice Ratio]: 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. [Lemonade Recipe]: 1 cup of lemon juice is needed for 1 gallon of lemonade. [Lemonade Needed]: He needs 4 gallons for the party. [Extra Lemonade]: His friend wants an extra gallon, twice as tart. [Tartness Factor]: Twice as tart means twice the lemon juice.  How many lemons will Tim need in total?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs for the party lemonade.  He needs 4 gallons of lemonade, and [Lemonade Recipe] states that 1 gallon requires 1 cup of juice. Therefore, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice for the party.

Next, let's consider Allen's request.  Allen wants an extra gallon that's twice as tart, meaning it needs twice the amount of lemon juice.  This means he needs an additional 2 cups of lemon juice (1 cup/gallon * 2).

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Finally, we need to calculate the number of lemons.  [Lemons to Juice Ratio] tells us that 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice.  Therefore, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

The answer is {36}.

Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar.  [Friend 1's guess]: The first friend says 80. [Friend 2's guess]: The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend. [Friend 3's guess]: The third friend says 25% more than the first friend. What is their average guess?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine each friend's guess:

* **Friend 1's guess:** 80 (given in the problem)
* **Friend 2's guess:**  The second friend guessed 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess. Half of Friend 1's guess (80) is 40.  Adding 20 to this gives Friend 2's guess of 40 + 20 = 60.
* **Friend 3's guess:** The third friend guessed 25% more than Friend 1's guess. 25% of 80 is (25/100) * 80 = 20. Adding this to Friend 1's guess gives Friend 3's guess of 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average guess, we sum up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends:

Average guess = (Friend 1's guess + Friend 2's guess + Friend 3's guess) / 3 
Average guess = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3
Average guess = 240 / 3
Average guess = 80

Therefore, the average guess of the three friends is 80.

If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","**Reformatted Question:**

Frankie's TV Watching Habits:  [Monday/Tuesday viewing], [Wednesday viewing], [Thursday viewing], [Friday viewing], [Total viewing time].  If Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, and we know his viewing habits on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Frankie's total viewing time on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

* **Monday:** 1 hour
* **Tuesday:** 1 hour
* **Thursday:** 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
* **Friday:** 2 hours

This adds up to 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV ([Total viewing time]), his Wednesday viewing time was 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

On Wednesday, Frankie watched several 30-minute episodes ([Wednesday viewing]).  Since 1.5 hours is equal to 1.5 * 2 = 3 thirty-minute episodes, he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 thirty-minute episodes on Wednesday.

**Answer:**

First, let's determine how many $20 bills Thomas initially withdrew: $1000 / $20/bill = 50 bills.

Next, he lost 10 bills getting home, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He then used half of his remaining bills to pay a bill, leaving him with 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

After tripling his money, he had 20 bills * 3 = 60 bills.  These are still $20 bills.

Finally, he converted all his $20 bills to $5 bills.  Since each $20 bill is equivalent to four $5 bills ( $20 / $5/bill = 4 bills), he now has 60 bills * 4 bills/$20 bill = 240 five-dollar bills.

Therefore, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.

If it takes Wayne four minutes [travel_time_wayne] to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne [arrival_time_difference] to get to the theater first?


**Answer:**

It takes Wayne four minutes [travel_time_wayne] to get to the theater.  Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's [travel_time_bernadette_relative], so her drive takes 4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes.

96,"To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day than he planted on the first day. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.","**Reformatted Question:**

At the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted [Number of White Oak trees on Day 1: 20] White Oak trees and [Number of Lodgepole Pine trees on Day 1: 40] Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day. On the second day, he planted [Number of White Oak trees on Day 2: 30] White Oak trees ([Number of White Oak trees on Day 1: 20] + 10) and [Number of Lodgepole Pine trees on Day 2: 50] Lodgepole Pine trees ([Number of Lodgepole Pine trees on Day 1: 40] + 1/4*[Number of Lodgepole Pine trees on Day 1: 40]). Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.


**Answer:**

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  Therefore, he planted a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day.  This means he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.  Therefore, he planted a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

The total number of trees planted over the two days is 60 (Day 1) + 80 (Day 2) = 140 trees.

Therefore, Mr. Julius planted a total of 140 trees in the two days.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"**Reformatted Question:**

John hires a driving service with a cost of [$2 per mile driven] and a [$150 per month bonus] for his daily commute.  His work is [30 miles away], requiring a round trip of [60 miles] each day. He works [5 days a week] for [50 weeks a year]. How much does he pay a year for driving?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day.  John's work is 30 miles away, and he travels there and back, making a round trip of 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.

Next, we determine the total miles driven per week. He works 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles per week.

Now, let's find the total miles driven per year. He works 50 weeks a year, resulting in 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles per year.

The cost per mile is $2, so the cost of mileage per year is 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000.

Finally, we calculate the yearly bonus cost.  He pays a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, making the total bonus cost $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800 per year.

Therefore, John's total yearly driving cost is the sum of the mileage cost and the bonus cost: $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The answer is {31800}.

He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. Originally, he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?","**Reformatted Question:**

Henry [baked cookies] for a baking competition. He [baked 15 more cookies than intended]. He [dropped 5 cookies]. He [now has 110 cookies]. He [wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year]. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?


**Answer:**

Henry currently has 110 cookies.  Before dropping 5, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies. Since he baked 15 more than intended, he originally intended to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.  He wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, meaning that 100 cookies is twice the number of cookies he baked last year. Therefore, Henry baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.

The answer is {50}.

He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","**Reformatted Question:**

Cameron arrives at a hotel in the Philippines at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.  The hotel charges [**1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay**] or [**1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay**]. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add [**70 pesos for every additional hour**].  He chooses to pay for the 12-hour stay and then add on 70 pesos per hour for the extra time instead of paying for a full 24-hour stay. How much money would Cameron save?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, let's calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay plus additional hourly charges.  The 12-hour stay costs [**1000 pesos**].  He stays for an additional 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours.  The cost of these extra 5 hours is 5 hours * [**70 pesos/hour**] = 350 pesos.  Therefore, his total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost if he had chosen the 24-hour stay option. This would cost [**1600 pesos**].

Finally, let's find the difference to determine his savings.  The difference between the 24-hour stay cost and the cost of the 12-hour stay plus additional hours is 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save **250 pesos** by choosing the 12-hour stay plus additional hourly charges option.

102,Ryan did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Ryan's allowance is `$6 per week` and he did his chores for `3 weeks`. He spent money on `ice cream cones` costing `$1.25 each` for himself and `3 friends`.  Movie tickets cost `$6.50 each`. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance.  He received `$6 per week` for `3 weeks`, so his total allowance is $6 * 3 = $18.

Next, let's figure out how much he spent on ice cream. He bought cones for himself and 3 friends, that's a total of 4 cones. Each cone cost `$1.25`, so he spent 4 * $1.25 = $5 on ice cream.

Now, let's subtract his ice cream expenses from his total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.  This is the amount of money Ryan has left.

Finally, let's see how many movie tickets he can buy. Each ticket costs `$6.50`.  Dividing his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.  Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

The answer is {2}.

After pouring chamomile and mint tea, she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","**Reformatted Question:**

Lana is brewing tea.  [Number of cups]: She has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows. [Tea types]: She brews chamomile, mint, and cinnamon tea. [Cinnamon tea]: 15 cups of cinnamon tea are brewed. [Equal distribution]:  In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.  [Question]: How many cups of mint tea are in each row?


**Answer:**

Lana starts with 27 cups of tea and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row initially contains 27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups.  She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, leaving 27 cups - 15 cups = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea.  Since she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, there are 12 cups / 2 tea types = 6 cups of each type (chamomile and mint) in total.  Finally, to find the number of mint tea cups in each row, we divide the total number of mint tea cups by the number of rows: 6 cups of mint tea / 3 rows = 2 cups of mint tea per row. Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.
"

Each pizza had [pizza_slices: 8] slices. Becky ate [becky_more_than_jake: 3] more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate [silvia_times_jake: twice] as many slices as Jake did. Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared [pizzas: 4] pizzas. If Becky ate [becky_slices: 10] slices, how many total slices did they eat?


**Answer:**

The problem states that Becky ate 10 slices.  Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake ([becky_more_than_jake: 3]), Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.  Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake ([silvia_times_jake: twice]), so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

In total, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31.  Note that the information about the number of pizzas ([pizzas: 4]) and slices per pizza ([pizza_slices: 8]) is not needed to solve this specific question, given that we already know how many slices each person ate.

Answer:

There are 8 rooms in Brianna's house.  Half the rooms (8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, for a total of 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, for a total of 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.  In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in Brianna's family, and each person has 1 flashlight, for a total of 4 flashlights.  Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and since there are 8 rooms, there are 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights in the rooms.  Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

With everything combined, Brianna's family is using 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56 candles and flashlights.

Therefore, the answer is {56}.

[Total Feed per Chicken]: Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day in three separate meals. [Flock Size]: Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day?


**Answer:**

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken receives a total of 3 cups of feed per day ([Total Feed per Chicken]).  Therefore, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed ([Morning Feed]), and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed ([Afternoon Feed]).  The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

To determine how much feed is needed for the final meal, subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily feed requirement: 60 cups (total) - 40 cups (morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","**Reformatted Question:**

Marcus is deciding if he needs to do his homework.  There's a [40% chance of an extension from the regular teacher], a [50% chance of a substitute teacher who won't collect homework], and a [20% chance of a personal extension if the regular teacher doesn't give an extension]. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?


**Answer:**

To find the chance Marcus has to turn in his homework, we need to calculate the probability of *not* getting an extension of any kind.

First, let's find the probability of *not* getting a class extension from the regular teacher:  100% - 40% = 60%.

Next, we need to consider the probability of the regular teacher being present *and* not giving a class extension. This is 60% (chance of no class extension) * 50% (chance of the regular teacher being present) = 30%.

Now, let's consider the probability of Marcus *not* getting a personal extension from the regular teacher, given that there was no class extension.  This is 80% (100% - 20%) chance of not getting a personal extension.

Therefore, the probability of Marcus needing to turn in his homework is the probability of the regular teacher being present and not giving a class extension AND Marcus not getting a personal extension, plus the probability of a substitute teacher being present and collecting homework.

The probability of the regular teacher being present, not giving a class extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension is 30% * 80% = 24%.

The probability of a substitute teacher being present and collecting homework is 50% (chance of a substitute) * 100% (substitute collects homework) = 50%.

Finally, we add the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events: 24% + 50% = 74%.

Therefore, there is a 74% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons.  [Trade Value 1: Large sticker = 1 large button OR 3 small buttons] [Trade Value 2: Small sticker = 1 small button] [Trade Value 3: Large button = 3 small stickers]. Lorraine starts with [Starting Inventory 1: 30 small stickers] and [Starting Inventory 2: 40 large stickers]. She trades [Trade Action 1: 50% of her large stickers for large buttons] and [Trade Action 2: the rest of her large stickers for small buttons]. She trades [Trade Action 3: 90% of her small stickers for large buttons]. How many buttons does she have by the end?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of large and small buttons Lorraine gets from her large stickers.

* **Large stickers traded for large buttons:** Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is (40 * 0.5) = 20 large stickers.  Using [Trade Value 1: Large sticker = 1 large button], this gives her 20 large buttons.

* **Large stickers traded for small buttons:** She trades the remaining (40 - 20) = 20 large stickers. Using [Trade Value 1: Large sticker = 3 small buttons], this gives her 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Next, let's calculate the number of large buttons she gets from her small stickers.

* **Small stickers traded for large buttons:** Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is (30 * 0.9) = 27 small stickers. Using [Trade Value 3: Large button = 3 small stickers], this means she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.

* **Total large buttons:** She has 20 large buttons (from large stickers) + 9 large buttons (from small stickers) = 29 large buttons.

* **Total small buttons:** She has 60 small buttons (from large stickers).

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, and we don't have a conversion rate between large and small buttons, we'll assume the question wants the total number of buttons regardless of size.  Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 29 + 60 = 89 buttons.

Therefore, the answer is {89}.

113,44 seniors need to receive awards.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Calculate the total cost of senior gifts, given that 44 seniors need awards, 2 seniors receive additional $5 pins, each senior receives a $20 picture frame with a 20% etching cost, 1/4 of the seniors (officers) receive $12 cords, and each picture frame costs $20.


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames.  Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the base cost is 44 * $20 = $880.  The etching adds an additional 20% to the cost of each frame, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4 per frame.  Therefore, the total etching cost is 44 * $4 = $176. The total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors receive pins costing $5 each, for a total pin cost of 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's determine the cost of the cords. One-fourth of the seniors (44 seniors / 4 = 11 seniors) are officers and receive cords.  The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on senior gifts: $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

Therefore, the total amount spent on senior gifts will be $1198.

**Answer:**

Mike initially had 5 pen pals but stopped corresponding with 2, leaving him with 3 active pen pals.  Each pen pal sends him 2 letters a week, each letter containing 5 pages.  This means Mike receives 3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal/week * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages per week from his pen pals.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages per week.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, so writing 30 pages takes him 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes/hour: 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing per week.

He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Toby is reading a [book length] 45-page book with an average of [words per page] 200 words per page.  His reading speed is [reading speed] 300 words per minute. It takes [travel time] 10 minutes to get to the airport. He needs to be at the airport in [total time] 60 minutes. How many minutes early will Toby be?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

* Total words = [book length] (pages) * [words per page] (words/page) = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, let's determine how long it takes Toby to read the book:

* Reading time = Total words / [reading speed] = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Finally, let's calculate how much time Toby has left after reading and traveling to the airport:

* Time remaining = [total time] - Reading time - [travel time] = 60 minutes - 30 minutes - 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

**The answer is {20}.**

A company had sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.,"**Reformatted Question:**

Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.  [Milk Purchase]  2/5 of the milk [Spoiled Milk Fraction] had passed its expiry date and was unsalvageable. [Unsalvageable Milk] He returned the spoiled milk to the company and received a refund. [Refund] Calculate how much he got in refunds. [Refund Amount]


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine the amount of milk that spoiled.  Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of that amount spoiled.  This is calculated as (2/5) * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons [Spoiled Milk Calculation].

Next, we need to find the cost of the spoiled milk.  Each gallon cost $3.5, so the total cost of the 1600 gallons of spoiled milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600 [Refund Calculation].

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)","**Reformatted Question:**

Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for [2 pounds of onions], and he likes to [double that amount]. The onions are on sale for [$2.00 a pound]. His soup [serves 6 people]. He also needs [2 boxes of beef stock], which are on sale for [$2.00 a box]. What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs:  He doubles the recipe amount, so he needs 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we determine the cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00

Then, we calculate the cost of the beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

Now, we find the total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

Finally, we calculate the cost per serving: $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Therefore, the cost per serving is $2.

Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  The [passion fruit cost] is $6 per pound, the [jackfruit cost] is $8 per pound, and the [honey cost] is $10 per pound.  He sells each [jar price] for $50.  To make 1 [jar] of the mixture it takes [passion fruit amount] 2 pounds of passion fruit and [jackfruit amount] 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes [honey amount] 2 pounds of special honey.  How much [profit] does he make selling 10 jars?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

* **Passion fruit cost:** [passion fruit amount] 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
* **Jackfruit cost:** [jackfruit amount] 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
* **Honey cost:** [honey amount] 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

The total cost of ingredients per jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Tim sells each jar for [jar price] $50, so his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by the number of jars: $6/jar * 10 jars = $60.

Therefore, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix.

In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?","**Reformatted Question:**

Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.  [Time Period: two weeks] [Rest Day: seventh day] [Travel Distance: first four days (200km/day), next two days (30% of first four days), second week (300km/day)]. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first four days: 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled in the next two days: 800 kilometers * 30% = 240 kilometers.

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in the first week (excluding the rest day): 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers = 1040 kilometers.

In the second week, Tom traveled for 7 days (14 days total - 7 days rest) at a rate of 300 kilometers per day: 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Finally, let's add the distances from both weeks to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip: 1040 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week trip.

120,"Glue sticks come in packs of 8. Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","**Reformatted Question:**

A fourth-grade class has [Number of Students: 27] students.  Each student needs [Glue Sticks per Student: 2] glue sticks. Glue sticks are sold in packs of [Glue Sticks per Pack: 8]. How many packs of glue sticks [Number of Packs Needed] must be purchased to ensure every student receives 2 glue sticks, given that only whole packs can be bought and extra glue sticks are acceptable?


**Answer:**

To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required.  Since there are [Number of Students: 27] students and each needs [Glue Sticks per Student: 2] glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Next, we determine how many packs are needed.  Each pack contains [Glue Sticks per Pack: 8] glue sticks.  Dividing the total number of glue sticks needed (54) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8), we get 54 / 8 = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he cannot buy a fraction of a pack.  Therefore, he must round up to the nearest whole number.  Rounding 6.75 up gives 7 packs.  This ensures that every student will receive their 2 glue sticks, and Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy [Number of Packs Needed: 7] packs of glue sticks.

122,There are 3 classes. Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"**Reformatted Question:**

There are 3 classes.  Each class in a school has 20 students. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls.  How many boys are in the third class?


**Answer:**

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are 60 students * 0.5 = 30 boys in the school.

The number of girls in the first two classes is 15 girls + 12 girls = 27 girls.

The total number of girls in the school is 60 students * 0.5 = 30 girls.

Therefore, the number of girls in the third class is 30 girls (total) - 27 girls (first two classes) = 3 girls.

The number of boys in the third class is the total number of students in the third class minus the number of girls in the third class: 20 students - 3 girls = 17 boys.

Therefore, there are 17 boys in the third class.

123,Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate \u00be of their pizzas. Each pizza had 12 slices. How many slices of pizza were left?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Bryce and four friends [Number of people] each ordered pizzas [Pizza quantity]. Bryce and two friends [Eaters group 1] ate 2/3 of their pizzas [Fraction eaten 1]. The two remaining friends [Eaters group 2] ate 1/2 of their pizzas [Fraction eaten 2]. Each pizza had 12 slices [Slices per pizza]. How many slices of pizza were left? [Question]


**Answer:**

There were a total of 5 pizzas ordered (Bryce and four friends).

* **Bryce and two friends:**  These three friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.  This means each of them ate (2/3) * 12 slices = 8 slices.  Since there are three friends in this group, they ate a total of 3 friends * 8 slices/friend = 24 slices.

* **The two remaining friends:** These two friends ate 1/2 of their pizzas. This means each ate (1/2) * 12 slices = 6 slices.  Together, they ate 2 friends * 6 slices/friend = 12 slices.

* **Total slices eaten:** The total number of slices eaten is 24 slices + 12 slices = 36 slices.

* **Total slices initially:** There were a total of 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

* **Slices remaining:** The number of slices remaining is 60 slices - 36 slices = 24 slices.

Therefore, there were 24 slices of pizza left.

James buys a plane costing [$150,000]. He pays [$5000] a month to rent a hanger and spends [twice as much] on fuel per month.  How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?


**Answer:**

The initial cost of the plane was [$150,000].  The monthly hanger rental cost is [$5000].  He spends twice this amount on fuel each month, which is 2 * [$5000] = [$10000].  Therefore, his total monthly cost for hanger rental and fuel is [$5000] + [$10000] = [$15000].

Over a year (12 months), his maintenance costs are [$15000/month] * 12 [months] = [$180000].

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost, the total cost for the first year is [$150,000] + [$180,000] = [$330,000].

James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter.  [Current Toys]: James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but [Additional Dogs]: there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. [Second Visit]: After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. [Third Visit]: When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. [Dog Toy Ratio]: Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?


**Answer:**

Let's break down James's toy acquisition step-by-step:

1. **Initial Need:** James starts with 4 toys and 4 dogs ([Current Toys]).  He gets 8 more dogs ([Additional Dogs]), meaning he needs 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

2. **Second Visit:**  After his first purchase, the number of dogs doubles ([Second Visit]).  This means there are now 12 + 12 = 24 dogs.  He needs 24 toys.

3. **Third Visit:** 3 dogs leave ([Third Visit]), reducing the number of dogs to 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.  He now needs 21 toys.

4. **Total Toys:**  Since each dog needs one toy ([Dog Toy Ratio]), James needs a total of 21 toys.  Note that the initial 4 toys are included in this total.

Therefore, the answer is {21}.

Tom plants [planting rate]10 trees a year[/planting rate]. He starts with [initial trees]50 trees[/initial trees]. After [time]10 years[/time], [tree death rate]30% of the trees die[/tree death rate]. Every year he also [chopping rate]chops down 2 trees a year[/chopping rate]. How many trees does he have left?

Answer:
First, let's calculate the total number of trees Tom plants over the [time]10 years[/time]: [planting rate]10 trees/year[/planting rate] * [time]10 years[/time] = 100 trees.

Next, let's find the total number of trees Tom has before any die: [initial trees]50 trees[/initial trees] + 100 trees = 150 trees.

Now, let's account for the trees that die after [time]10 years[/time]: 150 trees * [tree death rate]30%[/tree death rate] = 45 trees.  So, 150 trees - 45 trees = 105 trees remain.

Finally, let's consider the trees Tom [chopping rate]chops down[/chopping rate] each year: [chopping rate]2 trees/year[/chopping rate] * [time]10 years[/time] = 20 trees.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is: 105 trees - 20 trees = 85 trees.

The answer is {85}.

130,"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y.  [Number of goats in Farm X initially]: He has 55 goats in Farm X. [Number of goats in Farm Y initially]: He has 45 goats in Farm Y. [Goats sold from Farm X]: He sold 10 goats from Farm X. [Goats sold from Farm Y]: He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?


**Answer:**

Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X.  After selling 10 goats from Farm X, he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats remaining in Farm X.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, meaning he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.  He initially had 45 goats in Farm Y, so after selling 20, he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats remaining in Farm Y.

Therefore, the total number of goats left in both farms is 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats.

The answer is {70}.

John cuts down an [80-foot tree] and cuts it into [4-foot logs]. He can make logs out of [80%] of the tree. From each log, he cuts [5 planks], which he sells for [$1.2 each]. How much money does he make?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make.  Since he can use 80% of the [80-foot tree], he has 0.80 * 80 feet = 64 feet of usable wood.  Dividing this by the [4-foot log] length, we find he can make 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Next, we calculate the number of planks he can make.  Since he gets [5 planks] from each log, he makes 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, we calculate his earnings.  He sells each plank for [$1.2], so he makes 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96.

A muffaletta sandwich requires [1 pound of meat] and [1 pound of cheese] and serves [4 people]. Meat costs [$7.00 per pound] and cheese costs [$3.00 per pound].  How much money will Tyson spend on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches for [20 people]?


**Answer:**

To determine how much Tyson will spend, we need to first calculate the number of sandwiches needed.  Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, he needs 20 people / 4 people/sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, to make 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs 5 sandwiches * 1 pound meat/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat and 5 sandwiches * 1 pound cheese/sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat will be 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese will be 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.

The total cost of meat and cheese will be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, Tyson will spend $50.00 on meat and cheese.

At an Easter egg hunt, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs [Total Eggs] in the yard. Lamar finds 5 eggs [Lamar's Eggs]. Mei finds half as many as Charlie [Mei's Eggs, Charlie's Eggs]. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar [Stacy's Eggs]. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy [Charlie's Eggs, Stacy's Eggs]. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard [Remaining Eggs]?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid: 3 dozen eggs is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs [Total Eggs].

Next, we need to find out how many eggs were found.  We know Lamar found 5 eggs [Lamar's Eggs]. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs [Stacy's Eggs]. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, meaning Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs [Charlie's Eggs].  Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs [Mei's Eggs].

In total, the children found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs [Remaining Eggs].

Therefore, there are 9 eggs still hidden in the yard.

Given that each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each pound is 16 ounces, Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes if each box weighs 8 ounces?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine the number of boxes Nik needs.  He has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8 crayons per box.  Therefore, he needs 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes.

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and he has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes.  He has 25 boxes, and each box weighs 8 ounces.  So the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

The combined weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.  Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25 pounds.

Roger [buys coffee] at a store. He buys a week's worth of coffee, using [1 pound of coffee per day]. His usual coffee costs [$5 per pound], but it's sold out. He buys a more expensive brand that costs [20% more]. He also buys a [donut for $2].  How much did everything cost?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate how much coffee Roger bought.  He buys a week's worth, and uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he bought 1 pound/day * 7 days/week = 7 pounds of coffee.

Next, let's find the price of the more expensive coffee.  His usual coffee costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.  A 20% increase is 0.20 * $5 = $1.  Therefore, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now we can calculate the cost of the coffee: 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

Therefore, everything cost Roger $44.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?","**Reformatted Question:**

Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students.  [Number of size small students] = [Number of size medium students] - 4. [Number of size extra-small students] = 11. [Number of size large students] = [Number of size medium students] / 2. [Number of size extra-large students] = [Number of size large students] + 6. [Number of size small students] = 2 * [Number of size extra-small students]. Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the number of shirts needed for each size, using the information provided:

1. **Extra-small:** 11 students need extra-small shirts.

2. **Small:** Twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small shirts, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need small shirts.

3. **Medium:** Four less students need medium shirts than small shirts, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.

4. **Large:** Half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.

5. **Extra-large:** Six more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add the number of shirts needed for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts.

His total spending to date is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Today, he wants to buy one popcorn ($8) and one candy ($2), which will cost him $8 + $2 = $10.

This means his remaining budget is $150 (total budget) - $130 (spent) - $10 (today's snacks) = $10.

Since Friday tickets cost $10, he can afford to see **one more movie** today.

138,"Chad has a gift card for $5.00 that he uses at check out. He ordered a build-your-own burrito for lunch. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and 2 sauces for $0.25 each.  He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00 which will add chips and a drink.   How much does he still owe, if the base burrito is $6.50?","**Reformatted Question:**

Chad's Burrito Order:  [Cost Calculation]

Chad has a gift card for [$5.00 gift card]. He orders a build-your-own burrito with a [base burrito cost of $6.50]. He adds extra meat [$2.00 extra meat], extra cheese [$1.00 extra cheese], avocado [$1.00 avocado], and 2 sauces [$0.25 each sauce]. He upgrades his meal for [$3.00 upgrade] which includes chips and a drink. How much does he still owe?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito additions:

* Extra meat: $2.00
* Extra cheese: $1.00
* Avocado: $1.00
* 2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Total additions cost: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito before the upgrade:

* Base burrito: $6.50
* Total additions: $4.50
* Total cost before upgrade: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00

Now, let's add the upgrade cost:

* Total cost before upgrade: $11.00
* Upgrade cost: $3.00
* Total cost after upgrade: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Finally, let's subtract the gift card value from the total cost:

* Total cost: $14.00
* Gift card value: $5.00
* Amount still owed: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00.

139,"Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","**Reformatted Question:**

Tanya makes a salt scrub with [salt], [oil], [fragrance], [citrus zest], and [sugar].  She uses the same amount of [citrus zest] as [fragrance] ([zest = fragrance]). She uses the same amount of [salt] as [sugar] ([salt = sugar]). The total amount of scrub is 10 ounces. She uses twice as much [oil] as [salt] ([oil = 2 * salt]) and twice as much [salt] as [zest] ([salt = 2 * zest]). How many ounces of [oil] does she use?


**Answer:**

Let's use variables to represent the amounts of each ingredient:

* Let 'z' represent the ounces of citrus zest.
* Since the amount of citrus zest equals the amount of fragrance, fragrance = z.
* Since the amount of salt equals the amount of sugar, sugar = s.
* Since the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, salt (s) = 2z.
* Since the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, oil = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z.

The total amount of scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore:

oil + salt + sugar + zest + fragrance = 10 ounces

Substituting our variables and relationships:

4z + 2z + 2z + z + z = 10 ounces

Combining like terms:

10z = 10 ounces

Solving for z:

z = 1 ounce

Since the amount of oil is 4z, the amount of oil used is 4 * 1 ounce = 4 ounces.

Therefore, Tanya uses $\boxed{4}$ ounces of oil.

140,"Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?","**Reformatted Question:**

Given a 30-pound bag of soil, and the following plant requirements:
* Roses: 1 pound of soil per rose
* Sunflowers: 3 pounds of soil per sunflower
* Carnations: 1.5 pounds of soil per carnation

If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the amount of soil used for sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of soil used for carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

Now, let's find the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

Finally, let's determine how much soil is left for roses: 30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (soil used for sunflowers and carnations) = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.  Therefore, they can plant 3 roses.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Before its first stop, it had 20 people. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","**Reformatted Question:**

A bus, initially carrying 20 passengers [**Initial Passengers**], has a capacity of 200 people [**Bus Capacity**]. At the first stop, 40 people entered [**Stop 1 Passengers**]. At the second stop, 3/4 of the passengers from the first stop boarded [**Stop 2 Passengers**]. At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled [**Stop 3 Passengers**].  Calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus after the third stop.


**Answer:**

1. **Passengers after Stop 1:** The bus started with 20 passengers [**Initial Passengers**] and 40 more boarded at the first stop [**Stop 1 Passengers**], resulting in 20 + 40 = 60 passengers.

2. **Passengers after Stop 2:** At the second stop, (3/4) * 40 = 30 passengers boarded [**Stop 2 Passengers**].  Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90 passengers.

3. **Passengers after Stop 3:** At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled [**Stop 3 Passengers**], so there are now 90 * 2 = 180 passengers.

4. **Remaining Spaces:** The bus has a capacity of 200 people [**Bus Capacity**], and after the third stop, there are 180 passengers.  Therefore, the number of remaining spaces is 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.

142,"Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?","**Reformatted Question:**

Sasha [Player 1] and Julie [Player 2] are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams.  Two practice games are scheduled.  In game one, Sasha [Player 1, Home Court Advantage] scored 14 points [Game 1, Sasha Score]. Sasha [Player 1, Away Game] scored 6 fewer points in game two than Julie's [Player 2] score in game one [Game 2, Sasha Score, Game 1, Julie Score]. Julie [Player 2] scored 4 fewer points than Sasha [Player 1] in game one [Game 1, Julie Score, Game 1, Sasha Score]. How many total points did Sasha [Player 1] score during both games [Total Sasha Score]?


**Answer:**

First, we need to find Julie's score in the first game.  The question states that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. Sasha scored 14 points in the first game [Game 1, Sasha Score], so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points [Game 1, Julie Score].

Next, we find Sasha's score in the second game.  The question says Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game.  Julie scored 10 points in the first game [Game 1, Julie Score], so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game [Game 2, Sasha Score].

Finally, to find the total points Sasha scored, we add her scores from both games: 14 points (Game 1) + 4 points (Game 2) = 18 points [Total Sasha Score].

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.

144,"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?","**Reformatted Question:**

Kayla is having a birthday party at a movie theater.  [Number of classmates invited]: 25, [Number of dance class friends invited]: 7, [Number of family members invited]: 13, [Number of people who couldn't come]: 4.  [Theater rental fee for 20 people]: $125, [Additional guest fee]: $6 per guest. How much will the party cost?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited: 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = 45 people.

Next, subtract the number of people who couldn't make it: 45 invited - 4 unable to attend = 41 people attending.

Now, let's determine the additional guest fee.  Since the base rental fee covers 20 people, there are 41 attendees - 20 base attendees = 21 additional guests.

The cost for these additional guests is 21 additional guests * $6/guest = $126.

Finally, add the base rental fee and the additional guest fee to find the total cost: $125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guest fee) = $251.

Therefore, Kayla's birthday party will cost $251.

145,"Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","**Reformatted Question:**

Sasha has leftover lumber she wants to sell.  She has [ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards costing $10 each] and [five 4 x 4 x 10 boards costing $16 each]. Lumber prices have increased by [50%] since she bought the lumber. If she sells all the lumber at the current increased price, how much profit does she make?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Sasha's initial cost for the lumber.

* **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:** 10 boards * $10/board = $100
* **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:** 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* **Total initial cost:** $100 + $80 = $180

Next, we need to determine the current selling price of the lumber, considering the 50% price increase.

* **Increased price of 2x4x10 boards:** $10/board * 1.5 = $15/board
* **Increased price of 4x4x10 boards:** $16/board * 1.5 = $24/board

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the lumber at the increased prices.

* **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:** 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:** 5 boards * $24/board = $120
* **Total revenue:** $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, we can calculate Sasha's profit by subtracting her initial cost from her total revenue.

* **Profit:** $270 (total revenue) - $180 (total initial cost) = $90

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90 if she sells all her leftover lumber.

146,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Crista's plants [plant watering needs] need to be watered every day.  [8 plants] need 1 cup of water. She has [20 total plants]. [4 plants] need half a cup of water. The rest [remaining plants] need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine how many plants need a quarter cup of water. Crista has a total of 20 plants [20 total plants], and 8 need 1 cup [8 plants], and 4 need 1/2 cup [4 plants].  Therefore, the number of plants needing 1/4 cup is 20 - 8 - 4 = 8 plants [remaining plants].

Next, let's calculate the total water needed:

* Plants needing 1 cup: 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups [8 plants]
* Plants needing 1/2 cup: 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups [4 plants]
* Plants needing 1/4 cup: 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups [remaining plants]

Finally, let's add up the water needed for all the plants: 8 cups + 2 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.  The answer is {12}.

Caroline has 4 children.  The second child is two inches taller than the {first child}. The {first child} is 6 feet tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the {second child}. And the fourth child is three inches taller than the {third child}. How tall is the fourth child, in inches?


**Answer:**

First, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall.

Next, we find the height of the second child.  The question states the second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.

Now we find the height of the third child. The question says the third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, making the third child 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

Finally, we determine the height of the fourth child. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

A mechanic charges [$60] per truck tire and [$40] per car tire. On Friday, the mechanic repairs [12 car tires] and [0 truck tires]. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs [6 truck tires] and [4 car tires]. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the revenue on Thursday.  The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, generating 6 * $60 = $360.  Additionally, 4 car tires were repaired at $40 each, generating 4 * $40 = $160.  Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.

Next, let's calculate the revenue on Friday. The mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, generating 12 * $40 = $480. No truck tires were repaired on Friday, so there is no additional revenue from truck tire repairs.

Comparing the revenue from Thursday ($520) and Friday ($480), we see that Thursday had higher revenue.  The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

Marcel, a bicycle store owner, sold 300 bikes in a month.  [Total Bikes Sold]: 300  Half were Trekking bikes, [Trekking Bikes Percentage]: 50%, 15% were BMX bikes, [BMX Bikes Percentage]: 15%, and the rest were MTB bikes. [MTB Bikes Percentage]: Remaining Percentage.  MTB bikes cost $500 each, [MTB Price]: $500, BMX bikes cost half the price of an MTB, [BMX Price]: Half of MTB Price, and Trekking bikes cost $450 each. [Trekking Price]: $450. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month? [Total Earnings]: ?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

* **Trekking bikes:** Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 bikes * 50% = 150 Trekking bikes.
* **BMX bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, so he sold 300 bikes * 15% = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB bikes:** The remaining bikes were MTB bikes.  This is 300 bikes - 150 Trekking bikes - 45 BMX bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

* **MTB bikes:** 105 MTB bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
* **BMX bikes:** The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it costs $500/2 = $250.  He earned 45 BMX bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* **Trekking bikes:** He earned 150 Trekking bikes * $450/bike = $67,500

Finally, let's calculate Marcel's total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes

**Answer:**

First, let's determine the cost of a banana.  Since an apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange.  An orange costs three times as much as a banana, so an orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now we can calculate the cost of the fruits in the crate:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1/banana = $5
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.5/apple = $6
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3/orange = $21

She then accidentally released [half of the yellow balloons].  After arriving at school, she found [8 blue balloons] caught in a tree and added [75% of them] to her existing balloons. What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of red balloons Sally had after the wind burst some:

* 40% of 25 red balloons burst: 0.40 * 25 = 10 balloons
* Red balloons remaining: 25 - 10 = 15 balloons

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining after Sally accidentally released half:

* Half of 12 yellow balloons released: 12 / 2 = 6 balloons
* Yellow balloons remaining: 12 - 6 = 6 balloons

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally had before finding the blue balloons:

* Total balloons before finding blue balloons: 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) = 28 balloons

Finally, let's calculate the number of blue balloons Sally added to her collection:

He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","**Reformatted Question:**

A student has a school schedule with [6 periods a day], each [40 minutes long], for [5 days a week].  He also takes [2 extra classes a day]. He spends [1/16 of his weekly minutes] each on Saturday and Sunday for extra learning. How many hours a week does he spend learning?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total minutes spent in regular classes per day.  The student has 6 periods a day, each 40 minutes long, so that's 6 periods * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes of regular classes per day.

Next, we account for the extra classes. He takes 2 extra classes a day, each 40 minutes long, adding an additional 2 classes * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes per day.

Therefore, his total daily class time is 240 minutes + 80 minutes = 320 minutes.

Over the 5 weekdays, he spends 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes in class.

Now let's calculate his weekend study time.  First, we need to find the total weekly minutes spent learning before considering the weekend. This is 1600 minutes.

The total weekly minutes spent learning before the weekend is 1600 minutes.  He spends 1/16 of this time on each of Saturday and Sunday.  So, his weekend study time is (1/16) * 1600 minutes = 100 minutes per day.  Over the weekend, he spends 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

His total weekly learning time is 1600 minutes (weekday classes) + 200 minutes (weekend study) = 1800 minutes.

Finally, to convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes/hour: 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

Therefore, the student spends 30 hours a week learning.

**Answer:**

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.  He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

In total, Max bought 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.

If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","**Reformatted Question:**

Given that Mr. Bert drops the lowest score from the average of six tests, and Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on her first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to achieve a final average of 93?


**Answer:**

First, we identify Brinley's lowest test score among the first five tests.  The lowest score is 71.  Since Mr. Bert drops the lowest score, we will exclude this score from our calculations.

Next, we sum the remaining four scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Let 'x' represent the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.  To achieve a final average of 93, the sum of the four highest scores and the sixth test score, divided by 5 (since there are 5 scores after dropping the lowest), must equal 93.  This can be expressed as an equation:

(367 + x) / 5 = 93

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

367 + x = 465

Finally, we subtract 367 from both sides to isolate x:

x = 465 - 367 = 98

160,"A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","**Reformatted Question:**

A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.  [Day 3: Two bulk packs ordered, half a pack used, 78 bandages left]. [Day 2: 10 fewer bandages used than Day 1]. [Day 1: 38 bandages used, one bulk pack ordered]. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the bandage count day by day, working backwards from the end of the third day:

* **End of Day 3:** They had 78 bandages left.  They ordered two bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack (50/2 = 25 bandages).  Therefore, before ordering more bandages on Day 3, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

* **End of Day 2:**  They started Day 3 with 103 bandages. This means they used 100 - 103 = -3 bandages on Day 2. This is not possible, there must be an error in the problem statement.  Let's assume the problem meant to say they *had* 103 bandages *left* at the end of Day 2.

* **End of Day 2 (Corrected):** They started Day 3 with 103 bandages.  This means they used 100 - 103 = -3 bandages on Day 2. This is not possible, there must be an error in the problem statement.  Let's assume the problem meant to say they *had* 103 bandages *left* at the end of Day 2.  This is not possible.  The problem statement contains a contradiction.

* **Day 1:** They used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages). Therefore, they started Day 1 with 50 + 38 = 88 bandages.

**Conclusion:**

The problem statement contains a contradiction. The information provided about Day 2 and Day 3 is inconsistent.  However, based on the information given for Day 1, they started with **88** bandages.  The information about the remaining days needs correction to be solvable.

161,"Bill is ordering a new truck.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and any other features are at extra cost. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?","**Reformatted Question:**

What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, considering the [base price], the [king cab upgrade cost], the [leather seats cost] (one-third the king cab cost), the [running boards cost] ($500 less than leather seats), and the [upgraded exterior light package cost]?


**Answer:**

The base price of the truck is $30,000.  The king cab upgrade costs an extra $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.  The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, meaning they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. Finally, the upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

To find the total cost, we add all the costs together: $30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior lights) = $43,500.

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

162,"Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?","**Reformatted Question:**

Steve's biking speed: 440 feet/minute
Steve's distance from school: 3 miles
Tim's skateboarding speed: 264 feet/minute
Tim's distance from school: 2 miles
Question: How long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?


**Answer:**

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet.  There are 5280 feet in a mile.

* Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes each person to get home:

* Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
* Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will arrive home first.  The difference in their arrival times is:

* Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, Steve will be waiting 4 minutes at his house before Tim arrives.

The answer is {4}.

163,It takes Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Julia rows at a rate of [rowing_rate] twenty feet in [rowing_time] sixteen seconds.  Her boat leaks at a rate of [leak_rate] two liters of water per ten feet rowed. The shore is [distance_time] 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds.  We know from the problem that Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds ([rowing_rate], [rowing_time]).  To find her speed in feet per second, we divide the distance by the time: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Next, we calculate the total distance Julia rowed in 64 seconds ([distance_time]) by multiplying her speed by the time: 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Now we determine how much water leaked into the boat. The boat leaks at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet ([leak_rate]).  To find the total amount of water leaked, we set up a proportion:

(2 liters / 10 feet) = (x liters / 80 feet)

Solving for x, we get: x = (2 liters * 80 feet) / 10 feet = 16 liters.

Therefore, by the time Julia reached shore, her boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

When Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","**Reformatted Question:**

Gissela's truck [Gissela's capacity]: 4,000 pounds
Gordy's truck [Gordy's capacity]: 800 pounds more than Gissela's
Combined capacity [Total capacity]: 11,600 pounds
Gary's truck [Gary's capacity]: ?

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?


**Answer:**

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, meaning Gordy's capacity is 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.  The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.  Since the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds (Total capacity), Gary's truck must carry the remaining weight: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.  Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

165,"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","**Reformatted Question:**

A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure.  [Number of holes dug Day 1]: They dug ten holes the first day. [Number of holes dug Day 2]: thirteen holes the second day. [Number of holes dug Day 3]: eight holes the third day (minus two filled in). [Relationship between Day 1 and Day 4 holes]: The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.  [Treasure found Day 4]: On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?


**Answer:**

The pirates dug ten holes on the first day ([Number of holes dug Day 1]).  At the end of the fourth day, there were four times as many holes as on the first day ([Relationship between Day 1 and Day 4 holes]), meaning there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the holes dug on the previous days.  On the second day, they dug thirteen holes ([Number of holes dug Day 2]). On the third day, they dug eight holes, but filled in two, resulting in a net increase of 8 - 2 = 6 holes ([Number of holes dug Day 3]).

Therefore, the total number of holes dug before the fourth day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 30 holes.

Since there were 40 holes at the end of the fourth day, and 30 holes were dug on the previous days, the pirates dug 40 - 30 = 10 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The answer is {10}.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mr. Robles' first monkey eats [monkey1_bananas]10 bananas[/monkey1_bananas] each day. Mr. Robles buys [total_bananas]315 bananas[/total_bananas], which is enough to feed his three monkeys for [duration]a week[/duration] ([days_in_week]7 days[/days_in_week]). The second monkey eats [difference]4 more bananas[/difference] than the first monkey, and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week.  Mr. Robles bought [total_bananas]315 bananas[/total_bananas] that last for [duration]a week[/duration] ([days_in_week]7 days[/days_in_week]), so the total number of bananas eaten per week is 315.

Next, let's determine how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week. The first monkey eats [monkey1_bananas]10 bananas[/monkey1_bananas] per day, so in a week ([days_in_week]7 days[/days_in_week]), it eats 10 * 7 = 70 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the number of bananas the second monkey eats per day and per week. The second monkey eats [difference]4 more bananas[/difference] than the first monkey, meaning it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.  In a week, it eats 14 * 7 = 98 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas: 315 - 70 - 98 = 147 bananas.

Finally, to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total for the third monkey by the number of days in a week: 147 / 7 = 21 bananas.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Sean is preparing for a theater production.  He needs to memorize lines for two scenes and lyrics for a solo song.  The song has `<fact1>54 lines</fact1>`. Scene two has `<fact2>six more lines than the song</fact2>`, and `<fact3>four-fifths</fact3>` of these are Sean's lines. Scene one has `<fact4>twice the number of lines as the song</fact4>`, but only `<fact5>one-third</fact5>` are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize in total?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of lines in each part Sean needs to memorize:

* **Song:** The song has `<fact1>54 lines</fact1>`.  Sean needs to memorize all of these.

* **Scene Two:** Scene two has 54 + <fact2>6</fact2> = 60 lines. Sean needs to memorize (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from this scene.

* **Scene One:** Scene one has 2 * <fact1>54</fact1> = 108 lines. Sean needs to memorize (1/3) * 108 = 36 lines from this scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize, we add the lines from each part:

Total lines = Song lines + Scene Two lines + Scene One lines = 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines

Therefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","**Reformatted Question:**

Given that:

* [Hamster Straw]: 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
* [Rat Straw]: Rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
* [Rabbit Straw]: 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
* [Total Straw]: 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents (hamsters and rats).

How many rats are in each cage?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the amount of straw used for the hamsters.  Since there are [Hamster Straw] 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, a total of 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces of straw were used for the hamsters.

Next, we subtract the straw used for hamsters from the total straw used for small rodents to find the amount of straw used for the rats: [Total Straw] 160 pieces - 50 pieces = 110 pieces of straw for rats.

Now, we know that each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. To find the total number of rats, we divide the total straw for rats by the straw per rat: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.  Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, there must be an error in the problem statement or some straw was not accounted for.  Let's assume the total straw for small rodents is slightly off and recalculate.

Let's assume there was a slight error in the total straw count.  If we assume that the total straw for small rodents is 114 instead of 160, then the calculation would be: 114 - 50 = 64 pieces of straw for rats.  64 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 10.66 rats. This is still not a whole number.

Let's assume the total straw for small rodents is 114 instead of 160. Then: 114 - 50 = 66 pieces of straw for rats. 66 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 11 rats.

Since there are [Rat Straw] 3 cages of rats, and we have 11 rats, we can't have an equal number of rats in each cage.  There is likely an error in the problem statement.  If we assume 12 rats, then there would be 4 rats per cage (12 rats / 3 cages = 4 rats/cage).  This would require 72 pieces of straw for the rats (12 rats * 6 pieces/rat = 72 pieces), leaving 160 - 72 - 50 = 38 pieces of straw unaccounted for.

**Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no consistent solution for the number of rats in each cage.** The problem statement likely contains an error.

And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?","**Reformatted Question:**

Grandpa's Jelly Bean Consumption:

* **Key Phrase 1:** 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up.
* **Key Phrase 2:** 3 small beans = 1 medium bean.
* **Key Phrase 3:**  Twice as many medium beans as large beans.
* **Target Question:** How many small beans can Grandpa eat?


**Answer:**

We know from **Key Phrase 1** that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

From **Key Phrase 3**, we learn that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans.  Therefore, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized jelly beans.

**Key Phrase 2** tells us the conversion rate between small and medium beans: 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium bean.  To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium beans, we multiply: 150 medium beans * 3 small beans/medium bean = 450 small beans.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

**Answer:**

Let's break down Erika's finances to determine how much money she initially had in her purse:

1. **Laptop Cost After Trade-in:** The laptop costs $600, but the trade-in reduces the price by $200, making the final cost $600 - $200 = $400.

2. **Money Received:** Erika receives $80 from her mom and $150 from her part-time job, totaling $80 + $150 = $230.

3. **Money Needed:** Erika still needs $50 to buy the laptop.

4. **Money Already Had:**  The total cost of the laptop after the trade-in is $400.  Erika received $230 from her mom and job.  Therefore, the amount she already had in her purse is $400 (final cost) - $230 (received) - $50 (still needed) = $120.

Therefore, Erika had $120 in her purse initially.

[Fastest Car Speed] Rani is obsessed with sports cars.  [Average Car Speed] The average car can go 120 mph. [Second Fastest Car Speed] The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. [Second Fastest Car Speed Relative to Average] The second fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.  [Question] How fast does the faster car go?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine the speed of the second fastest car.  The question states that ""[Second Fastest Car Speed Relative to Average] The second fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car,"" and the ""[Average Car Speed] average car can go 120 mph."" Therefore, the second fastest car's speed is 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph.

Next, we find the speed of the fastest car. The problem says that ""[Second Fastest Car Speed] The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car,"" which we calculated to be 600 mph.  So, the fastest car's speed is 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph.

Therefore, the fastest car goes 750 mph.

James [salesperson] gets a 10% [commission rate] commission on the profits [profit calculation]. He sold 10 [number of cars] cars that cost $25,000 [car cost] each. The company paid 30% [acquisition cost percentage] of the price to acquire the cars [acquisition cost]. How much did he make [James' earnings]?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine the company's cost to acquire each car.  The company paid 30% of the $25,000 car cost, which is 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Next, we calculate the profit per car.  This is the selling price ($25,000) minus the acquisition cost ($7,500), resulting in a profit of $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 per car.

James sold 10 cars, so the total profit is 10 cars * $17,500/car = $175,000.

Finally, we calculate James' commission. He receives 10% of the total profit, which is 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

**Answer:**

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.  Megan's dog walking took 2 hours longer than Amalia's lawn mowing, so Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours. Dior's laundry took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4-hour lawn mowing.  While the exact time isn't specified beyond ""well over 4 hours,"" we know it was at least 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Therefore, the total time for all chores is at least 4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = 18 hours.  The actual total time could be more than 18 hours, depending on exactly how much longer than 4 hours Dior's laundry took.  However, the minimum total time is $\boxed{18}$ hours.

Next, let's find the total cost before the discount:

* **Total before discount:** $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:

* **Discount amount:** $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price Daniel has to pay:

* **Total cost after discount:** $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?","**Reformatted Question:**

Annabelle has a first job paying [$10/hour] for [20 hours] of work and a second job paying [$5/hour] for [15 hours] of work.  She already has [$80] in savings and wants to buy a phone costing [$400]. How much more money does she need to save?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Annabelle's earnings from her first job: [$10/hour] * [20 hours] = $200.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from her second job: [$5/hour] * [15 hours] = $75.

Now, let's find her total earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275.

Adding her existing savings, her total money is: $275 + [$80] = $355.

Finally, let's determine how much more money she needs: [$400] (phone cost) - $355 (total money) = $45.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?","**Reformatted Question:**

Lucy sells apples at [$4 per piece]. On Monday, she sold all the apples she picked. On Tuesday, she picked [12 apples]. On Wednesday, she picked [double the number of apples] she picked on Tuesday. If Lucy got [$56] from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?


**Answer:**

First, let's determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday.  Since she sells apples at $4 per piece and earned $56 on Monday, she must have picked $56 / $4/piece = 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know she picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which is 12 apples * 2 = 24 apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 14 apples (Monday) + 12 apples (Tuesday) + 24 apples (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The answer is {50}.

**Answer:**

We are given that Martin's weight is 55 kg.  The problem states that Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. Therefore, Carl weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

Next, we know that Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.  This means Christian weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

Finally, the problem states that Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.  Therefore, Harry weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

The weight of Harry is {74} kg.

At Mrs. Smith's garden, there are 100 plants in total.  [Total Plants: 100] One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. [Indoor Plants: 1/4 of total] Among the plants that are not indoor plants, two-thirds are outdoor plants [Outdoor Plants: 2/3 of (Total - Indoor Plants)], and the rest are flowering plants. [Flowering Plants: Remaining after Indoor and Outdoor Plants are accounted for] What percent of the plants are flowering plants?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the number of indoor plants:

* One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants: (1/4) * 100 = 25 indoor plants

Next, let's find the number of plants that are *not* indoor plants:

* Total plants minus indoor plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants

Now, let's determine the number of outdoor plants:

* Two-thirds of the non-indoor plants are outdoor plants: (2/3) * 75 = 50 outdoor plants

Finally, let's calculate the number of flowering plants:

* Non-indoor plants minus outdoor plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

* (25 flowering plants / 100 total plants) * 100% = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.   How much will this cost her?","**Reformatted Question:**

Angela needs to have the following items installed/hung:  `6 mirrors`, `2 chandeliers`, `20 pictures`. An interior design firm offers an installation package for `$129.00`, which includes: `4 mirrors`, `2 shelves`, `1 chandelier`, and `10 pictures`.  Additional items cost `$15.00` each. How much will the total installation cost be for Angela?


**Answer:**

The interior design firm's package includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. Let's calculate the additional items needed:

* **Mirrors:** Angela needs 6 mirrors, and the package includes 4, so she needs an additional 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela needs 2 chandeliers, and the package includes 1, so she needs an additional 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
* **Pictures:** Angela needs 20 pictures, and the package includes 10, so she needs an additional 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

In total, Angela needs 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items.  The cost of these additional items is 13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00.

The total cost will be the cost of the package plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $324.00.

Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. The bedrooms measure 20 by 12 feet each.  What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?  [house area, bedroom area, living room area, total area calculation]


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:

* One bedroom area: 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of all bedrooms is:

* Total bedroom area: 4 bedrooms * 240 square feet/bedroom = 960 square feet

Next, let's find the area of the living room:

* Living room area: 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet

Now, we know that the rest of the house (excluding bedrooms and the living room) is 1000 square feet.  Therefore, the total area of the house is the sum of the bedroom area, the living room area, and the area of the rest of the house:

* Total house area: 960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest of house) = 3160 square feet

Therefore, the total area of Tom's house is 3160 square feet.

186,Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Tim [buys fireworks] costing [$400] and another pack costing [twice that much]. He receives a [20% discount] on these fireworks. He also buys a [finale firework] costing [$150].  How much did he spend in total?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the second firework pack.  The question states it cost ""twice that much"" as the first pack, which cost $400. Therefore, the second pack cost 2 * $400 = $800.

Next, we find the total cost of both firework packs *before* the discount: $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, we apply the 20% discount.  A 20% discount means he paid 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.  So the discounted cost of the two packs is 0.80 * $1200 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","**Reformatted Question:**

Suzie bought four packs of gum for $7.  Two packs were strawberry, one pack was grape ($2), and one pack was green apple (half the price of the grape gum). How many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the cost of the green apple gum.  The question states Suzie paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, which cost $2. Therefore, the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

Next, let's find the total cost of the grape and green apple gum.  This is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3.

Now, let's find the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum.  Suzie spent a total of $7, and $3 was spent on the grape and green apple gum.  Therefore, she spent $7 - $3 = $4 on the strawberry gum.

Finally, since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $\boxed{$2}$.

Mark buys 3 packs of old magic cards at $1800 each.  Each pack contains one $4000 card, one $1000 card, and 30 cards averaging $50 each.  How much profit did Mark make?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Mark's total cost. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so his total cost was 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Next, let's calculate his total revenue. He received one card worth $4000 and another worth $1000.  Additionally, he had 30 cards averaging $50 each, generating 30 * $50 = $1500.  His total revenue is therefore $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

Finally, to find his profit, we subtract his total cost from his total revenue: $6500 (total revenue) - $5400 (total cost) = $1100.

Therefore, Mark made a profit of $1100.

Elaine initially had [Initial Cards: 20] Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected [Month 1 Collection: three times that number]. In the third month, she collected [Month 3 Collection: twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months]. In the second month, she collected [Month 2 Collection: 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month]. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month.  She collected three times her initial amount, which was [Initial Cards: 20] cards.  Therefore, she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards in the first month.

Next, let's find out how many cards she collected in the second month.  She collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month ([Month 1 Collection: 60 cards]), so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month.

Now, let's determine the number of cards she collected in the third month.  She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months ([Month 1 Collection: 60 cards] + [Month 2 Collection: 40 cards] = 100 cards).  So, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards in the third month.

Finally, to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we add up her initial amount and the cards collected in each month: [Initial Cards: 20] + [Month 1 Collection: 60] + [Month 2 Collection: 40] + [Month 3 Collection: 200] = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokemon cards.

The second train arrives [Time2: half an hour after the first leaves], stays for [Duration2: a quarter of the first train's duration]. The third train arrives [Time3: an hour after the second leaves], leaves immediately upon arrival [Duration3: 0 minutes]. The fourth train arrives [Time4: 20 minutes after the third leaves]. How long will Paul wait?


**Answer:**

Let's break down the arrival and departure times of each train:

1. **First Train:** Arrives in 10 minutes, departs after 20 minutes (10 + 20 = 30 minutes from now).

2. **Second Train:** Arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves (30 + 30 = 60 minutes from now). It stays for a quarter of the first train's duration, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.  It departs at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes from now.

3. **Third Train:** Arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves (65 + 60 = 125 minutes from now). It departs immediately, so it leaves at 125 minutes from now.

4. **Fourth Train:** Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (125 + 20 = 145 minutes from now). This is the train Paul is waiting for.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes.

They have <fact3>3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars</fact3>. If the rink has <fact4>75 cars in total</fact4>, how many yellow cars do they have?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the number of green cars.  The rink has <fact2>2 fewer green cars than the 12 red cars</fact2>, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Next, let's determine the number of blue cars. The rink has <fact3>3 times the number of blue cars as green cars</fact3>, meaning they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 red cars + 10 green cars + 30 blue cars = 52 cars.

Finally, to find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the <fact4>total number of cars in the rink (75)</fact4>: 75 total cars - 52 cars = 23 yellow cars.

**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Since Rita removed twice as many Junebugs on those days as she did on Monday ([39 Junebugs]), she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on each of those days.

Next, we calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

* Monday: 39 Junebugs
* Tuesday: 78 Junebugs
* Wednesday: 78 Junebugs
* Thursday: 48 Junebugs
* Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total Junebugs: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Finally, to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:

Average Junebugs per day: 300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.

Larry loves taking care of animals. He has [fact1: 3 cats]. He has [fact2: 3 times as many dogs as cats]. He has [fact3: 2 fewer rabbits than dogs]. He also has a collection of gerbils that's [fact4: 1/3 the number of fish] he has. He has a fish tank with [fact5: three times the number of fish as rabbits]. How many pets does Larry have?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the number of dogs Larry has.  From [fact2: 3 times as many dogs as cats], and knowing he has [fact1: 3 cats], he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, let's determine the number of rabbits.  [fact3: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs], so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now let's calculate the number of fish.  [fact5: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits], meaning he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Finally, let's find the number of gerbils.  [fact4: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish], so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of cats, dogs, rabbits, fish, and gerbils: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.

Therefore, Larry has a total of 47 pets.

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts.  Because of the ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal on T-shirts, Jake pays full price for one T-shirt ($8) and half price for the second T-shirt ($8 * 0.50 = $4).  Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off their original price of $40, meaning the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.  So, Jake pays $40 - $16 = $24 for the shoes.

Finally, to find the total amount Jake spends, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, Jake spends a total of $36 at the store.

2. **School trip:** He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. **Giving to friends:** He gives 14 lollipops to his friends at school: 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. **Buying lollipops:** He buys twice the number he gave to his friends (14 * 2 = 28 lollipops): 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. **Eating at night:** He eats 3 lollipops that night: 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. **Eating in the morning:** He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has a total of 31 lollipops.

Of the people who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. How many people accept the position?","**Reformatted Question:**

100 people apply for a job at Google.  [Applicants: 100] Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. [Interview Rate: 30%] Of the people who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. [Acceptance Rate: 33%] Of the people who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. [Job Offer Rate: 20%] How many people accept the position?


**Answer:**

First, let's find out how many people received interviews:

* Number of interviewees = Total applicants * Interview Rate = 100 * 30% = 30 people

Next, let's determine how many people received job offers:

* Number of job offers = Number of interviewees * Job Offer Rate = 30 * 20% = 6 people

Finally, let's calculate how many people accepted the job offer:

* Number of people accepting the position = Number of job offers * Acceptance Rate = 6 * (1/3) = 2 people

Therefore, 2 people accepted the position.

200,"Mr. Rogers sold a watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it.  The watch was originally $2000, but was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mr. Rogers bought a watch at 75% of its original price of $2000. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price of $2000?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.  The question states the watch was originally $2000, but Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.  Therefore, he paid 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Next, we need to find the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. The question says he sold it at 120% of the price he bought it.  So, he sold it for 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.

Finally, to determine the percentage discount Mr. Roger's friend received, we compare the price the friend paid ($1800) to the original price ($2000). The discount amount is $2000 - $1800 = $200.  To express this as a percentage, we divide the discount amount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.

Therefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

201,"James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He swims 60% of the distance. He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","**Reformatted Question:**

James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a [distance]20-mile lake[/distance]. He swims [percentage]60%[/percentage] of the distance. He can swim at a [speed1]pace of 2 miles per hour[/speed1]. After that, he stops on an island and rests for [rest_time]half as long as the swimming time[/rest_time]. He then finishes the [remaining_distance]remaining distance[/remaining_distance] while going [speed2]half the speed[/speed2]. How long did it take him to get across the lake?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the distance James swam before resting.  He swam [percentage]60%[/percentage] of the [distance]20-mile lake[/distance], which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

Next, we determine how long it took him to swim this distance.  His swimming [speed1]pace is 2 miles per hour[/speed1], so it took him 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.

His rest time on the island was [rest_time]half as long as the swimming time[/rest_time], which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance.  He had already swum 12 miles, so the [remaining_distance]remaining distance[/remaining_distance] is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

His speed for the remaining distance was [speed2]half the speed[/speed2] of his initial pace, which is 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour.  Therefore, it took him 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance.

Finally, to find the total time, we add up the swimming time, rest time, and the time to finish the remaining distance: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Therefore, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is {17}.

202,"Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\""  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  How much money does Sally have left?","**Reformatted Question:**

Sally went to the seashore for vacation. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She scooped up 2 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted. How much money does Sally have left?

**Key Phrases:**

* Taffy sale: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off""
* Taffy quantity: 2 pounds
* Seashells cost: $1.50
* Magnets cost: 4 magnets at $0.25 each
* Initial money: $10


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy.  The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""  This means the first pound costs $3.00, and the second pound costs $3.00 / 2 = $1.50.  Therefore, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3.00 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets.  Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's find the total cost of Sally's purchases.  This is the cost of the taffy ($4.50) plus the cost of the seashells ($1.50) plus the cost of the magnets ($1.00): $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Finally, let's determine how much money Sally has left.  She started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, so she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

203,"Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","**Reformatted Question:**

Mark is choosing between two party venues.  [Venue 1 Cost]: Venue 1 has a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. [Venue 2 Cost]: Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, with food included.  [Equal Cost]: How many guests are necessary for the total cost of Venue 1 to equal the total cost of Venue 2?


**Answer:**

Let's represent the number of guests as 'x'.

* **Venue 1 Cost:** The total cost for Venue 1 is the flat fee plus the cost of food per guest: $200 + $5x

* **Venue 2 Cost:** The total cost for Venue 2 is the cost per guest: $25x

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two cost equations equal to each other and solve for x:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the total cost of Venue 1 to equal the total cost of Venue 2.

204,"A farmer is baling hay in their field. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?","**Reformatted Question:**

A farmer bales hay at a rate of [5 bales/hour], and a truck removes hay at a rate of [3 bales/hour].  If both work for [6 hours], how many bales remain in the field?


**Answer:**

The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour, and works for 6 hours.  Therefore, the farmer produces 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales of hay.

The truck removes 3 bales of hay per hour, and works for 6 hours. Therefore, the truck removes 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales of hay.

The number of bales remaining in the field is the difference between the number of bales produced and the number of bales removed: 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

Therefore, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

At the Science Center, [Monday visits]: 32 classes, [Tuesday visits]: twice the number of Monday visits, [Wednesday visits]: three times the number of Monday visits, [Thursday visits]: 30 classes, [Friday visits]: 25 classes.  In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the number of classes that visited on Tuesday.  Since twice as many classes visited on Tuesday as on Monday, and 32 classes visited on Monday, then 32 classes * 2 = 64 classes visited on Tuesday.

Next, we calculate the number of classes that visited on Wednesday.  Since three times as many classes visited on Wednesday as on Monday, and 32 classes visited on Monday, then 32 classes * 3 = 96 classes visited on Wednesday.

Now we sum the number of classes that visited each day: 32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247 classes.

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","**Reformatted Question:**

Rory retrieved tennis balls in three sets.  In the third set [Set 3], he retrieved half as many balls as in the second [Set 2]. He retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls [Total Balls]. In the first set [Set 1], he retrieved four more balls than in the second set [Set 2]. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set [Set 1]?


**Answer:**

Let's use variables to represent the number of balls retrieved in each set:

* Let 'x' be the number of balls retrieved in Set 2.
* Set 3: x/2  (half as many as Set 2)
* Set 1: x + 4 (four more than Set 2)

The total number of balls retrieved is 19 [Total Balls]:

x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19

Now we solve for x:

2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in Set 2.

Now we can find the number of balls retrieved in Set 1 [Set 1]:

Set 1 = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.  The answer is {10}.

Earlier, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?","**Reformatted Question:**

Greta's Birthday Brownies:  [Brownie Batch Size] Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. [Friend's Brownies] Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies. [Brownies Eaten] 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten at the surprise party. [Office Brownies] Greta received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office party. [Leftover Brownies] How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had.  She initially had 1 dozen (12) brownies from her own batch.  Her friends contributed 4 dozen (4 * 12 = 48) brownies.  She also received 1/2 dozen (12/2 = 6) brownies from her office party.  Therefore, the total number of brownies was 12 + 48 + 6 = 66 brownies.

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten at the surprise party.  1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18 brownies (12 + 6 = 18).

Finally, to find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

A makeup artist charges Jean [$250/hour]. The artist works [6 hours/day] for [4 days/week] using expensive makeup for a movie that takes [5 weeks] to film.  After filming, Jean receives a [10%] discount. How much did Jean pay?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total hours the makeup artist worked:

* Hours per day: 6 hours
* Days per week: 4 days
* Total hours per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
* Total weeks: 5 weeks
* Total hours worked: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, let's calculate the initial cost before the discount:

* Hourly rate: $250/hour
* Total hours: 120 hours
* Initial cost: $250/hour * 120 hours = $30,000

Finally, let's apply the 10% discount:

* Discount percentage: 10%
* Discount amount: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000
* Final cost after discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000.

* Tuesday: `[Tuesday_sales: 15 crates]`
* Wednesday: `[Wednesday_sales: 12 crates]`
* Thursday: `[Thursday_sales: 18 crates]`
* Weekend: `[weekend_sales: 20 crates]`

His total sales are 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

His target for the week was `[target: 120 crates]`.

Therefore, Sam was off his target by 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

[CD Burner Cost] A CD burner costs €74. [Printer Cost] A printer costs €102.  [Question] How much money will she have left after buying the computer and accessories?


**Answer:**

To determine how much money Elvira will have left for clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from her budget.

1. **Total cost of accessories:**  The scanner (€157), CD burner (€74), and printer (€102) cost a total of €157 + €74 + €102 = €333.

2. **Total cost of computer and accessories:** The computer (€1090) plus the accessories (€333) cost a total of €1090 + €333 = €1423.

3. **Money left for clothing:** Elvira's budget (€1500) minus the total cost of her purchases (€1423) leaves her with €1500 - €1423 = €77.

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for clothing.

Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.  At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?","**Reformatted Question:**

At the start of a water balloon fight, Maria had [Maria's initial balloons: 1] water balloon.  Her mom gave each person [balloons from mom: 3] more balloons. Maria then gave each of her [number of friends: 4] friends [balloons given to friends: 2] water balloons. How many total balloons did the girls have in the end?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons after Maria's mom's contribution.  There are 5 girls total (Maria + 4 friends).  Each girl received 3 additional balloons from Maria's mom, so that's 5 girls * 3 balloons/girl = 15 balloons.

Next, we need to account for the balloons Maria gave to her friends. She gave away 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:

* Maria's initial balloon: 1 balloon
* Balloons from mom: 15 balloons
* Total balloons before Maria gave any away: 1 + 15 = 16 balloons
* Balloons given away by Maria: 8 balloons
* Total balloons remaining: 16 balloons - 8 balloons = 8 balloons

Therefore, after Maria gave balloons to her friends, the girls had a total of 8 balloons.  However, the question asks for the total number of balloons *in the end*.  Since the problem doesn't state that any balloons broke or were otherwise lost, the total number of balloons remains 8.  The answer is {8}.

If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?


**Answer:**

Cedar Falls Middle School has four grades (4–7).  Ten students from each grade are selected to participate in the escape room, resulting in 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students total.

Only 8 students can participate in the escape room at one time.  Therefore, the number of groups needed is 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

Each group uses 45 minutes.  Therefore, the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

Billy's first raise: [$0.50/hour] (after 2 months)
Billy's second raise: [$1.00/hour] (after 1 year)
Hours worked: [20 hours]

How much more money will Billy earn than Sally in 20 hours?


**Answer:**

To determine how much more Billy earns than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly rates after the specified time period and then calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

First, let's calculate Billy's hourly rate after his raises.  His starting rate was $10/hour. After 2 months, he received a $0.50/hour raise, bringing his rate to $10.50/hour. After one year, he received another $1.00/hour raise, resulting in a final hourly rate of $11.50/hour.

Sally's starting hourly rate was $10.50/hour, and she did not receive any raises.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

* **Billy's earnings:** $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230
* **Sally's earnings:** $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210

Finally, let's find the difference in their earnings:

* **Difference:** $230 - $210 = $20

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally if both work 20 hours.

The answer is {20}.

A lemon tree costs [$90] to plant.  Each year it grows [7 lemons], which sell for [$1.5] each.  Annual costs for watering and feeding are [$3]. How many years will it take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree?


**Answer:**

Here's how to determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree:

1. **Annual Lemon Income:** Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.50 in revenue.

2. **Annual Net Profit:**  Subtracting the annual costs, Carlos's net profit each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

3. **Years to Recover Initial Cost:** To recover the initial $90 planting cost, Carlos needs to generate $90 / $7.50/year = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning a profit from his lemon tree.

They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy a birthday gift for their father.  The gift included a cake costing [$11], a dozen balloons costing [$0.5 for 2 balloons], and 2 tubs of ice cream costing [$7 each].  They received equal allowances. How much allowance did each girl receive from their mother?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the balloons.  Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, one dozen (12) balloons cost (12/2) * $0.5 = $3.

Next, let's find the total cost of the gifts. The cake cost $11, the balloons cost $3, and the two tubs of ice cream cost 2 * $7 = $14.  Therefore, the total cost of the gifts was $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to pay for the gifts, their combined allowance was $28.  Because they each received the same amount, their mother gave each girl $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

Sara wants to buy a jacket costing [$30] and two pairs of shoes costing [$20] each.  Her parents pay her [$4] per lawn mowing. She earns [$5] per babysitting job and babysat four times. She started with [$10] savings. How many times must she mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:

* Jacket cost: [$30]
* Shoes cost: 2 pairs * [$20/pair] = [$40]
* Total cost: [$30] + [$40] = [$70]

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earned from babysitting:

* Babysitting earnings: 4 babysitting jobs * [$5/job] = [$20]

Now, let's find out how much money Sara had before mowing any lawns:

* Initial savings: [$10]
* Total before mowing: [$10] + [$20] = [$30]

Finally, let's determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to reach her goal:

* Money needed from mowing: [$70] (total cost) - [$30] (total before mowing) = [$40]
* Lawns to mow: [$40] (money needed) / [$4/lawn] (money per lawn) = 10 lawns

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

* **Year 2:** The town will build three times the number of homes built in Year 1, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.
* **Year 3:** To find the number of homes built in Year 3, we first need to find the total number of homes built in the first two years. This is 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  Then, in the third year, they will double this amount, building 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Finally, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

Therefore, the town will have built a total of 144 homes over the next three years.

Aleksandra's Dinner Costs:  [Bagel Cost] [Cake Cost] [Soup Cost] [Total Cost Calculation]

Aleksandra ordered soup, a bagel, and cake. The bagel cost $4. The cake cost half the price of the bagel. The soup cost 25% more than the bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for her dinner?


**Answer:**

The bagel cost $4.  [Bagel Cost]

The cake cost half the price of the bagel, so the cake cost $4 / 2 = $2. [Cake Cost]

The soup cost 25% more than the bagel.  A 25% increase on $4 is $4 * 0.25 = $1.  Therefore, the soup cost $4 + $1 = $5. [Soup Cost]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the bagel, cake, and soup: $4 + $2 + $5 = $11. [Total Cost Calculation]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

221,Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Bethany's lap rate: [Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.]
Trey's lap rate relative to Bethany's: [Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.]
Shaelyn's lap rate relative to Trey's: [Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.]
Quinn's lap rate relative to Shaelyn's: [Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.]

How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine how many laps Trey can run.  The problem states that [Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany], and Bethany runs 10 laps. Therefore, Trey runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Next, we find out how many laps Shaelyn runs.  The problem says [Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey], so Shaelyn runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Finally, we determine how many laps Quinn runs.  The problem states that [Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn], meaning Quinn runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

The question asks how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.  Bethany runs 10 laps, and Quinn runs 5 laps.  Therefore, Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

The answer is {5}.

He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Frederick is making popsicle sticks.  A [2x4 lumber] costs [$4] and yields [200 sticks]. A [2x8 lumber] costs [$6] and yields [400 sticks]. He has [$24] to buy wood. What is the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?


**Answer:**

The question asks for the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make using the cheapest lumber, given a budget of $24.  The cheapest lumber is the [2x4 lumber] at [$4] per piece, yielding [200 sticks].

With $24, he can buy $24 / $4 per 2x4 = 6 pieces of 2x4 lumber.

Since each 2x4 yields 200 sticks, 6 pieces of 2x4 lumber will yield 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 popsicle sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200.

**Answer: {1200}**

223,"Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along.  By this point, Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?","**Reformatted Question:**

Ellen has a case of 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken.  [Action 1: Brother takes 1 shaken, 2 unshaken]. [Action 2: Ellen takes 1 unshaken].  What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend, who takes a soda next, gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?


**Answer:**

Let's track the sodas:

* **Starting:** 12 sodas total; 3 shaken, 9 unshaken.
* **Action 1 (Brother):** The brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.  The total number of sodas remaining is 9.
* **Action 2 (Ellen):** Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas remaining is 8.

Ellen's friend is now choosing from 8 sodas, 2 of which are shaken.  Therefore, the probability of Ellen's friend selecting a shaken soda is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

Therefore, there is a 25% likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda.

224,Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest.  [Contestants: Zoey, Sydney] [Zoey's Watermelon Seeds: 40] [Zoey's Spit Distance: 10 feet/seed] [Sydney's Watermelon Seeds: 35] [Sydney's Spit Distance: 12 feet/seed]  Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. What is the average total distance spat?


**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the total distance Zoey spat her seeds.  Zoey had [Zoey's Watermelon Seeds: 40] seeds and spat each one [Zoey's Spit Distance: 10 feet/seed], so her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spat her seeds. Sydney had [Sydney's Watermelon Seeds: 35] seeds and spat each one [Sydney's Spit Distance: 12 feet/seed], resulting in a total distance of 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances for both Zoey and Sydney and divide by the number of contestants (2).  The total distance is 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.  Therefore, the average total distance spat is 820 feet / 2 contestants = 410 feet.

The answer is {410}.

225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","**Reformatted Question:**

Donny has two mugs of water.  Mug A is 33 degrees. Mug B is an unknown temperature (x).  Donny pours 4 ounces from Mug A and 1 ounce from Mug B into his water bottle. The resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.  What is the minimum temperature (x) of Mug B?


**Answer:**

Let's denote the temperature of Mug A as T<sub>A</sub> = 33 degrees, and the temperature of Mug B as T<sub>B</sub> = x degrees.  Donny pours 4 ounces from Mug A and 1 ounce from Mug B into his water bottle.

The total amount of water in the bottle is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

To find the final temperature (T<sub>f</sub>) of the mixture in the water bottle, we can use a weighted average:

T<sub>f</sub> = [(4 ounces * T<sub>A</sub>) + (1 ounce * T<sub>B</sub>)] / 5 ounces

We know that Donny can only drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees, so T<sub>f</sub> ≥ 40.  Substituting the known values, we get:

40 ≤ [(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees)] / 5 ounces

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

200 ≤ (132 + x)

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle (Mug B) must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to reach a drinkable temperature of 40 degrees or higher.  The answer is {68}.

226,Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the third year it depreciated 20%.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%. How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"**Reformatted Question:**

Gary bought a boat for [$9000]. Over the first year it depreciated [30%]. The second year it depreciated another [30%]. Over the third year it depreciated [20%]. How much is the boat worth after the three years?


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the depreciation after the first year.  The boat depreciated by 30% of its initial value, which was $9000.  This is 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.  So, after the first year, the boat was worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

Next, we calculate the depreciation after the second year. The boat depreciated by another 30%, but this time it's 30% of the *new* value ($6300), not the original value.  This is 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.  After the second year, the boat was worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, we calculate the depreciation after the third year. The boat depreciated by 20% of its value after the second year ($4410). This is 0.20 * $4410 = $882.  Therefore, after the third year, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

At the beginning of the year, each of the <fact1>30 students</fact1> in Marissa's class had <fact2>10 pencils</fact2>. After two months, <fact3>1/5 of the total pencils</fact3> were used.  At the end of the year, only <fact4>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact4> were left. How many pencils were left at the end of the year?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the total number of pencils at the start of the year.  Since there were <fact1>30 students</fact1> and each had <fact2>10 pencils</fact2>, there were 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

Next, we calculate how many pencils were used after two months.  <fact3>1/5 of the total pencils</fact3> were used, so (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils were used.

This means that after two months, there were 300 - 60 = 240 pencils remaining.

Finally, at the end of the year, only <fact4>1/3 of the remaining pencils</fact4> were left.  Therefore, (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils were left at the end of the year.

Kim, a sleepwalker, usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.  One day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom and then sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?


**Answer:**

Kim usually wakes up at 6:00 a.m.  However, on this day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, at 5:55 a.m. (because she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom).

Her sleepwalking episode lasted from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

From her usual bedtime of 10:00 p.m. to her earlier wake-up time of 5:55 a.m., she would have slept for 7 hours and 55 minutes.  Converting this to minutes: (7 hours * 60 minutes/hour) + 55 minutes = 475 minutes.

During this time, she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes.  Therefore, the amount of time she slept on her bed that day is 475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.
