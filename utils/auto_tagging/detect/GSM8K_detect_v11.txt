A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs <fact1>$800 per month</fact1> in rent and will cost an additional <fact2>$260 per month</fact2> in utilities. The second apartment costs <fact3>$900 per month</fact3> and will cost an additional <fact4>$200 per month</fact4> in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive <fact5>31 miles per day</fact5> to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive <fact6>21 miles</fact6> to get to work.
