A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs <fact1>$800 per month in rent</fact1> and will cost an additional <fact2>$260 per month in utilities</fact2>. The second apartment costs <fact3>$900 per month</fact3> and will cost an additional <fact4>$200 per month in utilities</fact4>. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive <fact5>31 miles per day</fact5> to get to work.
