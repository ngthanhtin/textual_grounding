<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$800 per month in rent</fact1> and will cost an additional <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$260 per month in utilities</fact2>. The second apartment costs <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$900 per month</fact3> and will cost an additional <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$200 per month in utilities</fact4>. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">31 miles per day</fact5> to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">21 miles to get to work</fact6>. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">58 cents</fact7>.
