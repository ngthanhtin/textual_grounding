A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The <fact1>first apartment costs $800 per month in rent</fact1> and will cost an <fact2>additional $260 per month in utilities</fact2>. The <fact3>second apartment costs $900 per month</fact3> and will cost an <fact4>additional $200 per month in utilities</fact4>. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive <fact5>31 miles per day</fact5> to get to work.
