Among the various models of Delta vacuum cleaners, <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a particular model cleans</fact1> simply by <fact2>determining how powerful its motor is</fact2>. The efficiency of <fact3>dust filtration systems varies significantly</fact3>, even between models of <fact4>Delta vacuum cleaners equipped with identically powerful motors</fact4>. The argument's conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? Answer Choices: (a) All Delta vacuum cleaners that clean equally effectively have identically powerful motors. (b) One cannot accurately assess how effectively any Delta vacuum cleaner cleans without knowing how powerful that vacuum cleaner's motor is. (c) For each Delta vacuum cleaner, the efficiency of its dust filtration system has a significant impact on how effectively it cleans. (d) For any two Delta vacuum cleaners with equally efficient dust filtration systems, the one with the more powerful motor cleans more effectively.

Scientists examined <fact1>diamonds</fact1> that were <fact2>formed on Earth about 2.9 billion years ago</fact2>. These diamonds had a <fact3>higher-than-normal concentration of sulfur-33</fact3>. This concentration can be explained only by <fact4>certain chemical reactions that are stimulated by ultraviolet light</fact4>. If there had been <fact5>more than a trace of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact5>, then not enough <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> would have reached Earth’s surface to stimulate the chemical reactions. The information above most strongly supports which one of the following? Answer Choices: (a) Earth’s atmosphere contained very little, if any, oxygen 2.9 billion years ago. (b) Most diamonds with higher-than-normal concentrations of sulfur-33 were formed at least 2.9 billion years ago. (c) Ultraviolet light causes the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere to react chemically with sulfur-33. (d) The formation of diamonds occurs only in the presence of ultraviolet light.

In recent years, many cabinetmakers have been winning acclaim as artists. But since <fact1>furniture must be useful</fact1>, cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to the practical utility of their product. For this reason, <fact2>cabinetmaking is not art</fact2>. Which of the following is an assumption that supports drawing the conclusion above from the reason given for that conclusion? Answer Choices: (a) Some furniture is made to be placed in museums, where it will not be used by anyone. (b) Artists are not concerned with the monetary value of their products. (c) Cabinetmakers should be more concerned with the practical utility of their products than they currently are. (d) <fact3>An object is not an art object if its maker pays attention to the object's practical utility</fact3>.

Doctor: There will be <fact1>more local cases of flu infection this year</fact1> than there were <fact2>last year</fact2>. In addition to the <fact3>strains of flu that were present in this area last year</fact3>, a <fact4>new strain has infected some people this year</fact4>. The conclusion of the doctor's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? Answer Choices: (a) It is rare for new strains of flu to appear. (b) The new strain of flu cannot be addressed with the approaches used to deal with the strains of flu that were present last year. (c) <fact5>There will be no decline this year</fact5> in the number of cases of flu infection due to strains that were present last year. (d) The new strain of flu is expected to be more dangerous than the strains of flu that were present last year.

The growing popularity of <fact1>computer-based activities</fact1> was widely expected to result in a decline in <fact2>television viewing</fact2>, since it had been assumed that people lack sufficient free time to maintain current <fact2>television-viewing levels</fact2> while spending increasing amounts of free time on the <fact1>computer</fact1>. That assumption, however, is evidently false: in a recent mail survey concerning media use, a very large majority of respondents who report increasing time spent per week using <fact1>computers</fact1> report no change in time spent <fact2>watching television</fact2>. In order to evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to determine which of the following?  Answer Choices: (a) Whether a large majority of the computer owners in the survey reported spending increasing amounts of time per week using computers (b) Whether the survey collected information about the amount of money respondents spent on free-time media use (c) Whether the amount of time spent <fact2>watching television</fact2> is declining among people who report that they rarely or never use <fact1>computers</fact1> (d) Whether the survey respondents' reports of time spent using <fact1>computers</fact1> included time spent using computers at work

The <fact1>Great Sphinx</fact1> is a huge statue in <fact2>Egypt</fact2> that has a <fact3>lion's body</fact3> with a <fact4>man's head</fact4>. The face of the Sphinx has long been claimed to be that of pharaoh <fact5>Khafre</fact5>, who lived around <fact6>2600 B.C.</fact6>, but it cannot be: erosion patterns recently discovered on the lion's legs can only have been caused by <fact7>heavy rains</fact7>, and the Sahara has <fact8>not had heavy rains in over 10,000 years</fact8>. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? Answer Choices: (a) Other erosion patterns that appear on the body of the Sphinx are of a sort that could be caused by wind and sand alone (b) The face of the Sphinx bears a resemblance to the faces on certain stylized statues dating from both before and after the reign of Khafre. (c) Other than the Sphinx, there are no surviving sculptures that have been claimed to portray the face of Khafre. (d) The face of the Sphinx is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may have been recarved long after the Sphinx was built.

<fact1>Lawyer: Did Congleton assign the best available graphic artist to the project?</fact1> Witness: Yes. <fact2>Lawyer: And the best writer?</fact2> Witness: Yes. <fact3>Lawyer: In fact everyone she assigned to work on the project was top notch?</fact3> Witness: That's true. <fact4>Lawyer: So, you lied to the court when you said, earlier, that Congleton wanted the project to fail?</fact4> Each of the following accurately describes a flaw in the lawyer's reasoning displayed above EXCEPT: Answer Choices: (a) It takes for granted that Congleton was not forced to assign the people she did to the project. (b) It ignores the possibility that the witness failed to infer from known facts what should have been inferred and therefore was not lying. (c) It takes for granted that the project could fail only if Congleton wanted it to fail. (d) It ignores the possibility that Congleton knew that the people assigned to the project would not work well together.

Editor Y: This is a <fact1>good photograph</fact1>: the composition is attractive, especially in the way the image is blurred by smoke in one corner. Editor Z: It' s <fact2>very pretty</fact2>, but it' s a <fact3>bad photograph</fact3>. It doesn' t make a statement; there' s no obvious reason for the smoke to be there. The editors' dialogue provides the most support for the claim that they disagree with each other about whether Answer Choices: (a) a photograph that is not attractive can still be a good photograph (b) <fact4>attractiveness by itself can make a photograph a good photograph</fact4> (c) a photograph's composition should be related to a statement that it makes (d) a photograph that makes no statement can still be attractive
