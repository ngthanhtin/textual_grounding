Once upon a time in <fact1>ancient times</fact1> there was a king who was very fond of wines. He had a huge cellar, which had <fact2>1000 different varieties of wine</fact2> all in different caskets (<fact3>1000 caskets</fact3> in all). In the adjoining kingdom, there was a queen who was envious of the king’s huge wine collection. After some time, when she could not bear it any more, she conspired to kill him by poisoning all his wine caskets. So she sent one sentry to poison all the caskets, but no sooner had the sentry poisoned <fact4>only one wine casket</fact4>, he was caught and killed by the Royal guards. Now the king had a major problem on his hands to identify the poisonous casket, which he gave to the Minister. But the situation had two peculiarities. <fact5>I: Any one who takes even one drop from the poisonous casket will die.</fact5> <fact6>II: He will die only after one month.</fact6> The king also handed over <fact7>few prisoners</fact7> to the Minister as “tasters” of those caskets, as their lives were of little value. If the Minister is allowed only <fact8>1 month</fact8> to find out the poisonous casket, what is the minimum number of prisoners he should use as “tasters”? Answer Choices: (a) 1023 (b) 1024 (c) 1025 (d) 1026 (e) 1027

<fact1>McDonald's</fact1> ran a campaign in which it gave <fact2>game cards</fact2> to its customers. These game cards made it possible for customers to <fact3>win hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, and other fast-food items, as well as cash prizes</fact3>. Each card had <fact4>10 covered spots</fact4> that could be uncovered by rubbing them with a coin. Beneath <fact5>three of these spots</fact5> were "No Prize" signs. Beneath the other <fact6>seven spots</fact6> were names of prizes, <fact7>two of which were identical</fact7>. For example, one card might have two pictures of a hamburger, one picture of a Coke, one of French fries, one of a milkshake, one of 5 Dollar, one of 1000 Dollar, and three "No Prize" signs. For this card, the customer could win a hamburger. To win on any card, the customers had to uncover the <fact8>two matching spots</fact8> (which showed the potential prize for that card) before uncovering a "No Prize"; any card with a "No Prize" uncovered was automatically void. Assuming that the two matches and the three "No Prize" signs were arranged randomly on the cards, what is the probability of a customer winning? Answer Choices: (a) 0.1 (b) 0.15 (c) 0.12 (d) 0.18 (e) 0.13

There is a vertical stack of books marked <fact1>1, 2, and 3</fact1> on <fact2>Table-A</fact2>, with <fact3>1 at the bottom</fact3> and <fact4>3 on top</fact4>. These are to be placed vertically on <fact5>Table-B</fact5> with <fact6>1 at the bottom</fact6> and <fact7>2 on the top</fact7>, by making a series of moves from one table to the other. During a move, the <fact8>topmost book</fact8>, or the topmost two books, or <fact8>all the three</fact8>, can be moved from one of the tables to the other. If there are any books on the other table, the stack being transferred should be placed on top of the existing books, without changing the order of books in the stack that is being moved in that move. If there are no books on the other table, the stack is simply placed on the other table without disturbing the order of books in it. What is the <fact9>minimum number of moves</fact9> in which the above task can be accomplished? Answer Choices: (a) One (b) Two (c) Three (d) Four (e) None

A town consists of only <fact1>one street in the form of a circle</fact1>. The town authorities give out <fact2>four licenses for a particular kind of business</fact2>. The inhabitants of the town <fact3>live in equal density along the circle</fact3> and will always go to the closest business for what they need. Business A gets to choose a location first, then business B, then C, and finally D. Each business desires to <fact4>carve out as much business for themselves as possible</fact4>, but each knows the others all have the same motive. Assume that if a business is indifferent between locating in two different sections of the circle, it will choose a section at random. Also assume that the business that goes last will choose a location in the middle of the largest (or one of the largest) sections. Where should business B choose relative to the location of A? Answer Choices: (a) more than 1/3 (b) barely less than 1/3 (c) less than 2/3 (d) more than 2/3 (e) more than 3/3

Further, the <fact6>total of numbers</fact6> on the three cards in the first cage is greater by two than that in the second and by four than that in the third. When a customer asks for his prognosis, the fortune teller lets out the three parrots, which randomly pick one card out of their respective cages. Before the prognosis is made, the fortune teller totals the numbers on the three cards picked out by the parrots and charges the customer the same number of rupees as the <fact7>total of the numbers on the cards</fact7>.
