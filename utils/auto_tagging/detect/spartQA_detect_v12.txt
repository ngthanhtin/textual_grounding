We have three blocks, A, B, and C. <fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>. <fact2>Below block A is block B, which has one medium black square</fact2>. <fact3>To the left of block B, there is block C, which has two medium blue squares</fact3>. Medium blue square number one is below <fact4>medium blue square number two</fact4>. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? <fact1>A medium blue square that is in block A</fact1> or <fact4>a medium blue square number two</fact4>? (a) medium blue square that is in block A (b) medium blue square number two (c) both of them (d) none of them

We have two blocks. Let's call them A and B. There are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1> in block A. Small yellow triangle number one is above and near to small yellow triangle number two. To the right of block A, there is block B, which contains <fact2>one small blue triangle</fact2>. To the left of and far from <fact3>a small blue circle</fact3> is <fact4>a big blue circle</fact4>. It is above the small blue triangle. The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block. To the right of the small blue triangle is the small blue circle. Which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle? the <fact3>small blue circle</fact3> or the <fact2>small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block</fact2>? (a) the small blue circle (b) the small blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block (c) both of them (d) none of them.

There are three blocks. We call them A, B, and C. <fact1>Block A contains two big black circles</fact1>. There is also <fact2>a small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge of this block</fact2>. Big black circle number two is touching the right edge of this block. Big black circle number one is to the left of and near to big black circle number two. This shape is above the small yellow triangle. Above block A is <fact3>block B with a big black triangle in it</fact3>. <fact4>Above block B, there is block C</fact4>. It contains <fact5>two big yellow triangles</fact5>. Big yellow triangle number one is touching the right edge of this block. It is above big yellow triangle number two. What is above the big black triangle? <fact2>A small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block</fact2> or <fact5>a big yellow triangle</fact5>? (a) small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block (b) big yellow triangle (c) both of them (d) none of them

We have three blocks, A, B, and C. <fact1>Block B is below C</fact1>. <fact2>Block A is to the left of B</fact2>. Block A contains a medium yellow triangle and a small yellow circle. The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and above the small yellow circle. <fact3>Block B contains one small yellow triangle</fact3>. And block C contains one medium yellow circle, one medium black circle, and one small black circle. A medium blue circle is near to the small black circle. This object is near to and to the left of the medium yellow circle, which is to the right of, near to, and above the medium black circle. It is above the medium black circle. Which object is to the left of <fact3>a small yellow triangle</fact3>? the small yellow circle or the medium yellow circle? (a) the small yellow circle (b) the medium yellow circle (c) both of them (d) none of them

There are two blocks, A, and B. <fact1>Block A has one big yellow triangle and a big black square</fact1>. <fact2>Below the big black square there is the big yellow triangle</fact2>. It is touching the bottom edge of this block. It also contains <fact3>one small yellow square</fact3>. <fact4>The big black square is to the left of and near to the small yellow square</fact4>. <fact5>Above block A we have block B</fact5> which contains <fact6>one big black triangle and a big black circle</fact6>. <fact7>The big black triangle is near to the big black circle</fact7>. What is below the big black triangle? <fact1>A big black square</fact1> or <fact6>a circle</fact6>? (a) big black square (b) circle (c) both of them (d) none of them

There are three blocks. Let's call them A, B, and C. Block A contains a <fact1>big blue circle</fact1> and a <fact2>medium black circle</fact2>. The big blue circle is <fact3>touching the bottom edge of this block</fact3>. A <fact4>big yellow circle</fact4> is to the left of the medium black circle. The medium black circle is <fact5>touching the right edge of this block</fact5>. To the left of the medium black circle, there is the big blue circle. It is below the yellow object, which is to the left of the medium black circle. To the left of block A, we have block B with a <fact6>big blue square</fact6> in it. Below block A, there is block C, which has a <fact7>medium yellow square</fact7>. This block also has one <fact8>medium yellow circle</fact8>. Above the medium yellow square, there is the medium yellow circle. What is to the right of the big blue square? a medium yellow circle or a medium yellow square? (a) medium yellow circle (b) medium yellow square (c) both of them (d) none of them
