<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>1/ Tagged Question:</strong>Once upon a time in <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">ancient times</fact1> there was a king who was very fond of wines. He had a huge cellar, which had <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1000 different varieties of wine</fact2> all in different caskets (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1000 caskets</fact3> in all). In the adjoining kingdom, there was a queen who was envious of the king’s huge wine collection. After some time, when she could not bear it any more, she conspired to kill him by poisoning all his wine caskets. So she sent one sentry to poison all the caskets, but no sooner had the sentry poisoned <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">only one wine casket</fact4>, he was caught and killed by the Royal guards. Now the king had a major problem on his hands to identify the poisonous casket, which he gave to the Minister. But the situation had two peculiarities. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">I: Any one who takes even one drop from the poisonous casket will die.</fact5> <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">II: He will die only after one month.</fact6> The king also handed over <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">few prisoners</fact7> to the Minister as “tasters” of those caskets, as their lives were of little value. If the Minister is allowed only <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">1 month</fact8> to find out the poisonous casket, what is the minimum number of prisoners he should use as “tasters”? Answer Choices: (a) 1023 (b) 1024 (c) 1025 (d) 1026 (e) 1027<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>Study the following table carefully. Each of the prisoners drinks wine from whichever casket has a 1 in his place. If he does not drink there is a 0. So if no one dies, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Casket 1 is poisoned</fact4>. If P1 dies, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">casket 2 is poisoned</fact4>. If P1 and P3 die ⇒⇒ <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">casket 6 is poisoned</fact4> and so on. So, if there are <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">3 prisoners</fact7>, we can differentiate up to 2^3 =8 caskets. So for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1000 caskets</fact3> [even 1024 caskets], we need only 10 prisoners as 2^10 = 1024. The answer is {B}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>2/ Tagged Question:</strong><fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">McDonald's</fact1> ran a campaign in which it gave <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">game cards</fact2> to its customers. These game cards made it possible for customers to <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">win hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, and other fast-food items, as well as cash prizes</fact3>. Each card had <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 covered spots</fact4> that could be uncovered by rubbing them with a coin. Beneath <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">three of these spots</fact5> were "No Prize" signs. Beneath the other <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">seven spots</fact6> were names of prizes, <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">two of which were identical</fact7>. For example, one card might have two pictures of a hamburger, one picture of a Coke, one of French fries, one of a milkshake, one of 5 Dollar, one of 1000 Dollar, and three "No Prize" signs. For this card, the customer could win a hamburger. To win on any card, the customers had to uncover the <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">two matching spots</fact8> (which showed the potential prize for that card) before uncovering a "No Prize"; any card with a "No Prize" uncovered was automatically void. Assuming that the two matches and the three "No Prize" signs were arranged randomly on the cards, what is the probability of a customer winning? Answer Choices: (a) 0.1 (b) 0.15 (c) 0.12 (d) 0.18 (e) 0.13<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>As per the question, there are <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 cover spots</fact4> out of which (i) <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Three spots are there with no prize</fact5> (identical) (ii) <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Two spots of the same sign</fact7> (Prize) (iii) Five other spots which are distinct. Let <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">three spots of no prize</fact5> are (x,x,x), <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">two spots of the same sign</fact7> are b(P,P), and five other spots are (A,B,C,D,E). Total number of cases without restriction: =>10!/(3!x2!). Total number of favorable cases happen in the following ways which shows the sequence of uncovering are as follows: CASE I: Second uncovering is P =>P P _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _=8C3×5!×1.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>4/ Tagged Question:</strong>A town consists of only <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">one street in the form of a circle</fact1>. The town authorities give out <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">four licenses for a particular kind of business</fact2>. The inhabitants of the town <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">live in equal density along the circle</fact3> and will always go to the closest business for what they need. Business A gets to choose a location first, then business B, then C, and finally D. Each business desires to <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">carve out as much business for themselves as possible</fact4>, but each knows the others all have the same motive. Assume that if a business is indifferent between locating in two different sections of the circle, it will choose a section at random. Also assume that the business that goes last will choose a location in the middle of the largest (or one of the largest) sections. Where should business B choose relative to the location of A? Answer Choices: (a) more than 1/3 (b) barely less than 1/3 (c) less than 2/3 (d) more than 2/3 (e) more than 3/3<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>The answer is just <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">barely less than 1/3 of the circumference of the circle</fact4> away from A. This is only a quick overview of the solution, the details are left up to you. Let the circumference of the circle be 1 and that A chooses a location at point 0. Business D will choose a location in the middle of the largest section. Business C will also choose the midpoint of the larger of the two gaps between the first two businesses. If business B chooses a point <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">before 1/3</fact4>, then C will choose a point halfway between B and 1. Business D will choose randomly between the halfway point between A and C or B and C. If x is the location of business B, then the area which B will carve out of the circle will be either (1+3x)/8 if D goes between B and C or (1+x)/4 if D goes between A and C. The average of these is (3+5x)/16. The same logic applies if B chooses a point <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">after 2/3</fact4>. If business B chooses a point <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">after 1/3 (but before 1/2)</fact4>, then C will choose a point halfway between A and B going the long way, and D will choose the halfway point between A and B the short way. This will leave B exactly a 1/4 share of the business. The same logic applies if A chooses a point between 1/2 and just before 2/3. If B should choose a location at exactly 1/3, then C would choose at 2/3, and D would be indifferent between 1/6, 1/2, and 5/6. B would have a 2/3 chance of having 1/4 of the business share and 1/3 chance of having 1/3, the average being 5/18 =~ 0.27778. Thus B should try to maximize (3+5x)/16 without choosing x equal or greater to 1/3. The <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">optimal choice of location</fact4> would be just a hair short of 1/3 (or just a hair after 2/3). At this point, B will have a 50/50 chance at having either 1/4 or 1/3 of the market share for an average of 7/24=~ 0.29166667 of the market share. The answer is {B}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>5/ Tagged Question:</strong>A fortune teller has a unique way of predicting his customer’s prognosis. He has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">three parrots</fact1> kept in <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three different cages</fact2>. Each cage has <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">three cards</fact3> with a <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">one digit non-zero number</fact4> inscribed on every card. No <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">two cards have the same number</fact5> and no cage contains two cards with the number totaling ten. Further, the <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">total of numbers</fact6> on the three cards in the first cage is greater by two than that in the second and by four than that in the third. When a customer asks for his prognosis, the fortune teller lets out the three parrots, which randomly pick one card out of their respective cages. Before the prognosis is made, the fortune teller totals the numbers on the three cards picked out by the parrots and charges the customer the same number of rupees as the <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">total of the numbers on the cards</fact7>. One day a customer paid <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">seven rupees</fact8> for his prognosis. Which of the following combinations of cards may be picked for prognosis? Answer Choices: (a) 5, 7, 8 (b) 7, 9, 4 (c) 2, 6, 3 (d) 1, 3, 8 (e) None of these<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>Considering the cages named as A, B, and C, according to the given condition, the <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">total of numbers</fact6> in the first cage (A) is greater by two than that in the second (B), and by four than that in the third (C). So, A = 2B and A = 4C. The customer paid the amount as the <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">sum</fact8> of the three numbers on the cards, i.e., card A, card B, and card C = <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">seven rupees</fact8>. Thus, A + B + C = 7, and by substituting A = 2B and A = 4C into the equation, we get A + (A/2) + (A/4) = 7. Solving this equation, we find A = 4. Therefore, the values for A, B, and C are 4, 2, and 1, respectively. The answer is {E}.</div></div>
