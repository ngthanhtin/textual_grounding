### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block B (below A)</fact2> has <fact3>a black square</fact3>. <fact4>Block C, to the left of Block B</fact4>, has <fact5>two medium blue squares</fact5>, with <fact8>blue square number two</fact8> on top and <fact6>number one below it</fact6>. Since <fact4>the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B</fact4>. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
In <fact2>block A</fact2>, there are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1>. <fact3>To the right of block A, block B</fact3> contains <fact4>a small blue triangle</fact4> touching the bottom edge and a small blue circle to its right. Since both the small blue circle and <fact4>the small blue triangle</fact4> are <fact5>to the right of the small yellow triangles</fact5>. The answer is {C}.

### TAGGED ANSWER: 
<fact1>Block A</fact1> contains a <fact3>small yellow triangle</fact3> touching the <fact4>bottom edge</fact4>, and <fact11>Block C</fact11> (<fact10>above Block B</fact10>) contains <fact12>two big yellow triangles</fact12>, with <fact13>big yellow triangle number one</fact13> above <fact14>big yellow triangle number two</fact14>. Since <fact11>Block C</fact11> is directly <fact10>above Block B</fact10> (which contains the <fact9>big black triangle</fact9>), the object <fact10>above the big black triangle</fact10> is a <fact15>big yellow triangle</fact15>. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER: 
<fact3>Block A contains a small yellow circle</fact3>, and <fact5>Block B contains a small yellow triangle</fact5>. Since <fact2>Block A is to the left of Block B</fact2>, and <fact3>the small yellow circle is in Block A</fact3>, it is to the left of the <fact5>small yellow triangle</fact5>. The medium yellow circle, which is in Block C, is above and to the right of the <fact5>small yellow triangle</fact5>, but not to the left of it. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER: 
<fact5>Block A</fact5>, which is below Block B, contains a <fact1>big black square</fact1>. Since the <fact5>big black triangle is in Block B</fact5> and <fact5>Block A is directly below Block B</fact5>, the object directly <fact6>below the big black triangle</fact6> is the <fact1>big black square</fact1> in <fact5>Block A</fact5>. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER: 
<fact8>Block B</fact8> contains <fact13>the big blue square</fact13>, and Block C, which is below <fact1>Block A</fact1>, contains both <fact9>the medium yellow square</fact9> and <fact10>the medium yellow circle</fact10>. Since <fact10>the medium yellow circle</fact10> is <fact11>above the medium yellow square</fact11> and both are located in Block C, which is <fact9>below Block A</fact9>, <fact12>neither</fact12> of these objects is directly to the right of <fact13>the big blue square</fact13> in <fact8>Block B</fact8>. The answer is {D}.
