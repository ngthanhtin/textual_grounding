<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>1/ Tagged Question:</strong>The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a bus, a motorcycle, a hatchback, a station wagon, a minivan, a truck, and a limousine. The station wagon is the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">fourth-newest</fact1>. The motorcycle is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">newer than the truck</fact2>. The station wagon is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">older than the hatchback</fact3>. The minivan is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">newer than the hatchback</fact4>. The bus is <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">newer than the minivan</fact5>. The truck is <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">newer than the limousine</fact6>. Options: (A) The bus is the third-oldest (B) The motorcycle is the third-oldest (C) The hatchback is the third-oldest (D) The station wagon is the third-oldest (E) The minivan is the third-oldest (F) The truck is the third-oldest (G) The limousine is the third-oldest<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts: 1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest**: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon. 2. **The motorcycle is newer than the truck**: This indicates that the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age. 3. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback**: This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon. 4. **The minivan is newer than the hatchback**: This places the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age. 5. **The bus is newer than the minivan**: This means the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback. 6. **The truck is newer than the limousine**: This indicates that the limousine is older than the truck. Now, let's summarize the order based on the information: - Since the station wagon is the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">fourth-newest</fact1>, we can denote the order as follows: - 1st: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Bus (newest)</fact5> - 2nd: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Minivan (newer than hatchback)</fact4> - 3rd: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Motorcycle (newer than truck)</fact2> - 4th: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Station Wagon (given)</fact1> - 5th: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Hatchback (older than station wagon)</fact3> - 6th: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Truck (newer than limousine)</fact2> - 7th: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Limousine (oldest)</fact6> From this arrangement, we can see that the third-oldest vehicle is the **<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">motorcycle</fact2>**. The answer is {B}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>2/ Tagged Question:</strong>The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a hummingbird, a cardinal, a blue jay, an owl, a raven, a quail, and a robin. The <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">hummingbird is to the left of the quail</fact1>. The <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">robin is to the left of the cardinal</fact2>. The <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">blue jay is the leftmost</fact3>. The <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">cardinal is the fourth from the left</fact4>.

Now, we can summarize the positions: 1. Blue Jay 2. Hummingbird 3. Owl 4. Cardinal 5. Raven 6. Quail 7. Robin Now, we can answer the question regarding which bird is the second from the right. The second from the right is position 2, which is occupied by the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">hummingbird</fact1>. The answer is {A}.</div></div>
