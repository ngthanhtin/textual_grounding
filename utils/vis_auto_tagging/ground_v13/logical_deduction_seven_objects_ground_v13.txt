### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Dan finished third</fact1>: So, Dan is placed in the 3rd position. <fact2>Ana finished above Ada</fact2>: This means Ana is ranked higher (closer to 1st place) than Ada. <fact3>Amy finished last</fact3>: Amy is placed in the 7th position. <fact4>Dan finished below Rob</fact4>: Since Dan is in 3rd place, Rob must be in either 1st or 2nd place. <fact5>Eve finished below Ada</fact5>: This means Eve is ranked lower (further from 1st place) than Ada. <fact6>Rob finished below Joe</fact6>: Since Rob is ranked above Dan and Dan is 3rd, Joe must be in 1st or 2nd place, with Rob in the other position. Now, let's piece it together: Dan is 3rd. Amy is 7th. Joe is either 1st or 2nd. Rob is either 1st or 2nd (but below Joe). Ana is above Ada, and Ada is above Eve. Thus, the final ranking order should look like this: Joe (Joe must be 1st because Rob is below him) Rob (Since Rob is below Joe and above Dan) <fact1>Dan</fact1> (Given) Ana (Ana is above Ada and Eve) Ada (Ada is above Eve) Eve (Eve is below Ada) <fact3>Amy</fact3> (Given as last). The answer is {D}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts: 1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest**: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon. 2. **The motorcycle is newer than the truck**: This indicates that <fact2>the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age</fact2>. 3. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback**: This means <fact3>the hatchback is newer than the station wagon</fact3>. 4. **The minivan is newer than the hatchback**: This places <fact4>the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age</fact4>. 5. **The bus is newer than the minivan**: This means <fact5>the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback</fact5>. 6. **The truck is newer than the limousine**: This indicates that <fact6>the limousine is older than the truck</fact6>. Now, let's summarize the order based on the information: - Since <fact1>the station wagon is the fourth-newest</fact1>, we can denote the order as follows: - 1st: Bus (newest) - 2nd: Minivan (newer than hatchback) - 3rd: Motorcycle (newer than truck) - 4th: Station Wagon (given) - 5th: Hatchback (older than station wagon) - 6th: Truck (newer than limousine) - 7th: Limousine (oldest) From this arrangement, we can see that <fact2>the third-oldest vehicle is the motorcycle</fact2>. The answer is {B}.


### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step: 1. **<fact3>The blue jay is the leftmost</fact3>**: This means the blue jay is in position 1. 2. **<fact4>The cardinal is the fourth from the left</fact4>**: Therefore, the cardinal is in position 4. 3. **<fact5>The raven is the third from the right</fact5>**: Since there are seven birds, the raven is in position 5 (7 - 3 + 1 = 5). 4. **<fact6>The owl is the third from the left</fact6>**: This places the owl in position 3. 5. **<fact1>The hummingbird is to the left of the quail</fact1>**: Since the hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, and the only remaining positions are 2 and 6, the hummingbird must be in position 2 and the quail in position 6. 6. **<fact2>The robin is to the left of the cardinal</fact2>**: The only remaining position for the robin is 7, which is to the left of the cardinal in position 4. Now, we can summarize the positions: 1. Blue Jay 2. Hummingbird 3. Owl 4. Cardinal 5. Raven 6. Quail 7. Robin Now, we can answer the question regarding which bird is the second from the right. The second from the right is position 6, which is occupied by the quail. The answer is {F}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step: 
1. **<fact4>The cardinal is the second from the right</fact4>**: This means the cardinal is in position 6 (since there are 7 positions total). 
2. **<fact5>The quail is the third from the right</fact5>**: Since the cardinal is in position 6, the quail must be in position 5. 
3. **<fact3>The crow is to the right of the cardinal</fact3>**: Since the cardinal is in position 6, the crow must be in position 7. 
4. **<fact7>The owl is the second from the left</fact7>**: This means the owl is in position 2. 
5. **<fact1>The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon</fact1>**: The falcon must be in a position to the right of the hummingbird. 
6. **<fact6>The falcon is to the left of the robin</fact6>**: This means the falcon must be in a position to the left of the robin. 

Now, we can summarize the positions we have so far: 
- Position 2: <fact7>Owl</fact7> 
- Position 5: <fact5>Quail</fact5> 
- Position 6: <fact4>Cardinal</fact4> 
- Position 7: <fact3>Crow</fact3> 

Since the owl is in position 2, the only available positions left for the hummingbird, falcon, and robin are 1, 3, and 4. Given that the falcon is to the left of the robin, the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is: 
- Position 1: <fact1>Hummingbird</fact1> 
- Position 3: <fact2>Falcon</fact2> 
- Position 4: Robin 

Thus, the final arrangement from left to right is: 
1. <fact1>Hummingbird</fact1> 
2. <fact7>Owl</fact7> 
3. <fact6>Falcon</fact6> 
4. Robin 
5. <fact5>Quail</fact5> 
6. <fact4>Cardinal</fact4> 
7. <fact3>Crow</fact3> 

Now, we can answer the question: 
- The robin is in position 4. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact6>The peaches are the second-cheapest</fact6>. Explanation: 1. From <fact1>the pears are the third-cheapest</fact1>, we know that the pears are the third-cheapest. 2. From <fact3>the pears are more expensive than the plums</fact3>, since the pears are more expensive than the plums, the plums must be cheaper than the pears, placing them below the third position. 3. <fact2>The kiwis are the second-most expensive</fact2> states that the kiwis are the second-most expensive, which means they are not among the cheapest. 4. <fact4>The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis</fact4> indicates that the oranges are less expensive than the kiwis, placing them in a cheaper position than the kiwis. 5. <fact5>The mangoes are the third-most expensive</fact5> tells us that the mangoes are the third-most expensive, which means they are also not among the cheapest. 6. Finally, <fact6>the peaches are the second-cheapest</fact6>, which fits with the other facts provided. The answer is {F}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the provided facts: 1. <fact4>Ada finished second-to-last</fact4>: This means Ada is in 6th place. 2. <fact5>Mel finished third</fact5>: Mel is in 3rd place. 3. <fact6>Rob finished fourth</fact6>: Rob is in 4th place. 4. <fact1>Ada finished above Mya</fact1>: Since Ada is in 6th place, Mya must be in 7th place (last). 5. <fact2>Eli finished below Joe</fact2>: This means Joe is ranked higher than Eli. 6. <fact3>Eli finished above Eve</fact3>: This means Eve is ranked lower than Eli. Now, we can summarize the rankings based on the above facts: - 1st: Joe (since <fact2>he is above Eli</fact2>) - 2nd: Eli (since <fact3>he is above Eve</fact3>) - <fact5>3rd: Mel</fact5> - <fact6>4th: Rob</fact6> - 5th: Eve (since <fact3>she is below Eli</fact3>) - <fact4>6th: Ada</fact4> - 7th: Mya (last) Now, we need to find who finished third-to-last. The third-to-last position is 5th place. From our rankings, <fact3>Eve finished in 5th place</fact3>. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine who finished last, we analyze the provided facts: 1. **<fact1>Joe finished third</fact1>**: This places Joe in the 3rd position. 2. **<fact2>Dan finished last</fact2>**: This indicates that Dan is in the 7th position. 3. **<fact3>Eve finished first</fact3>**: Eve is in the 1st position. 4. **<fact4>Mel finished below Rob</fact4>**: This means Mel is ranked lower than Rob. 5. **<fact5>Ada finished above Joe</fact5>**: Since Joe is 3rd, Ada must be in either 1st or 2nd position. 6. **<fact6>Rob finished third-to-last</fact6>**: This means Rob is in the 5th position, as he is above Dan (7th) and below two others. Now, let's summarize the positions based on the facts: - 1st: <fact3>Eve</fact3> - 2nd: <fact5>Ada</fact5> (since she must be above Joe) - 3rd: <fact1>Joe</fact1> - 4th: <fact4>Mel</fact4> (since she is below Rob) - 5th: <fact6>Rob</fact6> - 6th: (unknown, but must be above Dan) - 7th: <fact2>Dan</fact2> The answer is {E}.
