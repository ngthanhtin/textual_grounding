### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts: 1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest**: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon. 2. **The motorcycle is newer than the truck**: This indicates that the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age. 3. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback**: This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon. 4. **The minivan is newer than the hatchback**: This places the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age. 5. **The bus is newer than the minivan**: This means the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback. 6. **The truck is newer than the limousine**: This indicates that the limousine is older than the truck. Now, let's summarize the order based on the information: - Since the station wagon is the <fact1>fourth-newest</fact1>, we can denote the order as follows: - 1st: <fact5>Bus (newest)</fact5> - 2nd: <fact4>Minivan (newer than hatchback)</fact4> - 3rd: <fact2>Motorcycle (newer than truck)</fact2> - 4th: <fact1>Station Wagon (given)</fact1> - 5th: <fact3>Hatchback (older than station wagon)</fact3> - 6th: <fact2>Truck (newer than limousine)</fact2> - 7th: <fact6>Limousine (oldest)</fact6> From this arrangement, we can see that the third-oldest vehicle is the **<fact2>motorcycle</fact2>**. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step: 1. **The blue jay is the leftmost**: This means the <fact3>blue jay</fact3> is in position 1. 2. **The cardinal is the fourth from the left**: Therefore, the <fact4>cardinal</fact4> is in position 4. 3. **The raven is the third from the right**: Since there are seven birds, the <fact5>raven</fact5> is in position 5 (7 - 3 + 1 = 5). 4. **The owl is the third from the left**: This places the <fact6>owl</fact6> in position 3. 5. **The hummingbird is to the left of the quail**: Since the <fact1>hummingbird</fact1> must be to the left of the quail, and the only remaining positions are 2 and 6, the <fact1>hummingbird</fact1> must be in position 2 and the quail in position 6. 6. **The robin is to the left of the cardinal**: The only remaining position for the <fact2>robin</fact2> is 7, which is to the left of the <fact4>cardinal</fact4> in position 4. Now, we can summarize the positions: 1. Blue Jay 2. Hummingbird 3. Owl 4. Cardinal 5. Raven 6. Quail 7. Robin Now, we can answer the question regarding which bird is the second from the right. The second from the right is position 2, which is occupied by the <fact1>hummingbird</fact1>. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step:  
1. **The cardinal is the second from the right**: This means the <fact4>cardinal</fact4> is in position 6 (since there are 7 positions total).  
2. **The quail is the third from the right**: Since the <fact5>cardinal</fact5> is in position 6, the <fact5>quail</fact5> must be in position 5.  
3. **The crow is to the right of the cardinal**: Since the <fact4>cardinal</fact4> is in position 6, the <fact3>crow</fact3> must be in position 7.  
4. **The owl is the second from the left**: This means the <fact7>owl</fact7> is in position 2.  
5. **The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon**: The <fact1>hummingbird</fact1> must be to the left of the <fact2>falcon</fact2>.  
6. **The falcon is to the left of the robin**: This means the <fact6>falcon</fact6> must be in a position to the left of the robin.

Now, we can summarize the positions we have so far:  
- Position 2: <fact7>Owl</fact7>  
- Position 5: <fact5>Quail</fact5>  
- Position 6: <fact4>Cardinal</fact4>  
- Position 7: <fact3>Crow</fact3>

Since the <fact7>owl</fact7> is in position 2, the only available positions left for the <fact1>hummingbird</fact1>, <fact2>falcon</fact2>, and robin are 1, 3, and 4. Given that the <fact2>falcon</fact2> is to the left of the robin, the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:  
- Position 1: <fact1>Hummingbird</fact1>  
- Position 3: <fact2>Falcon</fact2>  
- Position 4: Robin

Thus, the final arrangement from left to right is:  
1. <fact1>Hummingbird</fact1>  
2. <fact7>Owl</fact7>  
3. <fact2>Falcon</fact2>  
4. Robin  
5. <fact5>Quail</fact5>  
6. <fact4>Cardinal</fact4>  
7. <fact3>Crow</fact3>

Now, we can answer the question:  
- The robin is in position 4. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
The question asks which fruit is the second-cheapest. According to the information provided, <fact6>the peaches are the second-cheapest</fact6>. The answer is {F}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the provided facts:
1. **<fact4>Ada finished second-to-last</fact4>**: This means Ada is in 6th place.
2. **<fact5>Mel finished third</fact5>**: Mel is in 3rd place.
3. **<fact6>Rob finished fourth</fact6>**: Rob is in 4th place.
4. **<fact1>Ada finished above Mya</fact1>**: Since Ada is in 6th place, Mya must be in 7th place (last).
5. **<fact2>Eli finished below Joe</fact2>**: This means Joe is ranked higher than Eli.
6. **<fact3>Eli finished above Eve</fact3>**: This means Eve is ranked lower than Eli.

Now, we can summarize the rankings based on the above facts:
- 1st: Joe (since he is above Eli)
- 2nd: Eli (since he is above Eve)
- 3rd: <fact5>Mel</fact5> (given)
- 4th: <fact6>Rob</fact6> (given)
- 5th: Eve (since she is below Eli)
- <fact4>6th: Ada</fact4> (given as second-to-last)
- <fact1>7th: Mya</fact1> (last)

Now, we need to find who finished third-to-last. The third-to-last position is 5th place. From our rankings, **Eve finished in 5th place**. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
