    <div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>0/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? A machine is set up in such a way that it will <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time</fact1>. The machine will <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery</fact2>. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time</fact3>. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>Condition for a short circuit: The machine is designed to <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">If only one wire touches the battery, there will be no short circuit</fact2>. Designated roles: The black wire is the one that is supposed to touch the battery. The red wire is supposed to stay away from the battery. What happened: Both the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">black wire and the red wire ended up touching the battery</fact3>, which caused the short circuit. Causation: Even though the black wire touched the battery (as expected), the short circuit was caused because <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">both wires touched the battery</fact3>. Thus, the black wire alone didn’t cause the short circuit—it was the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">combination of both wires touching the battery</fact3>. Conclusion: A typical person would say the black wire did not cause the short circuit alone; <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">both wires contributed to the short circuit</fact3>. The answer is {no}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>1/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? Frank T., had an <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land</fact1> and one day <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">decided to shoot his neighbor in the body</fact2>. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">hand slipped on the barrel of the gun</fact3>, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">bounced off a large boulder several feet away</fact4> and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body</fact5>? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>Let's think step by step. Here in this question, we are told that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">"Frank T. had no experience with guns, his <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">hand slipped on the barrel of the gun</fact3>, and the shot went wild."</fact2> A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">hit the neighbor's body</fact4>; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">intentionally hit his neighbor</fact5>. The answer is {no}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>2/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">very important for our nation's security</fact1>. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">at exactly 9 am</fact2>. It is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">absolutely essential</fact3> that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">motion detector installed in the room</fact4> where they arrived. The motion detector was <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time</fact5>. So the motion detector went off. Did <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Billy cause the motion detector to go off</fact6>? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>Let's think step by step. Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">at the same time</fact2> and that the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time</fact4>." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">both persons</fact5>" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Billy triggered the motion detector to go off</fact6>; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. The answer is {yes}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>3/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">George just got into medical school</fact1>, Lena is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">unhappy in her marriage</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">recently lost her job</fact3>. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon, they play a game of darts. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">They split the first two games</fact4>, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">George's last shot</fact5>. If <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">he hits a high point region</fact6>, he wins; if <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">he hits a low point region</fact7>, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">he really wants to let her win</fact8>. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot, and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">Lena wins the game</fact9> and is very happy. Did George <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">hit the low point region intentionally</fact10>? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>Let's think step by step. Here in this question, we are told that <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">"He aims the dart at the low point region."</fact10> A typical person might therefore think <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">George did intentionally hit the low point region</fact10>, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Lena</fact2>. The answer is {yes}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>4/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? The <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">CEO of a company</fact1> is sitting in his office when his <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Vice President of R&D</fact2> comes in and says, 'We are thinking of starting a new programme. It will help us <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">increase profits</fact3>, but it will also <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">harm the environment</fact4>.' The CEO responds that he doesn't care about harming the environment and just wants to make <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">as much profit as possible</fact5>. The programme is carried out, profits are made and the environment is harmed. Did the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">CEO</fact1> intentionally harm the environment? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong>The <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">CEO’s</fact1> response to the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Vice President</fact2> shows he is aware that the program will <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">harm the environment</fact4>, but he explicitly states that he doesn’t care about the environmental harm and is focused solely on maximizing <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">profit</fact5>. A typical person might think that the CEO knowingly proceeded with the decision, disregarding the environmental impact, which suggests that he intentionally harmed the environment as a consequence of prioritizing <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">profit</fact3>. The answer is {yes}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>5/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jake desperately wants to have more money</fact1>. He knows that he will <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies</fact2>. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Jake isn't very good at using his rifle</fact3>. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">hits her directly in the heart</fact4>. She dies instantly. Did <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally</fact5>? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong><fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Jake raises his rifle, aims at his aunt, and pulls the trigger</fact5>. However, the narrative states <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">his hand slipped</fact3>, and the shot went off accidentally, meaning he did not have full control over the shot. A typical person might think that, although he intended to harm her, the exact outcome (<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">hitting her heart</fact4>) wasn’t intentional due to the slip. The answer is {no}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>6/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? Alex will only win the game if <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the total of his dice roll is greater than 11</fact1> AND <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the coin comes up heads</fact2>. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">rolls his dice at exactly the same time</fact3>. The coin comes up heads, and he <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">rolls a 12</fact4>, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong><fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Alex’s win depends on both a successful dice roll</fact5> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the coin flip landing on heads</fact2>. However, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the dice roll</fact4>, rather than <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the coin flip alone</fact2>, was the critical factor in reaching the threshold to win. Since <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the coin flip itself did not directly cause the win</fact2>, a typical person would likely think the coin flip was not the deciding factor. The answer is {no}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>7/ Tagged Question:</strong>How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? Jake desperately wants <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">to win the rifle contest</fact1>. He knows that he will only win the contest if he <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">hits the bull's-eye</fact2>. He raises the rifle, gets the bull's-eye in the sights, and presses the trigger. Jake is an <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">expert marksman</fact3>. His hands are steady. The gun is aimed perfectly. The bullet lands directly on the bull's-eye. Jake wins the contest. Did Jake <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">intentionally hit the bull's-eye</fact4>? Options: - Yes - No<br><br><strong>Tagged Answer:</strong><fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jake carefully aimed at the bull’s-eye</fact1> with steady hands, and as an <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">expert marksman</fact3>, he hit his target as intended. His actions align with his <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">desire and intention to win the contest</fact1> by <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">hitting the bull’s-eye</fact4>, so a typical person would think he hit it intentionally. The answer is {yes}.</div></div>
