### TAGGED ANSWER:
Let the salaries be <fact1>x, 3x, and 7x</fact1> respectively. Then, <fact2>3x + 7x = 7000</fact2> => x = 700. <fact4>Sarah's salary</fact4> = Rs. 700, <fact2>Jane's salary</fact2> = Rs. 2100, and <fact3>Gina's salary</fact3> = Rs. 4900. Excess of <fact3>Gina's salary</fact3> over <fact4>Sarah's</fact4> = [ (4200 /700) x 100] = 600%. The answer is: {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
Study the following table carefully. Each of the prisoners drinks wine from whichever casket has a 1 in his place. If he does not drink there is a 0. So if no one dies, <fact4>Casket 1 is poisoned</fact4>. If P1 dies, <fact4>casket 2 is poisoned</fact4>. If P1 and P3 die ⇒⇒ <fact4>casket 6 is poisoned</fact4> and so on. So, if there are <fact7>3 prisoners</fact7>, we can differentiate up to 2^3 =8 caskets. So for <fact3>1000 caskets</fact3> [even 1024 caskets], we need only 10 prisoners as 2^10 = 1024. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
As per the question, there are <fact4>10 cover spots</fact4> out of which (i) <fact5>Three spots are there with no prize</fact5> (identical) (ii) <fact7>Two spots of the same sign</fact7> (Prize) (iii) Five other spots which are distinct. Let <fact5>three spots of no prize</fact5> are (x,x,x), <fact7>two spots of the same sign</fact7> are b(P,P), and five other spots are (A,B,C,D,E). Total number of cases without restriction: =>10!/(3!x2!). Total number of favorable cases happen in the following ways which shows the sequence of uncovering are as follows: CASE I: Second uncovering is P =>P P _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _=8C3×5!×1. CASE II: =>_ _ P _ _ _ _ _ _ =7C3×5!×2. CASE III: =>6C3×5!×3. CASE IV: =>5C3×5!×4. CASE V: =>4C3×5!×5. CASE VI: =>3C3×5!×6. Hence, the total number of favorable cases are: =>(CASE I+II+III+IV+V+VI)/(10!/(3!x2!)). =>0.10. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
1:<fact2>Table-A</fact2> - <fact7>2-3 moved to</fact5> <fact5>Table-B</fact5>  2:<fact4>3 moved to</fact2> <fact2>Table-A</fact2>,   3:<fact7>2</fact7> moved to <fact2>Table-A</fact2>,  4: <fact1>whole series</fact1> shifted to <fact5>Table-B</fact5>.  Hence, minimum number of moves is <fact9>4</fact9>. The answer is {D}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
The answer is just <fact4>barely less than 1/3 of the circumference of the circle</fact4> away from A. This is only a quick overview of the solution, the details are left up to you. Let the circumference of the circle be 1 and that A chooses a location at point 0. Business D will choose a location in the middle of the largest section. Business C will also choose the midpoint of the larger of the two gaps between the first two businesses. If business B chooses a point <fact4>before 1/3</fact4>, then C will choose a point halfway between B and 1. Business D will choose randomly between the halfway point between A and C or B and C. If x is the location of business B, then the area which B will carve out of the circle will be either (1+3x)/8 if D goes between B and C or (1+x)/4 if D goes between A and C. The average of these is (3+5x)/16. The same logic applies if B chooses a point <fact4>after 2/3</fact4>. If business B chooses a point <fact4>after 1/3 (but before 1/2)</fact4>, then C will choose a point halfway between A and B going the long way, and D will choose the halfway point between A and B the short way. This will leave B exactly a 1/4 share of the business. The same logic applies if A chooses a point between 1/2 and just before 2/3. If B should choose a location at exactly 1/3, then C would choose at 2/3, and D would be indifferent between 1/6, 1/2, and 5/6. B would have a 2/3 chance of having 1/4 of the business share and 1/3 chance of having 1/3, the average being 5/18 =~ 0.27778. Thus B should try to maximize (3+5x)/16 without choosing x equal or greater to 1/3. The <fact4>optimal choice of location</fact4> would be just a hair short of 1/3 (or just a hair after 2/3). At this point, B will have a 50/50 chance at having either 1/4 or 1/3 of the market share for an average of 7/24=~ 0.29166667 of the market share. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
Considering the cages named as A, B, and C, according to the given condition, the <fact6>total of numbers</fact6> in the first cage (A) is greater by two than that in the second (B), and by four than that in the third (C). So, A = 2B and A = 4C. The customer paid the amount as the <fact8>sum</fact8> of the three numbers on the cards, i.e., card A, card B, and card C = <fact8>seven rupees</fact8>. Thus, A + B + C = 7, and by substituting A = 2B and A = 4C into the equation, we get A + (A/2) + (A/4) = 7. Solving this equation, we find A = 4. Therefore, the values for A, B, and C are 4, 2, and 1, respectively. The answer is {E}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
The probability that <fact1>Sumit</fact1> actually sees a <fact3>Shark</fact3>, given that he claimed to have seen one. =>P(He actually sees the <fact3>shark</fact3> and reports truth) / P(He claims of seeing a <fact3>shark</fact3>). =>P(Sees the <fact3>shark</fact3>)P(Reports Truth)/(P(He sees a <fact3>shark</fact3>)P(reports truth)+P(Doesn't see) P(reports false). =>(<fact4>1/8</fact4>×<fact6>1/6</fact6>)/(<fact4>1/8</fact4>×<fact6>1/6</fact6>+7/8×5/6) =>1/36. The answer is {A}.
