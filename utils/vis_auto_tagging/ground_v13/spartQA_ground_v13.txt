### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block B (below A) has a black square</fact2>. <fact3>Block C, to the left of Block B, has two medium blue squares</fact3>, with <fact4>blue square number two</fact4> on top and number one below it. Since <fact3>the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B</fact3>. The answer is {B}.
### TAGGED ANSWER:
In block A, there are <fact1>two small yellow triangles</fact1>. To the right of block A, block B contains <fact2>a small blue triangle touching the bottom edge</fact2> and <fact3>a small blue circle</fact3> to its right. Since both <fact3>the small blue circle</fact3> and <fact2>the small blue triangle</fact2> are to the right of the <fact1>small yellow triangles</fact1>, the answer is {C}.
### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Block A contains a small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge</fact1>, and <fact4>Block C (above Block B)</fact4> contains <fact5>two big yellow triangles</fact5>, with <fact5>big yellow triangle number one above big yellow triangle number two</fact5>. Since <fact4>Block C is directly above Block B (which contains the <fact3>big black triangle</fact3>)</fact4>, the object above the <fact3>big black triangle</fact3> is <fact5>a big yellow triangle</fact5>. The answer is {B}.
### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact2>Block A contains a small yellow circle</fact2>, and <fact3>Block B contains a small yellow triangle</fact3>. Since <fact2>Block A is to the left of Block B</fact2>, and the small yellow circle is in Block A, it is to the left of the small yellow triangle. The medium yellow circle, which is in Block C, is above and to the right of the small yellow triangle, but not to the left of it. The answer is {A}.
### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Block A</fact1>, which is below Block B, contains a <fact1>big black square</fact1>. Since the <fact6>big black triangle</fact6> is in Block B and <fact5>Block A is directly below Block B</fact5>, the object directly below the <fact6>big black triangle</fact6> is the <fact1>big black square</fact1> in Block A. The answer is {A}.
### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact6>Block B contains the big blue square</fact6>, and <fact7>Block C, which is below Block A, contains both the medium yellow square</fact7> and the <fact8>medium yellow circle</fact8>. Since the <fact8>medium yellow circle is above the medium yellow square</fact8> and both are located in Block C, which is below Block A, neither of these objects is directly to the right of the <fact6>big blue square in Block B</fact6>. The answer is {D}.
