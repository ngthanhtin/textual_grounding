### TAGGED ANSWER:
The argument states that <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a Delta vacuum cleaner cleans</fact1> by just <fact2>knowing the power of its motor</fact2>. This is because the <fact3>dust filtration systems differ significantly</fact3> even between <fact4>models that have motors of the same power</fact4>. A does not align with the argument, as the efficiency of the <fact3>dust filtration systems was noted to vary significantly</fact3>, making <fact2>motor power alone insufficient to predict cleaning effectiveness</fact2>. B seems partially relevant, but the argument suggests that <fact2>motor power alone is not enough to determine effectiveness</fact2> due to the role of dust filtration systems. C directly aligns with the argument. The <fact3>efficiency of the dust filtration system</fact3> is emphasized as a key factor, even for models with the same motor power. D contradicts the argument by suggesting that motor power is the main factor, but the argument highlights the <fact3>varying dust filtration systems</fact3>. The answer is {C}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
The key point is that <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> was necessary for the chemical reactions, but <fact5>high levels of oxygen</fact5> would have blocked that light. This suggests that <fact5>oxygen levels</fact5> must have been very low or nearly absent during this time for the reactions to occur. Therefore, the diamonds' <fact3>high sulfur-33 concentration</fact3> indicates that <fact5>Earth's atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact5> had very little oxygen. A directly aligns with the argument since it matches the conditions required for <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> to reach Earth's surface and cause the reactions. B is unrelated to the argument, which focuses on the specific conditions of the atmosphere <fact2>2.9 billion years ago</fact2>, not the overall formation of diamonds. C is incorrect because <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> facilitates the reaction, but <fact5>oxygen</fact5> would block the light, not cause a reaction with <fact3>sulfur-33</fact3>. D is also incorrect as the argument does not state that <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> is necessary for <fact1>diamond</fact1> formation, only that it explains the <fact3>sulfur-33 concentration</fact3>. The answer is {A}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
Premise: <fact1>Cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to practical utility</fact1>. Conclusion: <fact2>Cabinetmaking is not art</fact2>. The question asks for an assumption that supports drawing this conclusion from the given reason. To bridge the gap between the premise and the conclusion, we need an assumption that links practical utility to the definition of art. A This statement about museum furniture doesn't help connect practical utility to the definition of art. It's irrelevant to the argument. B The monetary value of art is not mentioned in the original argument and doesn't relate to practical utility. This is also irrelevant. C This is a normative statement about what cabinetmakers should do, but it doesn't help us determine whether cabinetmaking is art or not based on practical utility. D This statement directly connects practical utility to the definition of art. It states that <fact3>if an object's maker considers practical utility, then the object is not art</fact3>. This assumption would indeed allow us to conclude that <fact2>cabinetmaking is not art</fact2> based on the <fact1>premise</fact1> that cabinetmakers consider practical utility. The answer is {D}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
A is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn't address the relationship between practical utility and art. B focuses on monetary value, which is unrelated to the argument about practical utility. C may reinforce <fact5>the importance</fact5> of practical utility in cabinetmaking but does not directly support the argument that cabinetmaking is not art. D aligns directly with the argument's reasoning, stating that an object's focus on utility disqualifies it from being classified as art. The answer is {C}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
The argument needs to be evaluated by determining whether the survey truly refutes the assumption that people don’t have enough free time to do both <fact1>computer-based activities</fact1> and <fact2>television viewing</fact2>. A key factor is understanding the context of how the time spent on <fact1>computers</fact1> is being measured. Specifically, if the survey includes time spent using <fact1>computers</fact1> at work, then it might not accurately reflect free-time media use. A fact is already stated in the argument, so confirming it wouldn’t provide new useful information. Option (b) is about time spent on media, not about money spent, so this wouldn't be directly useful in evaluating the argument. Option (c), while it could be interesting, doesn’t directly address the survey group that the argument is focused on, i.e., those who are increasing their <fact1>computer</fact1> use. Option (d) is crucial. If the time spent using <fact1>computers</fact1> includes work-related activities, then the survey does not accurately reflect the respondents' free time. The argument would be weakened because the increased <fact1>computer</fact1> time might not be taking away from <fact2>television viewing</fact2> due to the fact that much of it is happening during work hours. The answer is {D}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To weaken the argument, we need information that undermines the conclusion that the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> predates <fact5>Khafre</fact5>. Specifically, we need evidence that the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> may still have been altered or changed during <fact5>Khafre's</fact5> time, or that the face could have been recarved later. A does not address the specific erosion caused by <fact7>heavy rains</fact7>, so it doesn’t directly weaken the argument. B while this suggests stylistic similarities, it doesn’t provide a strong reason to doubt the conclusion about the erosion patterns or the age of the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1>. C is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn’t address the age of the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> or the erosion evidence. D <fact4>the face of the Sphinx</fact4> is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may have been recarved long after the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> was originally constructed, it could explain why <fact4>the face</fact4> resembles <fact5>Khafre</fact5> while the body and erosion patterns suggest an older origin. This suggests that the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> could still have been altered during <fact5>Khafre's</fact5> time, weakening the claim that <fact4>the face</fact4> couldn't be <fact5>Khafre's</fact5>. The answer is {D}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
We need to identify a flaw in the lawyer's reasoning. The lawyer is assuming that assigning highly qualified people to the project guarantees that the project would succeed, which overlooks several potential reasons the project could still fail, including factors outside of the team's qualifications. A is a valid flaw in the lawyer's reasoning because it’s possible that Congleton was not forced to assign these people, even if they were top-notch. B is another valid flaw. The witness might not have correctly inferred from the facts, but it doesn't mean they were intentionally lying. C is not a flaw in the reasoning—it accurately describes the lawyer's assumption. The lawyer is assuming that if the project failed, it would have been because Congleton wanted it to fail. This assumption supports the lawyer’s argument and is the point being taken for granted. D is another valid flaw. Even if the team members were top-notch, they might not have worked well together, leading to project failure. The answer is {C}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
Editor Y values the <fact1>attractiveness and composition</fact1> of the photograph, focusing on its visual appeal. Editor Z values a photograph’s <fact3>statement or purpose</fact3> and feels that, without <fact3>a clear reason for the smoke</fact3>, the photograph cannot be considered good despite being <fact2>attractive</fact2>. A is not the core of their disagreement. Both editors recognize that the photograph is <fact2>attractive</fact2>. B is the main point of disagreement. Editor Y believes that the photograph’s <fact4>attractiveness</fact4> makes it good, while Editor Z does not think <fact4>attractiveness alone makes a photograph good</fact4>. C while Editor Z might agree with this, Editor Y doesn’t directly reference whether a photograph needs to make a statement. D both editors agree that the photograph is <fact2>attractive</fact2>, so this doesn’t capture their disagreement about what makes a photograph good. The answer is {B}.
