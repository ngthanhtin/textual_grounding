## Question 1: 
### TAGGED QUESTION: 
Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble <fact1>1 widget every 10 minutes</fact1>. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together <fact2>2 complete widgets every 15 minutes</fact2>. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for <fact3>6 hours</fact3> before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for <fact4>4 hours</fact4> before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire <fact5>8-hour shift</fact5>. At the end of the day, they had completed <fact6>68 widgets</fact6>. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?

### ANSWER:
Sam completes a widget every 10 minutes. When Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget.
Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = 36 widgets.
Jack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = 16 widgets.
Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets.
It took Tony 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = 8*60/16=30 minutes per widget. The answer is {30}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Sam completes a widget every 10 minutes</fact1>. <fact2>When Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes</fact2>. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and <fact2>Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes</fact2>. So <fact2>it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget</fact2>.
<fact3>Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday</fact3>, so he was able to complete <fact3>6 hours</fact3> * 60 minutes per hour / <fact1>10 minutes per widget</fact1> = 36 widgets.
<fact4>Jack worked for 4 hours</fact4>, so he was able to complete <fact4>4 hours</fact4> * 60 minutes per hour / <fact2>15 minutes per widget</fact2> = 16 widgets.
Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete <fact6>68 widgets</fact6> together. So of those, Tony personally completed <fact6>68 widgets</fact6> - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets.
<fact5>It took Tony 8 hours</fact5> to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes <fact5>8 hours</fact5> * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = <fact5>8</fact5>*60/16=30 minutes per widget. The answer is {30}.

## Question 2: 
### TAGGED QUESTION: 
For <fact1>every 12 cans</fact1> you recycle, you receive <fact2>$0.50</fact2>, and for <fact3>every 5 kilograms of newspapers</fact3>, you receive <fact4>$1.50</fact4>. If your family collected <fact5>144 cans</fact5> and <fact6>20 kilograms of newspapers</fact6>, how much money would you receive?

### ANSWER:
There are 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $6 for the cans. There are 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected. So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12. The answer is {12}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
There are <fact5>144</fact5>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 12 sets of <fact1>12 cans</fact1> that the family collected. So, the family would receive <fact2>$0.50</fact2> x 12 = $6 for the cans. There are <fact6>20</fact6>/<fact3>5</fact3> = 4 sets of <fact3>5 kilograms of newspapers</fact3> that the family collected. So, the family would receive <fact4>$1.50</fact4> x 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12. The answer is {12}.

## Question 6: 
### TAGGED QUESTION:
The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eve, Mya, Rob, Ana, Ada, Mel, and Joe. <fact1>Eve finished third</fact1>. <fact2>Mya finished above Joe<fact2>. <fact3>Mel finished above Ada</fact3>. <fact4>Mya finished above Rob</fact4>. <fact5>Mel finished below Joe</fact5>. <fact6>Mya finished second</fact6>. <fact7>Ada finished second-to-last</fact7>. Options: (A) Eve finished last (B) Mya finished last (C) Rob finished last (D) Ana finished last (E) Ada finished last (F) Mel finished last (G) Joe finished last

### ANSWER:
To determine who finished last, we start by placing the golfers with known positions. Mya finished second and Eve finished third. Ada finished second-to-last, which is the sixth position. 
Next, we consider the relative positions: Mya finished above Joe, so Joe cannot be second. Mya finished above Rob, so Rob cannot be second. Mel finished below Joe, so Mel cannot be second. Therefore, Joe must be fourth, and Mel must be fifth. 
Mel finished above Ada, confirming Mel is fifth and Ada is sixth. This leaves Rob and Ana for the first and last positions. Since Mya finished above Rob, Rob cannot be first, so Ana must be first, leaving Rob in the last position.
Therefore, the answer is {C}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
To determine who finished last, we start by placing the golfers with known positions. <fact6>Mya finished second</fact6> and <fact1>Eve finished third</fact1>. <fact7>Ada finished second-to-last</fact7>, which is the sixth position. 
Next, we consider the relative positions: <fact2>Mya finished above Joe</fact2>, so Joe cannot be second. <fact4>Mya finished above Rob</fact4>, so Rob cannot be second. <fact5>Mel finished below Joe</fact5>, so Mel cannot be second. Therefore, Joe must be fourth, and Mel must be fifth. 
<fact3>Mel finished above Ada</fact3>, confirming Mel is fifth and Ada is sixth. This leaves Rob and Ana for the first and last positions. Since <fact4>Mya finished above Rob</fact4>, Rob cannot be first, so Ana must be first, leaving Rob in the last position.
Therefore, the answer is {C}.

## Question 7:
### TAGGED QUESTION:
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation? A machine is set up in such a way that it will <fact1>short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery</fact1> at the same time. The machine will <fact2>not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery</fact2>. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the <fact1>red wire and the black wire both end up touching</fact1> the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit? Options: - Yes - No

### ANSWER:
Condition for a short circuit: The machine is designed to short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery. If only one wire touches the battery, there will be no short circuit.
Designated roles: The black wire is the one that is supposed to touch the battery. The red wire is supposed to stay away from the battery.
What happened: Both the black wire and the red wire ended up touching the battery, which caused the short circuit.
Causation: Even though the black wire touched the battery (as expected), the short circuit was caused because both wires touched the battery. Thus, the black wire alone didn’t cause the short circuit—it was the combination of both wires touching the battery.
Conclusion: A typical person would say the black wire did not cause the short circuit alone; both wires contributed to the short circuit.
The answer is {no}.

## Question 8:
### TAGGED QUESTION:
<fact1>A coin is heads up</fact1>. roxas does <fact2>not flip</fact2> the coin. scheideman does <fact3>not flip</fact3> the coin.  Is the coin still heads up? Flip means reverse.

### ANSWER:
The coin started out being heads up. Roxas does not flip the coin, which means the coin remains in the same position. Scheideman also does not flip the coin, so again, there is no change in the coin's orientation. Since neither Roxas nor Scheideman flipped the coin (which would reverse its position), the coin remains heads up.
The answer is {yes}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>The coin started out being heads up</fact1>. Roxas does <fact2>not flip the coin</fact2>, which means the coin remains in the same position. Scheideman also does <fact3>not flip the coin</fact3>, so again, there is no change in the coin's orientation. Since <fact2><fact3>neither Roxas nor Scheideman flipped the coin </fact3></fact2> (which would reverse its position), the coin remains heads up.
The answer is {yes}.

## Question 13:
### TAGGED QUESTION:
Among the various models of Delta vacuum cleaners, <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a particular model cleans</fact1> simply by <fact2>determining how powerful its motor is</fact2>. The efficiency of <fact3>dust filtration systems varies significantly</fact3>, even between models of <fact4>Delta vacuum cleaners equipped with identically powerful motors</fact4>. The argument's conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
(a) All Delta vacuum cleaners that clean equally effectively have identically powerful motors.
(b) One cannot accurately assess how effectively any Delta vacuum cleaner cleans without knowing how powerful that vacuum cleaner's motor is.
(c) For each Delta vacuum cleaner, the efficiency of its dust filtration system has a significant impact on how effectively it cleans.
(d) For any two Delta vacuum cleaners with equally efficient dust filtration systems, the one with the more powerful motor cleans more effectively.

### ANSWER:
The argument states that one cannot accurately predict how effectively a Delta vacuum cleaner cleans by just knowing the power of its motor because dust filtration systems differ significantly even between models that have motors of the same power.
A does not align with the argument, as the efficiency of the dust filtration systems was noted to vary significantly, making motor power alone insufficient to predict cleaning effectiveness.
B seems partially relevant, but the argument suggests that motor power alone is not enough to determine effectiveness due to the role of dust filtration systems.
C directly aligns with the argument. The efficiency of the dust filtration system is emphasized as a key factor, even for models with the same motor power.
D contradicts the argument by suggesting that motor power is the main factor, but the argument highlights the varying dust filtration systems.
The answer is {C}.

## Question 14:
### TAGGED QUESTION:
We have three blocks, A, B, and C. <fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>. <fact2>Below block A is block B, which has one medium black square</fact2>. <fact3>To the left of block B, there is block C, which has two medium blue squares</fact3>. Medium blue square number one is below <fact4>medium blue square number two</fact4>. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? <fact1>A medium blue square that is in block A</fact1> or <fact4>a medium blue square number two</fact4>?

### ANSWER:
Block A has a medium blue square, and Block B (below A) has a black square. Block C, to the left of Block B, has two medium blue squares, with blue square number two on top and number one below it. Since the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B, the object to the left of the black thing is medium blue square number two. The answer is {B}.

### TAGGED ANSWER:
<fact1>Block A has a medium blue square</fact1>, and <fact2>Block B (below A) has a black square</fact2>. <fact3>Block C, to the left of Block B, has two medium blue squares</fact3>, with <fact4>blue square number two</fact4> on top and number one below it. Since <fact3>the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B</fact3>, the object to the left of the black thing is medium blue square number two.
